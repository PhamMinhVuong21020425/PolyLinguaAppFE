        "content": "Around Australia, travelers are stranded and trying to get home after low-cost airline Bonza unexpectedly announced it has “temporarily suspended services.”\nThe airline, Australia’s newest, had a fleet of six planes, all painted a bright purple color and given Aussie-inspired names like Sheila and Matilda.\nAccording to a report in CNN affiliate 9News, Bonza is now in severe financial trouble.\nIn a statement made on April 30, Bonza CEO Tim Jordan reportedly said that “discussions are currently underway regarding the ongoing viability of the business.”\n“We apologize to our customers who are impacted by this,” he added.\nRelated article\nHow the pandemic killed off 64 airlines\nCatherine King, Australia’s transportation minister, told reporters Tuesday that she had spoken with representatives from Bonza and urged them to keep passengers fully informed.\n“We have made it very clear to Bonza that our expectations are that they inform passengers about what their options are, what changes are being made, and that they respect their consumer rights, of which they do have some,” King said.\n“Our focus right at the moment is to assist Australian passengers who are stranded at the end of school holidays.”\nBonza launched with much fanfare in January 2023, using the slogan “Here for Allstralia.” It specialized in flying to smaller, under-served destinations like Launceston in Tasmania and Gladstone in Queensland.\nWhile that was a boon for residents of those areas, it has proven an additional challenge among those now struggling to get back home following Tuesday’s flight cancellations.\nRelated article\n‘I want to get off the plane.’ The passengers refusing to fly on Boeing’s 737 Max\nQantas, Australia’s largest air carrier, services only six of the 36 routes that Bonza has been flying. The airline said that any affected Bonza passenger can get a free ticket on a Qantas or Jetstar flight where seats are available, and has encouraged affected customers to call their hotline for help.\nVirgin Australia has also stepped into the breach.\n“We will immediately support any passengers stranded mid-journey by offering complimentary seats on Virgin Australia-operated flights to the airport nearest to their final planned Bonza destination,” the airline wrote on X (formerly Twitter).\nBonza’s last Instagram post went up on April 28.\nCurrently, the company’s website is still online, but it’s not possible to book flights and all travel dates appear blacked out.\n",

When performing at one of the most famous music festivals in the world, they stare past the blinding stage lights into the crowd to lock eyes with you. What transpires, naturally, is a whirlwind romance on the European leg of their sold out tour.\nIt’s a fantasy that — in some variation or another — has captured the human imagination for decades. Films such as “What Price Hollywood” and “A Star is Born” first dabbled in the idea of famous and non-famous relations almost 100 years ago. By 1999, the genre had reached new heights after the release of “Notting Hill” — the seminal Richard Curtis film which saw Julia Roberts, a graceful American movie star, fall for Hugh Grant, a bumbling British bookstore owner. Even more recently, “Starstruck,” the coincidental title of both a 2010 Disney Channel original movie and a 2021 BBC Three series, brought the agony and ecstasy of dating an A-lister as a mere member of the public to the small screen.\nNow, director Michael Showalter breathes new life into the trope with “The Idea of You,” out on Amazon Prime May 2. Based on the 2017 Robinne Lee novel by the same name, Showalter’s version is set in LA — the birthplace of lofty pipe dreams — starring both Anne Hathaway as Solène Marchand, a glamorous 40-year-old art gallery owner and divorced mother of one; and Nicholas Galitzine as 24-year-old Hayes Campbell, the fan favorite of fictional boy band du jour, August Moon.\nAfter a meet cute in Hayes’ trailer at Coachella, sparks fly and Solène finds herself being pursued by not only a fully fledged celebrity, but someone 16 years her junior. The internet hasn’t been shy in drawing parallels between Lee’s novel and the age gap relationship of Harry Styles and Olivia Wilde. And although the book was published four years before the pair began dating, Lee admitted she was intrigued by Styles’ life in particular. “Inspired is a strong word,” she told Vogue in 2020.\nBut more than just a piece of starry-eyed fan-fiction, “The Idea of You” is a Bildungsroman in disguise. Particularly in relation to the acutely female struggle for identity and individuality after motherhood. “We talk about coming-of-age stories as being something that happens in (the) earliest part of your life,” said Anne Hathaway at the film’s SXSW premiere. “I don’t know about you, but I feel like I keep blooming.”\nFlawed, hopeful, vulnerable yet composed, Solène’s three-dimensional character disrupts the misogynistic binary of cougar or crone. It was a consideration costume designer Jacqueline Demeterio took seriously when sourcing her wardrobe. “Solène’s 40. I mean, 40 is not old,” she said. “I didn’t want it to be this older lady meets this younger boy… and has this ‘Pretty Woman’ (makeover) moment.” There wasn’t a stitch of leopard print, teenage fashion or “Golden Girls” style pussybows. “She has her look,” said Demeterio. “She’s not trying to look young, but (her style) has evolved with time and with her body. You make adjustments, but you still dress cool.”\nFrom the first scene, Solène’s sartorial compass is established in a denim puff-sleeve dress from Chloé’s Fall-Winter 2023 collection and a pair of blonde suede Isabel Marant boots. It was the first look Hathaway tried on during fittings with Demeterio in New York. “I was like, ‘Yeah, this is Solène.’”\nHer fashion needle doesn’t deviate much throughout the film, as we see Solène in more Marant (a suede tote bag makes several appearances as an intentional nod to realistic rewearing), Etro, Gabriella Hearst, Valentino and vintage Chanel. These are the types of sophisticated yet understated labels you might expect a successful gallery owner to buy — quietly luxurious, sometimes sustainably minded and with a price tag accessible to a woman in her peak earning years.\nBut while Demeterio — who is a similar age to both Solène and Hathaway — was able to draw on personal taste and experience to flesh out the character, getting into the mind (and closet) of a 20-somethings heartthrob was different. “I tried some different directions with the wardrobe,” she said. “At first I went a little David Bowie, a little androgynous with the silk blouses and flared trousers. But I felt I was getting a little too showman and I didn’t want it to be a distraction.” And if the fashion sense of one young musician felt hard to pin down, there was also the question of outfitting August Moon. “There’s so many ways to go with a boyband,” Demeterio said. “There’s the BTS suits and matching Prada, or vintage pieces mixed in with streetwear, which is where I went with that.”\nRelated article\nHow ‘The Crown’ recreated Kate Middleton’s 2000s style\nHarry Styles was of course on the moodboard for Hayes — the patchwork tattoos and soft knit cardigans were a dead giveaway — but Demeterio insists this wasn’t an impression. “I didn’t want it to be, you know, he’s Harry,” she said. “Nick and I were sending images back and forth and one of his (ideas) was Matty Healy.” (On screen Hayes performed at Coachella in a pair of suit trousers and cotton vest — an outfit formula beloved by The 1975 singer). What stuck were elevated classics: A Bottega Veneta tank top, expertly fitted Loewe trousers or luxurious cardigans (again, by Isabel Marant). “Someone of his level would have his stylist go and buy designer pieces, even though it’s just (say) a cardigan. It’s the way it sits,” she said. And for those who want to recreate the A-lister off-duty look at home: Tailor your T-shirts, says Demeterio. “Nick would bring in his personal wardrobe like, ‘Can I have this shortened? Can your tailor come and shorten this?’” she laughed. “I created a monster of perfect T-shirt proportions.”\nPerhaps the most important element of Demeterio’s work was accurately reflecting the character’s 16 year age gap through clothes. When Hayes tracks down Solène at her Silver Lakes art gallery, for example, Nick appears in a slouchy cardi, white tank and snapback cap while Hathaway is dressed in a structured velvet blazer. They are star-crossed lovers, their doomed fate spelled out in apparel rather than astrology. During one of their last encounters, Hayes stands at the door, his enveloping oversized hoodie rendering him as diminished and slight as a wide-eyed adolescent. “I went back and forth on that,” Demeterio said. “Because I thought, does he look too juvenile? But this is showing the emotional struggle through the wardrobe. It was really because of what society was saying about the age gap, so I wanted it to be in your face a little bit.”\nBut if “The Idea of You” subverts any clichés in this particular rom-com genre, it’s that the celebrity must be more glamorous than their normie love interest. Constance Bennett in “What Price Hollywood” is discovered in her waitress uniform by Lowell Sherman, a suited-and-booted big-time director. In “Notting Hill,” Grant was relegated to a rotation of periwinkle blue button-downs while Roberts swanned about in her leather blazer and black beret. As for Hathaway, we find her in Chanel and leave her, happily ever after, in a rust-red Gabriela Hearst suit.\n",

        "content": "Donald Trump will make his most concentrated effort yet to turn his criminal trial into a political asset in the next two days, heading from the courtroom to the campaign trail and back again.\nThe former president’s hush money trial resumes in New York on Tuesday as prosecutors seek to prove that Trump falsified business records to cover up an alleged affair and thereby interfered in the 2016 election by misleading voters. They’ve been unwilling to reveal witnesses in advance in order to shield them from Trump’s attacks. But they are expected to press on with questioning a former banker for Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer and fixer who made hush money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, who alleged the affair that Trump denies. Trump has pleaded not guilty in the case.\nWith court dark on Wednesday, the presumptive GOP nominee will fly to the epicenter of his clash with President Joe Biden, making stops in two swing states, Wisconsin and Michigan, that could decide the destiny of the White House. The trip will show how useful it is for an indicted candidate to have his own plane. But more significantly, this will be Trump’s most intense campaign travel in weeks, and he is sure to dig in on his false claims that his four indictments were directly instigated by the White House.\nTrump’s return to full-time campaigning will be fleeting, however. He must be back in court Thursday — when Judge Juan Merchan will hold another hearing over prosecution claims he’s regularly violating a partial gag order meant to protect witnesses, court staff and even the judge’s own family.\nThe juxtaposition between campaigning — where Trump will revert to his domineering political persona — and his mute disempowerment in the courtroom, where the judge is in charge, will be another remarkable moment in a presidential election campaign like no other. It will emphasize how the 2024 White House race is so far being shaped as much by what happens in court as in traditional campaigning. And it will underscore how Trump has made his defense in multiple criminal cases the same as his central campaign theme — that he’s effectively a political dissident who is the victim of unwarranted persecution.\nThe presumptive GOP nominee tells his supporters that he’s being targeted  because he’s preventing the same thing from happening to them. “I am your justice and for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution,” he told the Conservative Political Action Conference last year.\nThe opening week of the prosecution case contained detailed testimony that appeared to be damaging to Trump as former tabloid publisher David Pecker detailed “catch and kill” schemes that the ex-president allegedly used to suppress negative stories and attorneys teased out evidence about alleged financial irregularities.\n“It was election fraud. Pure and simple,” prosecutor Matthew Colangelo said in his opening statement. Trump’s counsel Todd Blanche countered: “I have a spoiler alert. There is nothing wrong with trying to influence an election. It’s called democracy.”\nThe ex-president is playing to a jury made up to tens of millions of voters. It is too early to tell how the electorate might respond to a conviction in the case or whether Trump could get a political boost if he is acquitted. The lesson of the Trump era, however, is that the ex-president’s supporters often see attempts to call him to legal account as an example of unfair victimization.\nRelated article\nCNN Poll: Few think Trump is being treated the same as other defendants\nCNN polling released last week suggests that there is no dominant public view on the trial, but that does not preclude the possibility that a guilty verdict could damage the former president. Only 44% of Americans expressed confidence that the jury will reach a fair verdict. Not surprisingly, a majority of Democrats feel that Trump is being treated more leniently than others, while a majority of Republicans think the opposite. One area of potential concern for Trump, however, is that 24% of his backers say a conviction might cause them to reconsider their support — although the overwhelming majority say they would not vote for Biden.\nTrump’s appearances in Wisconsin and Michigan will give him a more traditional platform than the dingy courtroom corridor where he’s been delivering daily screeds against the case and spinning a dystopian vision of a nation on the verge of collapse. But there’s also a risk Trump’s loose tongue out on the trail could get him into trouble following his alleged violations of Merchan’s gag order.\nThe former president has been complaining that he’s been penned up in court and unable to effectively campaign. “I’m not in Georgia, or Florida or North Carolina, campaigning like I should be. This is about election interference,” he said earlier this month. But he spent the trial’s off day last Wednesday playing golf at his course in Bedminster, New Jersey, CNN reported. Still, the four-day-a-week court schedule does present its constraints. Trump, for example, has yet to reschedule a rally that had been due to take place on April 20 in North Carolina but was cancelled because of a dangerous storm.\nIn the meantime, Trump’s allies are pushing the persecution theme. “I think all these trials are political. I think it’s selective prosecution. I think what’s going on in New York is an outrage,” Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. This view ignores the fact that all of the indictments emerged from grand juries and according to established legal procedure and that some of Trump’s alleged crimes strike at the heart of America’s bedrock political system. But such rhetoric is convincing to Trump supporters and is repeated in a daily drumbeat on conservative media in order to disguise the nature of the charges.\nTrump’s itinerary on Wednesday reflects the critical importance of two states that he won in 2016 but lost to Biden on his way out of the White House in 2020. Battleground polls published by CBS News on Sunday showed the rivals neck-and-neck in Wisconsin and Michigan. They were also tied in Pennsylvania, a third swing state Biden flipped from Trump four years ago. The president’s hopes of a second term probably rest on him winning at least two of the three states to get to 270 electoral votes. Biden has made multiple campaign stops while the ex-president has been stuck in New York.\nRelated article\nCNN Poll: Trump maintains lead over Biden in 2024 matchup as views on their presidencies diverge\nThe Trump campaign is billing the presumptive GOP nominee’s trip to Waukesha, Wisconsin, as a chance to highlight the “the peace, prosperity, and security of his first term with Joe Biden’s failed presidency.” That might seem like a hard case to make for a twice-impeached former president who attempted to crush US democracy to stay in office.\nYet, a new CNN poll released Sunday suggests that Trump’s message might be resonating with some voters at a time of high grocery prices, elevated interest rates and turmoil abroad. Some 55% of Americans now see the ex-president’s term as successful, while 61% think that Biden’s presidency is a failure, according to the poll. Biden’s ratings are especially poor on the economy, immigration and on his handling of Israel’s war in Gaza against Hamas, an issue that is especially important to voters under 35, a key sector of the Democratic coalition.\nThe former president and his allies are already seizing on the countrywide pro-Palestinian protests at college campuses to embroider their claims of a nation under siege from left-wing extremists on Biden’s watch. While the protests typically only include a minority of students at each campus and have not reached anywhere near the momentum of Vietnam War or civil rights-era demonstrations, television footage of police confronting students holding sit-ins contains emotive imagery that can be used selectively in the kind of demagogic campaign that Trump is running. Any sense of political unrest among voters could draw some of them toward his warnings that America needs tough, strongman leadership. The former president last week said that the current campus protests made the 2017 rally by White extremists in Charlottesville, Virginia – in which a woman died – look like a “peanut.” But the campus protests have been mostly peaceful — unlike the mob of Trump supporters that came to Washington and smashed its way into the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.\nThe campus demonstrations have split the Democratic Party down the middle – a divide House Speaker Mike Johnson sought to widen last week by traveling to Columbia University and calling for the National Guard to be deployed to break up demonstrations.\nHis decision to seize the issue underscored the way campaigns construct narratives that may not be completely true but that can be politically potent if they play into perceptions voters are already forming. Trump is following a similar playbook as he fuses his criminal defense as a supposed victim of partisan persecution with his political offensive for a White House comeback.\n",

The pair appeared to be on good form, smiling and waving at well-wishers gathered nearby on arrival before being welcomed to the hospital by medical staff.\nCamilla, 76, has been president of cancer care and support charity Maggie’s since 2008.\nThe King has largely remained out of the public eye during his treatment so far, apart from an outing on Easter Sunday when he delighted crowds with an impromptu walkabout after attending church with several family members.\nTuesday’s visit to University College Hospital Macmillan Cancer Centre was to reiterate the value of early diagnosis and focus attention on some of the innovative research taking place there.\nThe King has been refreshingly open about his health, particularly in comparison to his predecessors. His first major public engagement since his diagnosis is very much a continuation of his desire to raise awareness and encourage the public to seek advice if they notice any possible symptoms.\nHe leaned on his own recent personal experience when talking to medical teams as well as while connecting with patients and their families on Tuesday.\nWhile being given a tour of the medical unit, which supports the identification and treatment of a wide range of cancer conditions, he was shown how CT scanners are helping with early detection. During his visit, he frequently asked questions and made comments about the importance of early diagnosis.\nLater, he sat down with several cancer patients including Lesley Woodbridge, who was receiving chemotherapy as the monarch stopped by. While chatting, he told her, “I’ve got to have my treatment this afternoon as well,” according to the UK’s PA Media news agency. Charles himself has been receiving unspecified outpatient treatment over the last three months.\nThe King’s outing came as he was announced as the new patron of Cancer Research UK.

        "content": "Thick murky clouds fill the sky, with freezing winds carrying snow faster than 100 miles per hour. With a frigid –30 degrees Fahrenheit temperature, life-threatening snowstorms and avalanches are frequent.\nAnd these are typical conditions on the world’s highest mountain: Mount Everest.\nThe behemoth towers 29,032 feet (8,849 meters) between Nepal and Tibet in the Himalayas, with its peak surpassing most clouds in the sky.\nAn attempt to climb Everest requires months, sometimes years, of training and conditioning – even then, reaching the summit is far from guaranteed. In fact, more than 300 people are known to have died on the mountain.\nAnd yet the mountain still draws hundreds of climbers who are determined to reach its peak every spring. Here’s what it takes to make the climb and what has motivated some climbers to summit the world’s highest peak.\nDr. Jacob Weasel, a trauma surgeon, successfully summited Everest last May after conditioning for nearly a year.\n“I would put on a 50-pound backpack and do two hours on a stair stepper with no problem,” Weasel told CNN. “So, I thought that I was in pretty good shape.” However, the surgeon said he was humbled after discovering that his fitness was no match for the lofty athleticism required by the mountain.\n“I would take five steps and have to take 30 seconds to a minute to catch my breath,” Weasel recalled of his struggle with the lack of oxygen available while ascending Everest.\nClimbers aiming for the summit usually practice an acclimatizing rotation to adjust their lungs to the thinning oxygen levels once they arrive on the mountain. This process involves mountaineers traveling upward to one of the four designated camps on Everest and spending one to four days there before traveling back down.\nRelated article\nIf you’re dreaming of climbing Mount Everest, this is what it takes\nThis routine is repeated at least two times to allow the body to adapt to declining oxygen levels. It increases a climber’s chances of survival and summiting.\n“If you took somebody and just plopped them up at the high camp on Everest, not even on the (top), they would probably go into a coma within 10 to 15 minutes,” Weasel said.\n“And they would be dead within an hour because their body is not adjusted to that low of oxygen levels.”\nWhile Weasel has successfully summited dozens of mountains, including Kilimanjaro (19,341 ft), Chimborazo (20, 549 ft), Cotopaxi (19,347 ft), and most recently Aconcagua (22,837 ft) in January, he said none of them compares to the high-altitude of Mount Everest.\n“Because no matter how well you are trained, once you get to the limits of what the human body can take, it’s just difficult,” he continued.\nAt its highest altitude, Everest is nearly incapable of sustaining human life and most mountaineers use supplementary oxygen above 23,000 feet. The lack of oxygen poses one of greatest threats to climbers who attempt to summit, with levels dropping to less than 40% when they reach the Everest “death zone.”\nThe first target for mountaineers is Everest base camp at approximately 17,000 feet, which takes climbers about two weeks. Then they ascend to the three remaining camps stationed along the mountain.\nCamp four, the final one before the summit, sits along the edge of the death zone at 26,000 feet, exposing climbers to an extremely thin layer of air, subzero temperatures, and high winds powerful enough to blow a person off the mountain.\nRelated article\nSherpa who saved climber in Everest death zone says it was hardest rescue ‘in my life’\n“It’s difficult to survive up there,” Weasel told CNN. He recalls passing bodies of climbers who died on the mountain – which isn’t uncommon. The bodies of the fallen mountaineers are well-preserved, exhibiting little to no decay due to the intense cold temperatures.\n“I am probably more familiar with death and the loss of life than most people,” the surgeon said. “For me it was just a reminder of the gravity of the situation and the fragility of what life is… even more so motivation for appreciating the opportunity.”\nHigh-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) is one of the most common illnesses climbers face while attempting to summit. “Your brain is starved of oxygen,” Weasel said.\nHACE results in the brain swelling during its attempt to regain stable oxygen levels, causing drowsiness, trouble speaking and thinking. This confusion is often accompanied by blurred vision and sporadic episodes of delusion.\n“I had auditory hallucinations where I was hearing voices [of friends] that I thought were coming from behind me,” Weasel recalled. “And I had visual hallucinations,” he added. “I was seeing the faces of my children and my wife coming out of the rocks.”\nWeasel recalled crossing paths with a friend, Orianne Aymard, who was trapped on the mountain due to an injury. “I remember staring at her for like five minutes and just saying, ‘I’m so sorry,’” Weasel said.\n“I’ve spent over a decade of my life training to help people as a surgeon, and being in a position where there’s somebody who requires your help and you are unable to offer any assistance… that feeling of helplessness was tough to deal with,” Weasel told CNN.\nAymard survived. She was rescued and suffered from several broken bones in her foot, in addition to severe frostbite on her hands. Despite all her injuries, Aymard is considered one of the lucky ones.\nEverest has long been a tomb for climbers who have succumbed to harsh conditions or accidents on its slopes.\nWhen a loved one or fellow climber is severely injured or dies on the mountain, it’s routine to leave them behind if you’re unable to save them, according to Alan Arnette, a mountaineer coach who summited Everest in 2014.\n“What most teams do out of respect for that climber, they will move the body out of sight,” he said. And that’s only if they can.\n“Sometimes that’s just not practical because of the bad weather, or because their bodies will get frozen into the mountain,” Arnette told CNN. “So, it’s very difficult to move them.”\nRelated article\nMount Everest: Nepal to remove trash and dead bodies from world’s tallest mountain\nSeeing a corpse on Everest is comparable to seeing a horrible car accident, according to the mountain coach. “You don’t turn around and go home,” Arnette said. “You respectfully slow down… or say a prayer for that person, and then you continue.”\nIt’s been 10 years since the single deadliest accident on the world’s highest mountain, after an avalanche killed 12 Sherpa guides. And 2023 was recorded as the deadliest year on Everest, with 18 fatalities on the mountain – including five people that are still unaccounted for.\nThe process of recovering bodies is extensive, sometimes impossible. Helicopter rescues and search missions are challenging due to the high altitude and frequently treacherous conditions, resulting in some rescuers dying in their attempt to save others.\nThe 3,000 feet climb from camp four to the summit can take anywhere from 14 to 18 hours. Therefore, mountaineers typically leave the camp at night.\n“That entire night was cold,” Weasel recalled. “It’s dark, it’s windy.” But it was proven to be worth it in the morning, he said.\n“Watching the sunrise from 29,000 feet and having that pyramid of Everest’s shadow projected onto the valley below you…,” Weasel told CNN. “It was probably one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen in my life,” he continued.\n“It’s weird standing up there and knowing that everything else on the planet is below where you’re standing.”\nThe size of the mountain is humbling, the surgeon said. “I’ve never felt so small,” he recalled. “That mixture of humility and connectedness with something bigger than yourself is the proper place from which we ought to approach our existence on this planet.”\nLike Weasel, Arnette summited at sunrise, and experienced this same feeling of “smallness.” At the top there were “more mountains than you can count,” Arnette remembered. “It was a sense of enormous gratitude and at the same time I knew I had to get back down.”\nAfter about 20 minutes to an hour, climbers typically start to descend back to the base of the mountain.\nBefore leaving for Nepal, Weasel was gifted an eagle’s feather as a beacon for his Native American heritage.\nHe was determined to plant the feather on top of Everest “as a symbol of our people and what we’ve endured for the past several hundred years,” Weasel told CNN. “Showing that our spirit is not broken, but we’re able to rise above the things that have happened to us,” he added.\n“I remember planting that eagle’s feather on the top of the world and the feeling of real privilege that I felt in representing our people.” And this is why he decided to summit Everest, to be an example that anything is possible for young Native children and his tribe.\n“Knowing what it’s like up there, for me personally, the only real justification for going and putting your life, and other lives, at risk is if you’re climbing for a reason that is much bigger than you,” said Weasel.\nArnette attempted to climb Everest three times before he successfully summited.\nRelated article\nNepal to require all Mount Everest climbers to use a tracking chip\n“My first three tries, I wasn’t clear on my why,” Arnette said. When his mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, he looked at his purpose for climbing differently.\n“I wanted to do it to raise money for Alzheimer’s and honor my mother,” Arnette said.\nThere are approximately 300 people that have been issued a permit from the Nepal government to climb the mountain this year, according to Arnette. And he said the number is down from previous years.\n“I think one of the reasons is because we had the 18 deaths last year, and people realize that Mount Everest is a dangerous mountain.”\nHowever, he doesn’t believe that should deter climbers from attempting to summit. “I’m a big believer that when you go climb these mountains that you come home a better version of yourself,” Arnette told CNN.\n“Everest has become too commercialized with ‘you’re stepping over dead bodies’ and ‘it’s littered with trash,’” the mountain coach said. “The reality is that it is a very small degree all of that, but there’s a lot of joy that people get out of doing it,” he continued.\n“And that’s the reason that we climb mountains.”\n",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.\nWelcome to week two of the Trump 2016 election interference trial.\nLast week was dominated by the drama of star witness David Pecker, the former National Enquirer publisher who brought to life for the jury the “catch-and-kill” schemes that prosecutors say were intended to benefit Trump’s campaign. But after he finished his testimony Friday afternoon, we settled into what is likely to be the next phase of the case: getting all the evidence in. That means some less dramatic intervals are ahead. But because the narrative and the stakes were made so clear in week one, week two is likely to sustain the interest of the jury and all of us – even if it may not stop the defendant’s penchant for napping.\nThose of us who spend time in courtrooms know trials can’t always be “Law & Order,” in which prosecutors elicit damning testimony – and sometimes even outright confessions – from witnesses every time one takes the stand. In the real world, lawyers also have to prove every element of their case. And the case Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg brought is, at heart, a documents case – Trump has been charged with 34 counts of felony record falsification, actions allegedly taken to cover up hush money payoffs connected to the 2016 election. So the prosecutors will need to take the time to present all the documentation to prove that the allegedly illicit payments were made and that the allegedly criminal false documentation was filed.\nBut as demonstrated by longtime Trump assistant Rhona Graff’s testimony Friday afternoon, the methodical nature of the testimony and evidence doesn’t mean it will be dull for the jury. Juries adapt to the ebb and flow of a trial, and this jury was attentive to Graff’s words about maintaining contact information for two of Trump’s alleged paramours who prosecutors say received secret payoffs to benefit the Trump campaign: Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels. Some jurors took copious notes and others listened closely.\nPecker had introduced them to a starry world of celebrities and sex scandals, and an alleged backroom deal with a presidency in the balance. Now we are building the details out, piece by piece. So if last week evoked primetime soaps such as “Dallas” and “Dynasty,” this week promises to be “Columbo”– a police procedural putting together all the clues needed to solve the mystery.\nRelated article\nOpinion: Trump attorney’s embarrassing courtroom apology\nThis type of testimony, though technical, is essential: Prosecutors can’t just stand up and assert certain payments were made, or present to the jury a document that has not been authenticated and introduced as evidence. The DA has to establish every factual element, and they will do that through the reams of documents that will be introduced into evidence this week. That proof will also help corroborate the testimony of future witnesses, like former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, who arranged hush money payments, and payoff recipient Daniels. And any omissions or misrepresentations in documents also help show the intent to cover up the payment scheme to benefit the campaign.\nThe testimony of Gary Farro, Cohen’s onetime banker, is emblematic of what we are likely to hear from other witnesses this week. Farro began testifying on Friday after Graff, and the prosecution had him corroborate various bank records related to the formation of the limited liability companies that Cohen created as part of the alleged scheme to bury damaging stories during the presidential campaign.\nFor example, Assistant District Attorney Rebecca Mangold had Farro verify one record in which Cohen offered a detailed description of the purpose of the limited liability company that he had created to facilitate payments to McDougal, one of those who claimed to have had an affair with Trump – but Cohen omitted any mention about acquiring the rights to her potentially damaging story. Mangold also had Farro verify a bank record for the LLC that Cohen had created to facilitate the payments to Daniels on which Cohen affirmed that the entity was not associated with political fundraising. Prosecutors allege the entity was formed to do the exact opposite: make a payoff to influence an election.\nSomething that separates good lawyers from great ones is how they handle the less juicy bits of a trial. The Manhattan prosecutors trying this case have already proven their mettle – and I expect they will march through these documentation witnesses thoroughly but expeditiously, keeping things moving so that the jury’s attention does not wander too far.\n\nTrump’s lawyers are also competent, so expect them to get what they can from the witnesses. When defense counsel elicited from Graff on cross-examination that Trump was a good boss, she became a free character witness. And while it’s true that, after her testimony concluded, Graff politely rebuffed Trump’s attempt to shake her hand, that alone won’t undermine her positive character testimony (even if it might strike jurors as odd).\nSometimes the defense will stipulate – that is, simply agree with the prosecution – to much of this evidentiary work in an effort to get it over with. It’s coming in to evidence anyhow if prosecutors are competent (which these certainly are). But that doesn’t seem to be happening here. Trump and his counsel are the masters of delay – trying to squeeze every moment of postponement out of the process that they can. After all, the longer this case goes, the further away they can push the scheduling of any other of the criminal trials against him. Accordingly, Team Trump appears to be forcing the DA team to go step by step.\nSo the jury may be dealing with a relatively more mundane set of topics on and off over the next few days – but they seem up for seeing it through and even interested. And while the odds that Trump may fall asleep again remain high, he would be wiser to remain alert as prosecutors build their case piece by piece.\n",

The ruling on Tuesday only concerned whether or not Berlin should be ordered to immediately stop selling arms to Israel.\nReading the ruling, Salam said the court was “concerned about the catastrophic living conditions of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, including prolonged deprivation of food and basic necessities.”\nThe case against Germany was brought by Nicaragua. A long-time supporter of the Palestinian cause, the Central American country accused Germany of violating its obligations as a signatory of the Genocide Convention through its political, financial and military support for Israel, and by suspending funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA).\nGermany suspended the funding in January amid allegations that 12 of the UN agency’s employees were involved in the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7. It has since reinstated it.\nGermany “welcomed the ICJ ruling” according to a statement posted by the German Foreign Ministry on X shortly after the announcement. In the statement, the ministry added that “Germany is not a party in the conflict in the Middle East” and added: “to the contrary, Germany is working day and night for a two-state solution.”\nIsrael was not a party to the case, but the ruling on Tuesday comes as the ICJ is hearing a separate case brought against Israel by South Africa. In January, the court issued an interim ruling ordering Israel to prevent genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, but stopped short of calling for Israel to suspend its military campaign, as South Africa had requested. The ICJ is still considering whether Israel is guilty of violating the Genocide Convention, a legal process that could take years.\nThis story has been updated.\nCNN’s Abel Alvarado and Tamar Michaelis contributed reporting.\n",

        "publishedAt": "8:45 PM EDT, Mon April 29, 2024",
        "content": "Indian weddings are notoriously elaborate affairs, requiring a multitude of outfit changes for multiple days of festivities.\nIt used to be normal for a family visiting Brij Kishore Agarwal’s sari shop, near the narrow lanes of Chandni Chowk market in India’s Old Delhi, to depart with a big bundle of bright, embroidered garments and leave behind a substantial pile of cash.\nWorries that someone would break in and steal the money before he could make a bank deposit kept the store’s now-79-year-old owner awake at night.\nThese days he sleeps easier, because almost all his customers use e-payments to complete their purchases.\n“I have seen this country change,” says Agarwal, who has worked in the shop for about 65 years. “We very rarely get cash payments.”\nDigital payments, made through systems like the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), which allow users to transfer funds instantly by scanning a QR code, have become ubiquitous across the world’s most populous country, transforming daily life.\nIn Delhi, tea sellers collect rupees via mobile apps, and tuk tuk drivers who pull over to buy parathas stuffed with steaming hot paneer pay with their phones.\nThe e-payment revolution is also likely to play an important role in India’s attempts to become an economic superpower. It is the planet’s fifth biggest economy, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is currently running for his third consecutive term, has said he wants India to be considered “developed” by 2047.\n“Digital payments are likely to enhance India’s growth by eliminating frictions, increasing efficiency, and reducing costs,” Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University, told CNN. “UPI and the broader digitization of the economy could also increase the inclusiveness of this growth,” he added.\nIndia’s push to digitize its society started about 15 years ago, but e-payments were slow to catch on. In 2016, 96% of transactions in India were still conducted with banknotes.\nTwo events that year changed things. First, the non-profit National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), an initiative of the central bank and a banking association, launched the payment infrastructure UPI.\nUPI allows users to use their phone as a virtual debit card, transferring money from almost 600 member banks and fintech companies instantly without entering bank details or paying transaction fees.\nLater that year, the government suddenly scrapped two large banknotes that comprised 86% of all currency in circulation, with the stated goal of fighting corruption. That prompted a surge in the use of e-payments.\n“We had no choice,” says Ramesh Kumar, 52, a towel shop owner in Delhi’s Sarojini Nagar Market, who started accepting digital payments in 2016.\nCovid-19 further boosted the adoption of digital transactions, as people tried to protect themselves from the virus.\nNow, Indians use UPI to pay everyone from vegetable vendors to doctors. More digital transactions are completed in India than any other country, according to the government. In 2023, the number of UPI transactions topped 100 billion.\nThere are some holdouts. Azeez, a 34-year-old rickshaw driver in Old Delhi, told CNN that he’s too scared of losing money to use e-payments.\n“I am [an] uneducated person, I am poor, I have never been to a school, I can’t read or write,” he says. “What if I make a mistake?”\nStill, the upward trend is expected to continue, further boosting the number and value of funds flowing into the formal economy. UPI is aiming for two billion transactions a day by 2030.\n“If I can, and my store, which is so old, can move forward and change like this, I am sure every buyer and customer will also do it,” says Agarwal, the sari seller.\nIndia is the world’s fastest-growing major economy and digitization “has played a fairly consequential role in the very successful economic trajectory that India is on,” says Prasad, who is the author of “The Future of Money: How the Digital Revolution Is Transforming Currencies and Finance.”\nAlthough it’s difficult to quantify the impact that UPI adoption has had on India’s gross domestic product, on a micro level it’s easy to see how it’s making a difference. Agarwal says it has increased efficiency and transparency for his business, and made filing taxes simpler.\nKapil Sharma, 42, who sells flowers for as little as $0.12 outside a temple in Old Delhi, told CNN he used to lose business because potential customers wouldn’t want to wait for change. He started using UPI about a year ago and has seen an uptick in sales.\n“It’s just simpler,” he says. “They buy, pay and go.”\nConvenience aside, India’s digital public infrastructure has helped it achieve an 80% financial inclusion rate. Although inequality remains a problem, Prasad says that digitization has “made Indian citizens, including the masses who are not very wealthy, feel that they have a stake in India’s economic growth and transformation.”\nNow NPCI is focused on expanding overseas to make it easier for citizens working abroad to send remittances home or allow Indian travellers to pay using UPI. This year, the Eiffel Tower’s website started accepting payment via UPI.\n“I think the government sees the UPI as a template for the rest of the world,” says Prasad. “I think it would certainly help India’s stature on the world stage.”\nNo matter its future impact outside India, UPI appears to have strong grassroots support from those who have already benefitted from it, which means its dominance in the South Asian nation is likely to grow.\n“If anyone gives me an option to go back to cash payment, I will just say I am not interested,” says Agarwal. “Please find a phone, download these apps, and use them.”\n",

No injuries were reported.\nIn a post on social platform Weibo Tuesday, the China Coast Guard said it had expelled the Philippine vessels for “intruding” into the waters, “in accordance with the law.”\nBeijing asserts ownership over almost all of the South China Sea in defiance of an international court ruling. Over the past two decades, China has occupied a number of obscure reefs and atolls far from its shoreline across the South China Sea, building up military installations, including runways and ports.\nRelated article\nWhat it’s like on board an outnumbered Philippine ship facing down China’s push to dominate the South China Sea\nScarborough Shoal, which China calls Huangyan Island and is also known as Bajo de Masinloc, is a small but strategic reef and fertile fishing ground.\nThere are no structures on the shoal, but China has maintained a continuous coast guard presence around it since 2012, according to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative.\nThe Philippines also said Tuesday that China had reinstalled a 380-meter (1,247-feet) floating barrier that “covers the entire entrance of the shoal, effectively restricting access to the area.”\nScarborough Shoal is one of several disputed islands and reefs in the South China Sea, which have long been a flashpoint of territorial disputes between the two nations.\nIn March, Chinese coast guard ships fired water cannons against a Philippine vessel on a resupply mission to a contingent of Filipino marines on another contested South China Sea feature, Second Thomas Shoal, causing “heavy damages.”\nThat shoal sits about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the coast of the Philippine island of Palawan. In the 1990s the Philippines grounded an aging World War II-era transport ship called the BRP Sierra Madre on the shoal, to help enforce its claim to the area. The ship is now mostly a rusted wreckage and is staffed by marines stationed on rotation.\nFollowing that incident, the China Coast Guard said on Weibo it had taken “control measures in accordance with the law” against the Philippine vessels, which it said had “illegally entered the waters adjacent to Ren’ai Reef,” as Beijing calls Second Thomas Shoal.\nEarlier in March, Chinese water cannon hit a Philippine resupply boat as it headed to Second Thomas Shoal, shattering windows and injuring four Filipino sailors.\nBeijing and Manila’s South China Sea disputes have heated up since the 2022 election of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who has taken a stronger line against China than his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte.\nThe clashes have also raised fears they could lead to a wider conflict, as Manila maintains a mutual defense treaty with the United States, which Washington says covers Philippine vessels in the disputed waterway.\n",

        "content": "The Group of Seven nations announced Tuesday its member nations would end the use of “unabated” coal by 2035, but left the door open for countries to stretch that deadline in particular contexts.\nIn a communiqué published after talks between energy, climate and environment ministers in Turin, Italy, the group announced it had committed to “phase out existing unabated coal power generation in our energy systems during the first half of 2030s,” in a climate policy breakthrough that G7 negotiators had previously failed to achieve in several years of talks.\nBut by referring to “unabated” coal, the agreement leaves room for countries to use the fossil fuel past 2035 if their carbon pollution is captured before entering the atmosphere.\nThe agreement also includes a caveat that countries could choose “a timeline consistent with keeping a limit of 1.5°C temperature rise within reach, in line with countries’ net-zero pathways.”\nThat caveat appears to allow those countries to keep using coal past 2035, as long as their overall national emissions won’t contribute to global warming of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Science shows that some of the planet’s ecosystems will reach tipping points or struggle to adapt beyond that point.\nSeveral members of the G7, which represents the biggest economies in the developed world, have already come close to ending the use of coal. Coal makes up less than 6% of the electricity mix in the UK, Italy and Canada, and almost nothing in France. But it still comprises 32% of Japan’s electricity mix, 27% of Germany’s and 16% of the US’, according to the think tank Ember.\nThe agreement comes just days after the US Environmental Protection Agency announced new rules that will require coal-fired power plants to either capture nearly all of their climate pollution or shut down by 2039. CNN has reached out to the White House and State Department for comment.\nWhen questioned by journalists on the caveats in the G7’s agreement, Italian Environment and Energy Security Minister Gilberto Pichetto Fratin defended the agreement, saying the language shows “G7 countries undertake to phase out the use of coal, without jeopardizing the various countries’ economic and social equilibrium.”\nThe language is weaker than what UK minister Andrew Bowie told a reporter on Monday: that the group had agreed to end coal by 2035, making no reference to unabated coal or wiggle room in the timeline.\nRelated article\nClimate change will make you poorer, according to a new report\nDespite the caveats, several climate policy experts welcomed the announcement, describing it as a breakthrough after years of roadblocks on the issue.\n“Stamping an end date on the coal era is precisely the kind of leadership we need from the world’s wealthiest countries,” said Jennifer Layke, the global director for energy at the World Resources Institute. “This decision provides a beacon of hope for the rest of the world, showing the transition away from coal can happen much faster than many thought possible.”\nBut the think tank Climate Analytics said that, while the announcement would put pressure on Japan, the only G7 member that hasn’t set an end date for coal, the 2035 deadline is too late to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees.\nAn analysis by the think tank shows all coal use in G7 nations needs to end by 2030 at the latest – and natural gas use should end by 2035 – to prevent global warming exceeding the 1.5-degree threshold.\nRelated article\nA plant that’s everywhere is fueling a growing risk of wildfire disaster\n“Many of these countries have already publicly committed to phase out dates ahead of 2030, and only have a small amount of coal capacity anyway,” said Jane Ellis, head of climate policy at Climate Analytics.\nIt’s notable that a gas phase-out was not mentioned, Ellis added. “In the last decade, gas has been the largest source of the global increase in CO2 emissions, and many G7 governments are investing in new domestic gas facilities. This is absolutely the wrong direction to be heading in – both economically and for the climate.”\nG7 should make the transition to renewables faster, Ellis said.\nFossil fuels are the primary driver of the climate crisis, and coal is typically the most polluting of all fossil fuels. But putting an end date on coal has been highly controversial. Japan has blocked progress on the issue at past G7 meetings, CNN has previously reported.\nAlmost every country in the world agreed last year to transition away from fossil fuels at the COP28 climate talks in Dubai, but failing to put an end date on coal was seen as a shortcoming of those negotiations.\nThe G7 typically leads on global climate policy. The group’s decisions often trickle down or influence the wider G20, which includes other big emitters, like China and India, as well as major fossil fuel producers, such as Saudi Arabia and Russia.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\nCNN’s Ella Nilsen and Laura Paddison contributed to this report.\n",

        "content": "A Palestinian writer who has been in an Israeli prison for 20 years has won a prestigious prize for Arabic fiction for his novel “A Mask, the Color of the Sky.”\nBasim Khandaqji won the prize on Sunday for his book, and was awarded $50,000 and funding for an English translation.\nThe “mask” of the book’s title is, metaphorically, a blue identity card belonging to an Israeli found by the protagonist, Nur, in the pocket of an old coat.\nNur, an archaeologist living in a refugee camp in Ramallah, adopts this “mask,” and “what follows is an experimental and multi-layered narrative which sets out to reclaim elements of history and place with vivid and memorable characterization,” said the International Prize for Arabic Fiction (IPAF), which announced the prizewinner at a ceremony Abu Dhabi.\nThe novel, published by Lebanon’s Dar Al-Adab, “dissects a complex, bitter reality of family fragmentation, displacement, genocide, and racism,” said Nabil Suleiman, a Syrian writer who chaired the 2024 prize.\n“The strands of history, myth, and the present day are delicately woven together in a narrative that pulses with compassion in the face of dehumanization and is stirred by a desire for freedom from oppression, both at an individual and societal level,” said Suleiman.\nBorn in Nablus in 1983, Khandaqji is serving three life sentences in connection with a deadly suicide bombing at Tel Aviv’s Camel Market in 2004, which killed three people and injured dozens, according to UAE state media, The National.\nHis brother, Yousef Khandaqji, attended the award ceremony at Abu Dhabi’s Fairmont Bab Al Bahr and said: “Speaking on behalf of my dear brother, he dedicates this victory to all the Palestinian people.”\n“I miss him every day and he is in our hearts every day,” he added.\nKhandaqji began to write “A Mask, the Color of the Sky” in 2021. The novel took six months to complete, while the research took several years.\nDuring his time in prison, Khandaqji has written poetry collections, as well as three earlier novels, according to IPAF.\n",

        "content": "The United Kingdom does not feed itself, relying heavily on the European Union for fresh fruit and vegetables. That dependency has changed little since Britain left the bloc in 2020, and could now mean more pain for consumers and small businesses.\nTuesday marks the beginning of the long-delayed introduction of post-Brexit physical inspections of plant and animal imports from the EU. The spot checks will apply initially to products such as meat, cheese and some fish, and eventually to a range of vegetables and fruit.\nHefty new charges on some imported food products will also come into effect, threatening to reduce consumer choice and push up prices not long after UK food inflation fell from double-digit rates. The measures coincide with dire warnings about the possibility of price rises for bread and beer because of the impact of unprecedented rainfall on British grain harvests.\nThe new regime for food imports is perhaps the starkest example of the painful border bureaucracy that UK and EU businesses must contend with in the wake of Brexit.\nBefore leaving the EU, Britain enjoyed unencumbered access to the vast array of food produced in neighboring countries: cheese from France, peaches from Spain, artichokes from Italy. A steady stream of EU agricultural workers, meanwhile, was a boon to British farmers.\nIn the post-Brexit world, Britain’s food supply is more vulnerable to external shocks, even as related labor shortages have at times forced local farmers to leave crops rotting because of a lack of workers to harvest them.\nRelated article\nLast-minute Brexit bill risks higher food prices, UK business groups warn\nUK industry groups say the additional red tape could mean thousands of pounds in extra costs each month for a typical business, while hold-ups at the border will reduce the shelf-life of perishable products and increase food waste.\nEddie Price, the director of the Birmingham Wholesale Market, which houses around 50 businesses selling meat, vegetables, fish, and flowers, says traders are worried about higher costs and delays at the border.\n“There are concerns that (the food) will probably get held up at the point of entry for a couple of days and potentially reduce the value of the product and make it less available,” he told CNN. “There is a real concern, particularly among the larger importers, that it could add several percentage points to their costs.”\nThe UK government insists the new controls are crucial to ensure biosecurity and that checks will be phased in “in a sensible and controlled way,” with the focus initially on the “highest-risk goods,” a category that includes live animals.\n“It is important to remember the cost of our border checks is negligible compared to the impact of a major disease outbreak on our economy and farmers,” a government spokesperson said earlier this month.\nThe government estimates the new checks will cost British businesses about £330 million ($419 million) annually and increase food inflation by about 0.2 percentage points over three years.\nBut the Cold Chain Federation, which represents businesses delivering goods that need chilled storage, has come up with a much larger sum. It calculates that the new border measures could easily add more than £1 billion ($1.3 billion) a year in costs to firms trading perishable produce, even before fruit and vegetables, which are likely to face fewer checks, are included.\nAn additional cost of that scale will “significantly increase food prices and reduce choice,” the federation’s CEO Phil Pluck wrote in a letter to environment and food minister Steve Barclay earlier this month.\n“We also believe that this will seriously threaten the viability of small and medium-sized enterprises operating within food retail, such as small garden centres, restaurants, and delicatessens,” he added.\nThe British Retail Consortium, which represents major supermarkets among other retailers, is less concerned about the potential impact on food prices. Any additional cost from new checks and paperwork is “likely to be small relative to the £200 billion of food sales in the UK each year, meaning it is unlikely to result in any large price rises,” according to the organization’s director of food and sustainability Andrew Opie.\n“However, it is vital that border checks run smoothly when they are introduced in April to avoid any risk of delays or availability issues,” he cautioned in a statement.\nIt won’t help that trucks arriving from the EU through the Port of Dover and the undersea Eurotunnel, which handle the majority of UK food imports, will be directed 22 miles (35 kilometers) inland for physical checks at a different facility.\nAround half of the food on British plates is imported, mainly from the EU ﻿— the Netherlands, France, Ireland and Germany are the biggest suppliers. Warmer Italy and Spain are also essential providers of fresh produce, particularly as UK shoppers are used to being able to buy virtually any type of food all year found.\nIn 2022, almost 40% of fresh vegetables consumed in the UK came from the EU, according to official figures. Some 53% was produced locally and the rest was imported from other countries.\nWhen it comes to fruit, only 16% is produced domestically, with 28% sourced from the EU and 56% from the rest of the world.\nThis heavy reliance on food from other countries was thrown into the spotlight in February last year, when poor weather in Spain and North Africa caused shortages in Britain, leading supermarkets to impose purchase limits on some staple items, including tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers.\nIn an article in Nature published in June 2020, academics from the University of York in England argued that Britain is “dangerously dependent” on the Netherlands and Spain for the “lion’s share” of its fresh vegetable imports. “The degree to which this dependence can be sustained after Brexit is a moot point, to say the least,” they wrote.\nBut Jack Bobo, director of the Food Systems Institute at the University of Nottingham in England, says a reliance on imports doesn’t make a food system inherently more vulnerable. “There are risks either way,” he told CNN, pointing to disease outbreaks or extreme weather events that could wipe out local production.\n“The Netherlands, Ireland, Germany and France… those are all major global food exporters,” he added. “It’s still going to be easier to ship to the UK than it is to any other global market.”\nPrice at the Birmingham Wholesale Market says the new border charges give local suppliers the chance to offer more competitive prices than their EU counterparts. “This is hopefully an opportunity for the UK farmers,” he added.\nThe UK already uses about 70% of its land for agriculture, well above major EU agricultural producers, according to World Bank data. Still, experts say the country has scope to grow more of its own fresh produce, including apples, pears, tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers.\nBut here too Brexit hasn’t helped, ending as it did the free movement of EU workers on whom British farmers had relied for decades.\nSeasonal worker visas were temporarily introduced to address this issue, allowing agricultural workers from the EU and elsewhere to work on UK farms for short periods. But with the program set to expire at the end of this year, many farmers are filled with trepidation over what comes next.\n“No agricultural business knows whether they will have seasonal workers for 2025. That is rapidly approaching a crisis,” Tom Bradshaw, president of the National Farmers’ Union (NFU), told CNN. “You’re not going to invest in production for the long term if you don’t know about access to your workforce.”\nBrexit has also spurred the UK government to agree free trade deals with Australia and New Zealand, handing countries with much larger and more cost-effective agricultural industries tariff-free access to British supermarket shelves.\n“Since the 2016 referendum our political system has been in complete turmoil. Farming has been sold down the line and used as a bargaining chip in trade talks,” Philip Maddocks, the CEO of PDM Produce, a salad grower in the English county of Shropshire, said at a recent NFU Conference.\nIn addition to Brexit-related challenges, UK farmers have been squeezed by soaring input costs, including those of fertilizer, energy and labor. Supermarkets, a handful of which wield enormous power in Britain’s food supply chain, have often been unwilling to pay local producers more, opting instead for imports to keep their prices low.\nIn December, the government launched a review to “increase fairness” in the supply chain for fresh produce, which will probe contractual arrangements between UK producers and retailers.\n“I’m not hugely in favor of subsidies, I’m in favor of fair food prices,” Maddocks said. “The government needs a strategy for food… that looks out at the next 20 years, not five or one, or even months, as has been the case in the past few years.”\n",

CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy.\nWhen it comes to airport expansion projects, the Gulf States are abuzz and the competition is fierce.\nA mammoth airport in Saudi Arabia has already set records for size, but new plans in Dubai are ratcheting up the race to be the world’s busiest airport by passenger volume.\nSaudi Arabia’s King Fahd International Airport currently wears the crown as the largest airport in the world by area. At a whopping 780 square kilometers (about 300 square miles), that’s bigger than neighboring country Bahrain.\nThe Saudis aren’t resting on their laurels, either. The country is working on a new six-runway airport on the King Fahd International site by 2030, with capacity eventually for 185 million passengers per year.\nFor comparison, that’s 75 million more than the 110 million passengers the world’s current busiest airport by passenger volume, Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International, is expected to serve this year.\nAnd this is by no means Hartsfield-Jackson’s first time at the rodeo. It’s held that position every year — except for pandemic-hit 2020 — for more than two decades.\nDubai, however, just made a huge play, laying out plans Sunday for a new $34.85 billion (AED 128 billion) passenger terminal at Dubai World Central - Al Maktoum International (DWC), the emirate’s newest airport.\nThe stakes just reached a new level.\nRelated article\nThe world’s best airports for 2024, according to Skytrax\nSince DWC - Al Maktoum International opened 14 years ago, it was always planned for this brand new airport some 20 miles southwest of downtown Dubai to become the biggest passenger-handler in the world.\nHowever, now the plan is for the megahub to eventually accommodate 260 million passengers per year. That’s a full 100 million passengers more than previous projections for the airport and would dwarf pretty much every other airport’s operations on the planet.\n“It will be five times the size of the current Dubai International Airport, and all operations at Dubai International Airport will be transferred to it in the coming years,” Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, said Sunday when outlining Dubai Aviation Engineering Projects’ strategic plan. “The airport will accommodate 400 aircraft gates and feature five parallel runways,” he added.\nDubai World Central is the newer of two international airports in Dubai. The other, Dubai International Airport, was just ranked the No. 2 busiest airport in the world, but its traffic will eventually go to the newer airport, according to DWC’s expansion plans.\nThe airport will be the centerpiece of a much larger scheme, called Dubai South, that envisages the creation of a whole new city in a 145-square-kilometer (56-square-mile) stretch of desert just south of Dubai.\nThis entire new district, of which some pieces are already starting to take shape, will have eight neighborhoods each allocated to a specific industry or activity, with a mix of residential and commercial areas as well.\n“As we build an entire city around the airport in Dubai South, demand for housing for a million people will follow. It will host the world’s leading companies in the logistics and air transport sectors,” said Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.\n“We are building a new project for future generations, ensuring continuous and stable development for our children and their children in turn. Dubai will be the world’s airport, its port, its urban hub, and its new global center.”\nWhen completed, it’ll cover a very generous 70 square kilometers (27 square miles) – although that’s still less than a tenth of the land area of Saudi Arabia’s King Fahd International. Saudi Arabia will be holding onto that world record for a while yet.\nRelated article\nDubai airport struggles to resume flights after heavy rains leave runways underwater\nAt present, Dubai World Central’s primary role is as a center for aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul – “MRO” in industry parlance. It also hosts a number of air cargo operators (including Emirates Cargo, the freight subsidiary of the UAE flag carrier) and handles executive jets and some charter flights. Those cargo operations will ultimately handle up to 12 million tonnes per annum, according to the new plans.\nAs for the timeline, well, take note of the Sheikh’s words about “our children and their children.”\nThe plan is for the first phase to be ready within 10 years, with capacity increased to 150 million passengers annually. Beyond that, we’re looking at a decades-long time frame.\n“The new airport will prepare the ground for the next 40 years of anticipated growth in Dubai’s aviation sector,” said Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.\nOn Sunday, flag-carrier Emirates took to X to announce its long-awaited relocation to its “future home” at Dubai World Central - Al Maktoum International.\nIn the meantime, though, it’s business as usual at Dubai International (DXB), which earned its No.2 busiest airport in the world title this month for the very first time, serving 104.7 passengers in 2023.\nPaul Griffiths, CEO of Dubai Airports, confirmed in a statement Sunday that “DXB will continue to serve as the primary hub […] over the next few years as phase two of DWC takes shape.”\nKeep an eye too on Hamad International Airport in nearby Qatar, a direct competitor of Dubai in the long-haul connectivity market, which is gearing up to expand its capacity to more than 60 million annual passengers.\nThis adds to other airport expansion projects in the region: the opening of a $1.8 billion brand new airport in Muscat, Oman, in 2018, the $1.1 billion new terminal in Bahrain in 2021 and, more recently, in November 2023, of Abu Dhabi’s grand new Terminal A, a 780,000-square-meter facility able to handle up to 79 aircraft simultaneously.\nAt the northern end of the Gulf, Kuwait International Airport is building a new terminal designed by renowned British architectural firm Foster+Partners, which will have the capacity to handle 25 million passengers per year initially, with the possibility of doubling it up to 50 million in the future.\nAnd less than 20 miles from Dubai’s downtown, Sharjah International Airport, which is primarily home to low-cost carrier Air Arabia, is also increasing its capacity to 20 million passengers annually.\n",

        "content": "When the e-scooter company Matt Gialich used to work for had to pause production owing to a shortage of platinum, a key component for the microprocessor that translates commands from the controls to the motor, he went down a rabbit hole researching metals.\nGialich, whose childhood love of space led him into engineering and a job at the satellite launch company Virgin Orbit before its bankruptcy, began wondering how to extract the metal in asteroids. Scientists believe these chunks of celestial debris, which are by-products from the birth of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago, are rich in metals that are in short supply on Earth.\nIn 2022, Gialich and Jose Acain, who has almost a decade of experience at SpaceX and NASA, founded AstroForge. Now the California-based startup is attempting to make asteroid mining a reality.\nThe company isn’t alone. The clean energy transition is expected to cause demand for mineral resources to soar, and interest in extracting them from previously untapped sources, like the ocean floor and space, is growing. Companies across the world have raised tens of millions of dollars to test asteroid-mining technologies.\nSome say the idea is a prohibitively expensive, far-fetched fantasy. But 38-year-old Gialich thinks it could be put into practice soon. “Going out and securing resources from space is this Holy Grail,” he says. “I think we’re finally at this inflection point where we can take it on.”\nGialich has no problem admitting that his company’s plans are ambitious. “We’re going to have a lot of failures,” he says.\nAstroForge is, in short, attempting to send into space a tiny refinery that can extract minerals out of an asteroid, then bring the valuable metals back to Earth, leaving the rest. The company is targeting M-type, or metallic, asteroids for platinum group metals (PGMs), which are used in everything from jewelry to catalytic converters that filter car exhaust to cancer-fighting drugs.\nPGMs like platinum and iridium are also critical raw materials for emerging clean energy technologies. Green hydrogen production, for example, is expected to drive major growth in demand for the minerals. But earthly supplies are limited and geographically concentrated.\nAlthough it sounds like a plot straight from the latest season of the Apple TV+ show “For All Mankind,” which involved an elaborate plan to harness an asteroid and bring it into Earth’s orbit for mining, Gialich says “that’s not what we’re doing at all.”\nLast April, AstroForge launched its inaugural mission, called Brokkr-1, sending a miniature satellite equipped with a refinery system about the size of two loaves of bread into space. The spacecraft carried pre-loaded, asteroid-like material it planned to vaporize and sort into elemental components while in orbit.\nRelated article\nThis ‘GigaFarm’ in the desert could produce 3 million kilograms of food\nIt hasn’t gone quite as planned, and the refinery demonstration hasn’t happened yet. But Gialich says the company learned a lot, like how any equipment sourced from vendors would perform, and if the machine could survive blastoff and send signals back from space.\nThe refinery – which AstroForge has patents on – has already been tested terrestrially in space-like conditions, he says. That makes AstroForge the only company with a refinery that can turn M-type asteroids into PGMs in space, he adds.\nThis year, an AstroForge spacecraft will hitch a ride on a mission by US-space exploration company Intuitive Machines to the Moon. But AstroForge will jump ship and use its own propulsion system to fly by an asteroid it thinks is metallic to check out its composition and take pictures. (Gialich declined to specify which asteroid the company is targeting.) If this mission succeeds, it will make AstroForge the first commercial company to venture into deep space, it says. It could also provide the first high resolution images of a metallic asteroid.\nInterest in asteroids – both for better understanding Earth’s origins and their composition, which could lay the groundwork for miners – is skyrocketing, and experts say asteroid mining may just be a matter of time.\nDan Britt, the director of the Center for Lunar and Asteroid Surface Science at the University of Central Florida, who is not directly involved with AstroForge, ponders: “I suppose you could ask whether [humans] are totally crazy to do this. The answer is, it might be a bit early, but we’re not totally crazy.”\nThe likes of JAXA, Japan’s space agency, and NASA have already brought asteroid samples back to Earth, proving, at least to an extent, that it can be done.\nChina plans to launch a mission in 2025 to collect samples from a near-Earth asteroid, while the United Arab Emirates’ Space Agency is planning to explore the asteroid belt with a mission scheduled to launch in 2028.\nNASA has a spacecraft en route to asteroid Psyche, which is orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter, but it won’t get there until 2029. By some estimates, the iron in the 140-mile-wide metal-rich asteroid is worth $10,000 quadrillion – more than the value of the entire global economy. (Gialich says that NASA scientists have been excellent allies, providing invaluable expertise to AstroForge.)\nSome in the scientific community are skeptical that the private sector will be able to afford asteroid mining. NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission, the first US mission to collect an asteroid sample and bring it back to Earth, cost hundreds of millions of dollars, excluding launch cost. Its return of just 122 grams, which landed in a Utah desert last year, is the largest asteroid sample ever collected.\nRelated article\nJetZero: Groundbreaking ‘blended-wing’ demonstrator plane cleared to fly\n“This actually is not a question of if it can be done from a physics standpoint,” says Gialich. “It’s a question of can you do it so it makes any monetary sense.”\nOthers have tried and failed. Planetary Resources, for example, launched in 2012 with the backing of high-profile investors including “Titanic” director James Cameron and Google co-founder Larry Page. By 2020, it was holding an online fire sale after facing funding difficulties and being acquired by a blockchain firm. (Buyers in the Internet auction scored items like a plastic tub full of assorted, tangled electrical cords for $10 and a pair of well-used insulated gloves for $20.)\nA lot has also changed. Private companies like SpaceX have dramatically decreased the cost of space travel. Gialich says today more is known about the solar system’s 1.3 million asteroids, so companies like his don’t have to waste resources looking for them, and that AstroForge has invested in developing algorithms that allow it to rideshare and get where it’s trying to go.\n“Lower transportation costs are key to developing an off-world economy,” says Britt, who has contributed to four NASA missions, including a flyby of an asteroid in the Kuiper Belt, a donut-shaped ring of debris at the edge of the solar system, and a series of journeys to asteroids near Jupiter, and has an asteroid named after him for his contributions to asteroid research.\nThe changes have driven a wave of new interest. Other companies, like Los Angeles-headquartered TransAstra and China-based Origin Space, are working on technologies that can mine resources in space.\nSo far, AstroForge has raised $13 million in seed funding. It says its second mission will cost less than $10 million, which means the company will be putting most of its eggs in one basket. “These are high-risk, high-reward ventures, to be very clear,” says Gialich.\nHe doesn’t yet have a plan B if the planned missions aren’t successful. “Who cares? You go out and you try these big missions, these big gambles, and if it doesn’t work, I don’t know. I guess I go get a job somewhere?” he says. “I’m just focused on plan A and trying to make that happen.”\nIf all goes well, the company’s eventual aim is to bring back about 1,000 kilograms (2,200 pounds) of PGMs per mission, a payload which could be worth around $70 million, depending on the metals and their price at the time. “Even with multiple hiccups in our schedule, we are attempting to mine an asteroid and we’ll have brought it back before the end of this decade,” Gialich says.\nBecause the company is targeting relatively smaller asteroids, it says there will be less gravity to overcome, and therefore less fuel to burn.\nIts all-or-nothing, lower-cost approach may help push asteroid mining closer to reality.\n“Even if we’re not successful and we fail as a company, I hope that we push this forward a little bit,” he says, and demonstrate that “you can do a lot more science with a lot less capital.”\nBritt says asteroid mining is likely to “happen eventually” and the technology in the market is already a lot more advanced than “a soggy bar napkin with a bunch of equations and diagrams drawn on it.”\nBut he expects that technologies will need to advance even further before investors are willing to put big chunks of capital behind it.\n“That’s one of the things that startups like AstroForge are doing – creating that new technology and engineering,” Britt says.\nIt may be years before we know if AstroForge’s attempts have a lasting impact on the wider push to extract minerals from space. But its moonshot approach is likely to be remembered. “I hope if nothing else,” Gialich says, “we’re known as a space company that went for it.”\n",

        "content": "Around 47 children vanish every day in Europe, according to new research by cross-border journalism collective Lost in Europe showing more than 50,000 child migrants went missing after arrival over the past three years.\nData requested from 31 European countries, including Austria, Germany, and Italy, show at least 51,433 unaccompanied refugee minors were registered as missing between 2021 and the end of 2023. The actual figure could be higher due to inadequate documentation of cases, with some countries not collecting data on such children at all.\nThe research builds on findings released in 2021 that revealed at least 18,000 child migrants disappeared upon arrival in Europe in the three years from January 2018 to December 2020.\nAagje Ieven, secretary general for Missing Children Europe, a federation bringing together grassroots organizations across the continent, said the increased number of reported cases revealed by the research serves as a sharp reminder of the many instances  yet to be uncovered.\n“More of the iceberg is becoming visible, and that is a positive evolution,” she said, comparing the unreported cases to the bulk of the ice below the water’s surface. Out of 31 contacted countries, Lost in Europe received 20 responses, with seven lacking required data and 11 not responding — representing an improvement from 12 responses overall in 2021. Lost in Europe was able to find the data needed for two of the countries that did not respond, Italy and Slovakia, in official reports.\nItaly and Austria lead in registrations of missing unaccompanied minors, with 22,899 and 20,077 cases respectively, followed by Belgium, Germany and Switzerland with between roughly 2,200 and 1,200 reported cases.\nHowever, higher numbers in Italy and Austria do not necessarily indicate more cases, but that more efficient data collection systems are in place, Ieven said. ” We need to get all of the countries to more diligently report,” she told CNN, since children can be better protected if they are in the system.\nThe fate of missing unaccompanied migrant children is worrying, Ieven said. “They are at a higher risk of being targeted by traffickers, if not already exploited by smugglers to pay off debts, or because they hold control over their loved ones or their passports.”\nMultiple factors contribute to the disappearance of migrant children. There are concerns that some may have fallen prey to human traffickers or been subjected to exploitation in the sex industry. Others disappear voluntarily because they do not trust the authorities or to escape unsafe reception conditions.\nMany move to other countries to reunite with relatives or friends without registering it, Ieven said.\nIeven pointed out that the scarcity of opportunities for minors makes them vulnerable to exploitation, alongside the numerous traumas they endure prior to reaching Europe. A 2022 Ghent University study found that 84% of children experienced physical violence during their migration to Europe, with over 90% witnessing it.\nChildren make up around 40% of the world’s displaced people, according to the United Nations. While fleeing wars and conflicts, thousands of children find themselves separated from their families and relatives, and others travel alone, sent ahead by parents seeking to ensure their survival.\nAfghanistan was the country of origin for at least one in three unaccompanied minors who went missing in Europe between 2021 and 2023. The number of Afghan children arriving there increased following the Taliban takeover of power in August 2021.\nOther significant countries of origin include Syria, Tunisia, Egypt, and Morocco, according to the data collected by Lost in Europe.\nPatricia Durr, chief executive of ECPAT UK, a children’s rights organization, emphasized in comments to Lost in Europe that the situation represents a crisis in child protection, “exacerbated by punitive border policies and the lack of safe and legal routes for children in Europe to move between member states safely.”\nAn Austrian Ministry of the Interior spokesperson noted that the substantial influx of asylum applications from unaccompanied minor refugees presents specific challenges regarding legal representation and reception, Lost in Europe said.\nAs outlined in a 2020 report by the European Union-funded European Migration Network, most EU member states are mandated to report and register missing children within 24 hours, yet, as Ieven highlighted to CNN, this requirement is often not met.\nPatricia Durr raised further concerns about the impact that the EU’s new Pact on Migration and Asylum, approved by the European Parliament in April 2024, will have on children on the move. “Measures such as including children within detention for screening purposes is a clear breach of their rights under international law and will increase their vulnerability to going missing, abuse and trafficking,” she said.\nAccording to Ieven, registering migrant children and acknowledging their rights, including access to education, is crucial for their safety. “What will keep them safe is understanding that there is a future for them in the system, rather than outside of it,” she said.\nLost in Europe is a not-for-profit cross-border journalism project investigating the disappearance of child migrants in Europe.\n",

        "content": "Hong Kong — HSBC has announced its chief executive Noel Quinn will retire — a surprise departure by its hard-nosed leader of five years who has overseen a sweeping series of asset sales across the globe.\nThe Asia-focused bank said in a statement Tuesday that it had launched a formal process to find a successor.\nChief financial officer Georges Elhedery, appointed to the No. 2 role in January 2023, is likely the leading internal candidate for the job.\nQuinn, 62, has restored momentum to the bank’s profits and share price by getting rid of or slashing in size underperforming businesses, including the lender’s retail banking businesses in the United States and France, its entire Canadian subsidiary and units in smaller markets such as Argentina.\nHSBC’s (HSBC) shares, which have gained roughly 30% during his tenure, rose about 1.3% and touched a nine-month high in the afternoon session in Hong Kong.\n“I think shrinking businesses in Western markets such as the US, Canada and Europe has been a good move for HSBC at the same time as boosting the group’s Asian business,” said Simon Yuen, founder of Hong Kong-based Surich Asset Management, which is an HSBC shareholder.\n“We do hope that the next CEO would lay out more plans, execution-wise, to further increase the bank’s businesses in Asian countries,” he added.\nQuinn will remain CEO until his successor starts in the role.\n“I’ve held intensive leadership roles since I took on a commercial bank role in October 2008, so I’m personally ready for a change,” Quinn told reporters on a call.\n“It’s also a natural inflection point for the bank, as it comes to the end of the current transformation phase. It’s an ideal time to bring in leadership to move the bank forward over the next five years.”\nHSBC Chairman Mark Tucker said the bank was aiming to complete Quinn’s succession process by second half of this year.\n“He (Quinn) first informed me of this earlier this month,” Tucker said of the timing of Quinn’s decision to step down, adding that the decision was Quinn’s own and that the board supported it.\nQuinn, who joined HSBC in 1987, was named the chief executive of the bank, which makes most of its revenues and profits in Asia, in March 2020, after serving as an interim CEO following the surprise ouster of his predecessor.\nHe played a crucial role in navigating challenges during and after the coronavirus pandemic, as well as heightened geopolitical tensions that weighed on the bank’s key market, China.\nHe also won a major showdown with the bank’s No. 1 Asian investor, China’s Ping An Insurance, which ran a multi-year campaign to try and get HSBC to spin off its Asia business, which ended in defeat at the bank’s shareholder meeting last year.\nHSBC also faced criticism in recent years from Western lawmakers over its dealings with China amid growing geopolitical tensions. Hong Kong is HSBC’s single largest market globally.\nHSBC reported pretax profit of $12.7 billion, slightly ahead of forecasts, for the quarter ended March versus $12.9 billion a year earlier, as it struggles to cope with rising costs from expansion in Asia.\nThe London-headquartered bank also announced $3 billion worth of share buybacks on top of $2 billion in share purchases announced in February.\n",

        "content": "In the Los Angeles restaurant where Nathaly Paola Castro Torres works, customers never fail to comment on her short stature.\n“People stare at me too much and make comments or jokes,” Torres, 42, said. “Many times they also (take) photos of me and I don’t like it. I feel very bad.”\nAt 4 feet, 2 inches tall (127 centimeters), Torres is a “little person” who isn’t used to such reactions. While she was growing up in Quito, Ecuador, people seldom mentioned her height. She worked at a car dealership, felt embraced by her community, and considered her size an advantage.\n“Since I was a teenager, I saw my height as (an opportunity) to develop — the growth problem is part of my personality,” Torres told CNN in Spanish.\n“I am also quite lucky because in reality my body protects me a lot from diseases that other people have every day,” she added. “This height, at the same time as being a limitation, is also a blessing.”\nTorres has a rare disorder called Laron syndrome that is caused by a genetic mutation. It stunts her growth but also provides a hidden silver lining: Her body is protected from chronic diseases such as cancer that often take life away long before old age.\n“I wonder what people who make fun of Nathaly would say if they knew she lived in a body that may some day provide information on how to live longer, disease-free lives,” said Valter Longo, professor of gerontology and biological sciences at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.\n“We have shown in studies people with Laron have a very low incidence of cancer, diabetes and cognitive decline,” said Longo, who has studied Laron syndrome for nearly 20 years. “Brain scans have shown they have more youthful brains — the equivalent of someone 20 years younger. I have yet to see a case of Alzheimer’s in this population.”\nRelated article\nExercise changes the brain in a way that helps heart health, especially for people with depression\nAnd according to a new study published Friday in the journal Med, Torres and other people who have the condition may also be protected from heart disease, Longo said.\n“It doesn’t mean that they are immune to these diseases, but people with Laron syndrome certainly seem to be very protected,” added Longo, who was a coauthor of the latest research. “This is how powerful this mutation seems to be.”\nThe first cases of little people who seemed to shrug off disease were identified in Israel in 1958 among children of Jewish immigrants from Yemen and other parts of the Middle East. Today, there may be between 350 and 500 people with Laron syndrome in the United States, Ecuador, Israel, Croatia, Ireland and other European countries, Longo said.\nIn 1987, Dr. Jaime Guevara-Aguirre, then a young physician just starting his career, discovered a group of about 100 people with Laron syndrome scattered across rural towns in Ecuador. Guevara-Aguirre, who was first author of the new report, is the founder of the Institute of Endocrinology, Metabolism, and Reproduction in Quito.\nThese people all carried a mutation in their human growth hormone receptor gene, according to Guevara-Aguirre’s research. That genetic disruption blocks the body’s ability to use insulin-like growth factor, or IGF-1, a hormone created primarily in the liver. Growth hormone and IGF-1 work together to promote normal bone and tissue growth, so a deficit stunts growth.\nPeople with Laron have IGF-1 in their tissues, where it can be called upon to help heal wounds and other body processes. However, unlike the rest of us, these folks have little of the hormone circulating in their bloodstream, where it wreaks  havoc and contributes to aging.\nFortunately, the lack of circulating IGF-1 also blocks the uncontrolled growth of cancer cells and creates an extra sensitivity to insulin that protects against diabetes.\nIn 2005, Guevara-Aguirre reached out to Longo, who had been studying a similar mutation in yeast cells that extended their existence.\n“In addition to yeast cells, worms, flies and mice with similar mutations all live extraordinarily long lives,” Longo said. “Mice with the same mutation we are studying in humans hold the record in longevity — they live 40% longer than mice without it, and 50% of those mice never develop any pathology. So they are living longer and healthier lives.”\nThe two began to collaborate, hoping they might identify a drug that could potentially be used to lower circulating IGF-1 in the general population and provide antiaging and disease-preventive benefits, Longo said.\n“The idea would be for people who have high circulating IGF-1 levels to get drugs that lower the IGF-1 back to the range that seems to be associated with the lowest mortality rate, much like people take a drug for high cholesterol,” Longo said.\nA Western diet packed with protein and sugar also increases circulating levels of IGF-1, thus hastening aging, Longo said.\n“There are IGF-1 lowering diets, such as fasting for five days a month, which is called a fasting-mimicking diet,” he said. “We have published studies which found circulating IGF-1 levels remained depressed for a while after doing this.”\nRelated article\nSmoking may lead to more belly fat, a new study suggests. Here’s why that’s concerning\nGuevara-Aguirre and Longo are also looking for funding to provide IGF-1-boosting injections to children in Ecuador born with Laron syndrome. Given during childhood to encourage height, the drugs could then be stopped to allow the mutation’s genetic protection against disease to take over.\n“So far, the (Ecuadorian) government and pharmaceutical companies will not pay for it,” Longo said. “We are having to do it more slowly with diet, and we have had a bit of success.”\nThere are health risks connected to Laron syndrome as well. The condition leads to extreme obesity, a trigger for diabetes, heart disease, cancer and other diseases. In addition, many of the people Longo studies “never exercise” and often drink, smoke and reside in disadvantaged communities without adequate health care, he said.\nInstead of dying from chronic diseases connected to obesity, however, there is an unusually high rate of alcohol- and accident-related deaths as well as convulsive disorders among the Laron population, he said.\nAnd because low levels of IGF-1 in those without the mutation have been linked in studies with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, “everybody assumed that people with Laron probably had a lot of heart and cardiovascular problems, too, especially considering their obesity,” he added.\nTo find out, Longo and Guevara-Aguirre examined Torres and 23 others with Laron syndrome and compared them with 27 of their first-degree relatives without the condition, most of whom live in Ecuador.\nRelated article\nA daily step goal may cut disease and death risk in even otherwise sedentary people, study finds\n“We found people with Laron certainly do not have an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease despite the fact that they are often obese and live in poor environments, and some markers of cardiovascular disease were even improved,” Longo said.\nPeople with Laron in the study had better insulin sensitivity, lower blood pressure and no heart rhythm disturbances — all positive outcomes, he said.\nIn addition, people with Laron syndrome had plaque deposits in their arteries of only 7% despite having high cholesterol, which typically leads to clogging of the arteries and a higher risk of heart attacks, stroke and other heart diseases.\nThe control group of first-degree relatives, who shared the same diet and lifestyle, had plaque deposits of 30%, Longo said.\nHowever, additional signs of cardiovascular wear and tear were absent from the study, leaving some questions unanswered, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver.\n“Still, I think it’s an interesting and promising study,” said Freeman, who was not involved in the research. “It lays the groundwork to see what we learn from this to reduce harms that affect people as they age.”\nTorres recently went to the doctor for a checkup. While technically overweight at 100 pounds (45.4 kilograms), she was in good health, with no signs of diabetes or heart disease.\n“(The doctor) tells me, ‘If you want, you can lose weight, but it’s not a health problem for you, you’re perfect,’” Torres said. “I feel very fortunate and find the response of my body to these other more serious diseases very interesting.”\nRelated article\nThis diet with exercise reduces dangerous belly fat and more, study says\nShe plans to stay in the United States to take advantage of educational opportunities and to see whether she “can get a chance for a better job, a career.” However, she said she misses her family and the ease of purchasing fresh fruits and vegetables abundant in Ecuador.\n“I learned is that even though my body is a little more adaptable, I still have to be careful with my diet,” she said. “Because although it is true that we have a health advantage over other people, we do not know for sure to what extent this will protect us.”\nShe also said she’s proud of her role in the research on Laron syndrome.\n“The objective is to be able to develop some medical help in order to help the rest of the people who struggle with diabetes and cancer, two of the most catastrophic diseases,” she said. “This is my hope.”\n",

        "content": "A step onto the podium. A medal draped over your head and a flag raised in your honor. Music. Tears of joy and relief as years of hard work come to fruition.\nReceiving a first Olympic medal is supposed to be a momentous and exhilarating occasion for every athlete but not Alysia Montaño.\nIt was late at night in Cleveland this year when the American athlete was informed that her fourth-place finish at the 2012 Olympics is set to be upgraded to bronze. Alone in a hotel room, thousands of miles from home, her initial emotions were only emptiness and loss.\nThis should have come 12 years earlier, in a packed stadium with her family sitting proudly in the stands. Instead, all Montaño could do was lie down and stare vacantly at the ceiling as the hours drifted by.\n“A stab in the gut, in the heart, really,” is how she describes her supposed moment of triumph. “I kind of felt a sinking feeling, to be honest.”\nMontaño initially placed fifth in the women’s 800-meter final in London, about half a second outside the medal positions having led the race bravely through the first lap.\nIn front of her were two Russian athletes – Mariya Savinova, who had streaked away from the rest of the field on the final straight, and Ekaterina Guliyev (then known as Ekaterina Poistogova), who narrowly edged out Kenya’s Pamela Jelimo for bronze.\nBoth Savinova and Guliyev were identified in a 2015 report, commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), as having benefitted from Russia’s state-sponsored doping program, though Montaño’s performance at the London Olympics is only just now receiving the recognition it deserves.\nSavinova was stripped of her gold medal in 2017, while Guliyev is also set to lose her silver, upgraded from bronze, after the Athletics Integrity Unit announced this month that her results from July 17, 2012 to October 20, 2014 would be disqualified.\nGuliyev, now competing for Turkey under her husband’s surname, has been given a two-year ban and has until May 13 to appeal the decision.\nShe has previously served another two-year ban for doping violations, voiding her results back to October 2015, and attempted to argue in a tribunal that there was no evidence to bring further charges against her. CNN has contacted the Turkish Athletic Federation for further comment.\nIn the days after learning that she could be awarded a bronze medal, Montaño says that her emotions oscillated from joy to sadness to something akin to grief.\nHer despair is at its lowest when she thinks of her grandmother, who turned 100 days before the 800-meter final in London and celebrated by watching the race from a hospital bed, never to know that Montaño’s fifth place would later be upgraded.\n“You can’t ever get that back,” the 38-year-old Montaño explains. “The loss is history lost; the loss is the moment lost; the loss is the people who were there to hug you and cheer for you; the loss is the homecoming parade. These things are very real.”\nThis is not a new situation for Montaño, who was retrospectively awarded bronze medals for her performances at the 2011 and 2013 world championships after Savinova was stripped of gold in both races.\nWhile competing, she says that she was suspicious of her Russian rivals, partly after observing a sharp and unprecedented improvement in some athletes’ results and partly from the ease with which they would pass her on the track.\n“It’s like you’re running against robots,” says Montaño. “When you get beaten by a competitor, you can feel the huff and the puff of the two of you kind of going at it, or the three of you going at it.\n“Sticking your neck out there for just a second of time, or a millisecond of time, and it just isn’t the same way. Anybody can go and watch those videos [of past races] and see: this is wild.”\nIn 2019, six and eight years after winning her two world championship medals, Montaño and her family – her husband, parents and children – were invited to Doha in Qatar for a staging of the medal ceremonies she never had.\nBut the crowd in the stadium was scant and the accompanying fireworks display, she thought, was underwhelming, making her feel “even more empty.”\nNow, Montaño hopes to receive her Olympic medal at the 2028 Games in Los Angeles, with family, friends, supporters and sponsors there to see the moment – unlike American shot putter Adam Nelson, who was handed his gold medal next to a Burger King, nine years later than intended due to a rival’s doping violation.\nShe also wants to recoup some of the financial losses she incurred by being denied an Olympic medal, and one of her current sponsors, Clif Bar, has already agreed to pay Montaño an undisclosed financial bonus for finishing third in 2012, even though she partnered with the company after the London Olympics.\nBased on the contracts she had at the time, Montaño estimates that she has missed out on payments amounting to “well over seven figures.”\nHowever, the true sum is impossible to quantify; winning a medal at a major championship, she explains, increases an athlete’s potential earnings when it comes to negotiating appearance fees or future contracts.\n“Even now, I walk into a conversation and folks run through your accolades and you know the difference between being a medalist and not being one is a huge pay cut,” says Montaño.\n“It’s like anybody who walks into a job interview and their experience gets them a difference with what their compensation is going to be. Coming off [the 2011 world championships] and being a bronze medalist, my bargaining power would have been through the roof,” she added.\nShe believes that some athletes competing at this year’s Paris Olympics will end up suffering a similar fate to her – potentially being robbed of their moment on the podium and in the spotlight – and wants to see harsher punishments introduced for those found guilty of doping offenses.\n“We need to have a much more difficult pathway for athletes who use performance-enhancing drugs to re-enter the sport,” says Montaño.\n“We also have to have much heavier repercussions, I think, from a financial aspect for athletes who choose to dope … There needs to be heavy fines, especially if you want to re-enter the sport. And right now, there’s not enough repercussion.”\nRelated article\nChinese swimmers head to Paris Olympics under a cloud amid row over handling of drugs tests\nCNN has contacted the International Olympic Committee and the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee about athletes being compensated if they are awarded a medal retrospectively.\nMissing out on medals and potential earnings has contributed towards what Montaño describes as a sense of “isolation” from the sport of track and field during a career beset with challenges.\nIn 2019, she told the New York Times that Nike said it would pause her contract and stop paying her if she wanted to have a baby, prompting the company to later adjust its maternity policy so that female athletes wouldn’t be “adversely impacted financially for pregnancy” for 18 months, which was six months more than the previous policy.\n“I definitely have felt a lot of trauma around the track and competing in the sport,” says Montaño, having last competed in an elite race in 2017.\nBut her love for running remains undiminished. She still enjoys heading out on the roads and trails and strongly believes that the sport provides a powerful, positive influence, especially when it comes to her own struggles and frustrations.\n“I feel like I leave all of that stuff behind once I lace up and I get going,” says Montaño. “Once my adrenaline starts rushing and my blood starts coursing through my body and my heart starts pumping, my head gains clarity.”\nAs for the prospect of being awarded an Olympic medal, 2028 will be a full 16 years after she raced in London and crossed the line in a state of exhaustion – an extraordinary and often painful expanse of time.\nFor Montaño, the moment should at least offer some sort of closure.\n“I’m hopeful that it’ll feel like a chapter on which we can turn a page,” she says, “instead of being stuck on the same sentence.”\n",

        "content": "For many of us, an identity card is a little piece of plastic tucked away in a wallet that we rarely think much about.\nBut for Hong Kong transgender activist Henry Tse, his ID card was something that dominated his world for the past seven years, the center of a lengthy court battle and a fight for recognition that finally concluded this week.\nOn Monday, Tse finally picked up a new ID card that registered his gender as male at Hong Kong’s immigration office.\n“This card in my hand means a lot to me and others who can finally get their new IDs,” he told reporters and photographers gathered outside.\nClad in a pink-and-blue-striped shirt over a white t-shirt – the colors of the transgender flag – he declared: “Finally, here comes the genuine solution to all the embarrassment and daily problems caused by an incompatible identity card.”\nTse’s legal battle is symptomatic of a wider trend across many places in East Asia where LGBTQ activists are forced to seek change through the courts against often conservative governments, even as public polls show growing acceptance for greater equality, especially among younger generations.\nThe 33-year-old activist, who holds both British and Hong Kong passports, identifies as a man and has lived as a man for years. His British passport identifies him as male but Hong Kong authorities refused to make that change for the city’s identity card, which is compulsory for all residents.\nThe card is essential for everything from filing tax returns and opening a bank account, to booking a tennis court or a doctor’s appointment.\nRelated article\nHong Kong’s top court tells government to create ‘legal recognition’ for same-sex partnerships\nFor years, Hong Kong authorities insisted a gender change could not be registered unless the applicant had completed full gender confirmation surgery which, under the city’s rules, meant the removal or reconstruction of their genitalia.\nTransgender rights groups have long argued that surgery is an individual’s choice and only one part of a person’s transition. Not all transgender people choose to have surgery, can afford to or are healthy enough to undergo such procedures which, like any surgery, can carry risks.\nSo in 2017, Tse took legal action against the Hong Kong government, which fought the case all the way.\nHong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal eventually ruled in Tse’s favor in February last year. But it took authorities more than a year to amend their policy to comply with the ruling, hence the long wait before Tse could finally retrieve his new ID card.\n“When I took legal action, I didn’t expect the case to last for six years and another 14 months until I can get my identity card,” Tse told CNN.\nEven under the new legal framework unveiled by Hong Kong’s government, female-to-male transgender applicants are only required to undergo top surgery (the removal of breasts). However, male-to-female applicants still must have full gender confirmation surgery.\nHong Kong’s Immigration Department said it had to “consider and study carefully” the court ruling as the policy-making process, involving legal and medical opinion, is “complex.”\nSince the ruling, the department said it had received 108 applications requesting a change of gender status. About one third of them have been approved while the rest are being processed, it told CNN.\nTse said life remained challenging while he waited for the government to act on the court order.\nHe described almost missing a flight because airline staff took issue with his gender on his old identity document and said he was detained by Chinese immigration officers while crossing the border into the mainland.\n“I was still so anxious and felt being treated like a prisoner,” he said.\nIn late March, he filed another lawsuit accusing the government of “unreasonable delay.” Two weeks later, the government announced the new policy.\nRelated article\nJapan’s top court rules against bathroom restriction for transgender government employee\nLGBTQ activists in Hong Kong have long questioned why they must keep fighting through the courts to gain recognition and equality, but they have nonetheless seen repeated successes.\nThat contrasts heavily with LGBTQ rights in mainland China where the community has come under increased pressure and scrutiny during the leadership of Xi Jinping.\nIn September last year, Hong Kong’s top court handed down the most far-reaching ruling yet, ordering the government to set up a new framework to legally recognize the rights of same-sex couples, despite not vouching for full marriage.\nThe government has not yet announced a concrete plan to put in place the court’s ruling.\nTaiwan became the first place in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage in 2019, two years after its Constitutional Court ruled that restrictions were unconstitutional.\nLast year Japan’s top court ruled against the government’s requirement that transgender people must be sterilized before they changed their gender.\nMeanwhile, a high court in Japan found in March this year that the country’s ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional, according to Reuters, in a case set to continue in the courts.\nFor Tse, his battle for equality has at least concluded.\n“What is normal for any other men has finally become normal for me,” he said.\n",

        "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\nWhat did people in the Stone Age eat before the advent of farming around 10,000 years ago? A long-held stereotype — one that’s influenced modern fad diets — is that ancient humans hunted large animals and chowed down on mammoth steak.\nBut new research on a Paleolithic group called the Iberomaurusians, hunter-gatherers who buried their dead in Taforalt cave in what’s now Morocco between 13,000 and 15,000 years ago, is adding to a growing body of evidence that challenges the notion human ancestors predominantly relied on meat, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution.\nScientists analyzed chemical signatures preserved in bones and teeth belonging to at least seven different Iberomaurusians and found that plants, not meat, were their primary source of dietary protein.\n“Our analysis showed that these hunter-gatherer groups, they included an important amount of plant matter, wild plants to their diet, which changed our understanding of the diet of pre-agricultural populations,” said lead study author Zineb Moubtahij, a doctoral student at Géosciences Environnement Toulouse, a research institute in France, and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.\nThe share of plant resources as a source of dietary protein in the humans whose remains were studied was similar to that seen in early farmers from the Levant, the present-day Eastern Mediterranean countries where plant domestication and farming were first documented.\nResearchers also spotted a higher number of tooth cavities among the Taforalt specimens than is typically seen with hunter-gatherer remains of that period. The evidence suggested that the Iberomaurusians consumed “fermentable starchy plants” such as wild cereals or acorns, according to the study. The findings raise some intriguing questions about how agriculture spread across different regions and populations.\n“While not all individuals primarily obtained their proteins from plants at Taforalt, it is unusual to document such a high proportion of plants in the diet of a pre-agricultural population,” said coauthor Klervia Jaouen, a researcher at Géosciences Environnement Toulouse, in an email.\n“This is likely the first time such a significant plant-based component in a Paleolithic diet has been documented using isotope techniques,” Jaouen added.\nThe researchers used a technique called stable isotope analysis to learn about the diet of each of the Iberomaurusians studied.\nNitrogen and zinc isotopes (variants of an element) contained in collagen and teeth enamel can reveal the amount of meat ancient diets once contained, while carbon isotopes can shed light on whether the main source of protein was meat or fish.\nRelated article\nA nutrient-rich food that once largely disappeared from Western diets was a staple of early Europeans, study finds\n“Humans consume these foods and the isotope information is recorded in tissues like bones and teeth,” Moubtahij said. “By analyzing this tissues that we find in archaeological records, we can know if a person ate more meat or they ate more plant-based food.”\nThe isotope technique shows the amount of plants eaten but not the type. However, botanical remains of charred sweet acorns, pistachio, pine nuts, wild oats and pulses discovered at the site support the information gleaned from the human remains. Grinding stones unearthed at the site also suggest plant processing took place nearby.\nHowever, the Iberomaurusians weren’t strict vegetarians, the study noted. Cut marks on the remains of Barbary sheep and gazelles, as well as ancient horselike and cowlike mammals, suggested that some animals had been butchered and processed for food.\nThe increased reliance on plant food was probably driven by several factors — including a wider range of edible plants and perhaps a depletion of large game species, according to the study.\nThe isotope analysis also detected evidence of one case of early weaning, with starchy plant foods introduced into an infant’s diet before its death at between 6 and 12 months old.\n“This contrasts with hunter-gatherer societies where extended breast-feeding periods are the norm due to the limited availability of weaning foods,” according to the study.\nThe research only investigated the diets among one group of Stone Age hunter-gatherers. However, a similar study published in January — which analyzed the remains of 24 early humans from two burial sites in Peru dating from 9,000 to 6,500 years ago — revealed that ancient diets in the Andes were composed of 80% percent plant matter and 20% meat.\nA November 2022 study revealed that Neanderthals and early Homo sapiens were sophisticated cooks, combining plant-based ingredients such as wild nuts, peas, vetch, lentils and wild mustard.\n“I don’t think that there is a standard diet for everyone (in this period), but it depends on the environment. Humans are resilient and flexible in their diet habits,” Moubtahij said.\nRelated article\nAncient teeth rarely have a cavity-causing bacteria commonly seen today. A new study reveals why\nThe work undermines the idea that a Stone Age diet was meat heavy — a rigid assumption perpetuated by present-day dietary trends like the Paleo diet. But the stereotype likely has its roots in past research, and there are a few possible reasons why.\nEvidence for meat-eating, in the form of butchered animal bones, is often more “archaeologically visible” than the evidence for plant eating, said Briana Pobiner, a research scientist and museum educator at the Human Origins Program in the department of anthropology at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. She wasn’t involved in the study.\nAnother reason for the idea that meat was central to early human diets is “the perception that hunting was a key behavioral innovation that occurred early in our evolutionary history — rooted in part in early hunter-gatherer studies carried out by male scholars that primarily focused on big game hunting by men and did not document, discounted, or downplayed the important dietary role of women gathering smaller game and plant resources,” she said via email.\nJaouen said that in the Levant region, archaeologists had documented a similar plant-based diet among another group that practiced a hunting-and-gathering lifestyle just before the development of agriculture, raising questions as to why the transition to farming did not simultaneously occur among the Iberomaurusian population.\nRelated article\nBones found in 8-meter-deep pit may ‘fundamentally change’ history of humans in Europe\n“These findings indicate that several populations at the end of the Paleolithic adopted a diet similar in terms of plant content to that of farmers,” she said.\nThe transition to agriculture was a complex process that occurred at different times and proceeded at different rates, in different ways with different foods, in different places, Pobiner said.\n“In other words, it was largely a local phenomenon that could involve transitional forms of subsistence — not a single, sharp, simultaneous worldwide shift,” she added.\n",

        "content": "On delivery day at the Manganese Metal Company’s industrial complex in Mbombela, South Africa, truckloads of manganese ore from the Kalahari Basin in the Northern Cape are ushered inside for processing.\nManganese is commonly found in the Earth’s crust. The mineral is not only known for its nutritional benefits, but it’s critical in the production of steel and batteries.\nSouth Africa has the world’s largest manganese reserves; however, the International Manganese Institute estimates only 2% of the manganese ore produced within the country is locally processed. The Manganese Metal Company is looking to fill this gap.\nThe refinery says it receives about 80,000 metric tons of manganese a year to produce high grade electrolytic manganese metal (EMM) - one of the critical alloy components to make steel.\nThe company’s CEO, Louis Nel, says over the last decade it has seen a “significant” increase in demand for refined manganese in part due to the growing demand for lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles (EV).\n“With the growth in EV sales globally, that requires raw materials and batteries. Manganese is a key component in those batteries. So of course, with the uptick in EVs, the raw materials are pulled along,” Nel said.\nMost manganese by-products are found within the steel industry. Aloys d’Harambure, the executive director of the International Manganese Institute, says only 2% of manganese is used for batteries, with only 1% of that going toward rechargeable batteries.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) found the demand for automotive lithium-ion batteries increased 65% in 2022 due to rising EV sales. And while there are several ways to create lithium-ion batteries, the chemistry combination of lithium, nickel, manganese, and cobalt oxide (NMC) supplied 60% of the market share, according to the IEA.\nCompared to other minerals used to make lithium-ion batteries, Nel says manganese, “provides some thermal stability to the battery, which is a safety concern” and is more affordable.\nWhile the opportunity sounds promising, creating these batteries is no easy feat. “A battery consumes manganese in the form of chemical and that’s where the bottleneck is,” d’Harambure said.\nHe explains manufacturers need to use a high purity manganese sulfate to make the type of battery used in EVs. About 90% of these chemicals are processed in China, he adds, but notes there is a growing push to build chemical processing facilities in other parts of the world.\nRelated article\nA company bought gas rights to this land for $1. Helium means it could be worth billions\n“Next year we should see some production in South Africa and in Mexico, and progressively in the US and Australia,” he said.\nWith an abundance of manganese reserves, South Africa has potential to become a leader in high purity manganese sulfate production, but d’Harambure says “issues with the electricity sector in South Africa” and “an increase in electricity prices” have made it difficult to produce manganese chemicals and alloys there.\nD’Harambure adds the country has been slow to open manganese chemical processing facilities due to the lack of local customers that would use the product.\n“It’s better to build the manganese chemical facility near the customer because transporting manganese to another country is not extremely expensive – what is expensive is producing the chemical,” he said.\nThese obstacles are not stopping the Manganese Metal Company from trying to capitalize on the EV boom and expand its processing facilities. The company says it is planning to build a $25 million commercial plant that can produce 5,000 metric tons of battery-grade manganese sulphate a year. Nel says he’s optimistic it can complete the build within 18 months and bring products to market by the end of 2026.\nAccess to this “strategic” metal valued by the US and Europe gives Africa advantages, Nel says, adding it will also generate “huge job creation opportunities, as well as economic growth.”\nSeveral sectors within the local economy are already reaping the benefits of manganese. According to the International Manganese Institute, the manganese mining industry employed more than 20,000 South Africans in 2022.\nD’Harambure also points to a need beyond steel and batteries for the green economy.\n“Manganese is essential to producing several other green power technologies including solar panels (and) wind turbines. It’s also used to treat wastewater and extract pollutants from soil and air,” he said. “So, the whole push towards greener energy directly benefits to manganese industry.”\n",

        "content": "Aimee Nezhukumatathil is not one to sugarcoat the past.\nTake vanilla, for example — that heady, aromatic stem taking you back to sickly sweet children’s birthday cake or that scented lotion you had as a teen. But Nezhukumatathil writes about baking with her young son, creating vanilla extract with vodka to give as gifts, carefully scraping the seeds out of their pod with the dull side of a knife. The essay — one of 40 in her new book, “Bite by Bite” — isn’t just about her son, or vanilla. It’s also about Edmond Albios, an enslaved boy who discovered a new way to pollinate the vanilla orchids in a way that changed the vanilla industry. Vanilla is the vehicle through which her parallels are drawn.\n“Bite by Bite,” out on April 30, is poet Nezhukumatathil’s seventh book. It’s her second of prose, following the success of 2020’s “World of Wonders.” And, most notably, it’s her love letter to food. Each chapter of “Bite by Bite” focuses on a food — everything from apples to butter to the Filipino dessert halo-halo.\nBut these chapters, these essays, are not recited histories of ingredients or dishes. Instead, Nezhukumatathil weaves a personal memoir through food. In the chapter “Tomato,” she writes about her mother and grandmother — juxtaposing the path of the tomato from Spain to the Philippines and from Portugal to India with her own ancestry. “Lychee” is an ode to her Asian American writer community in New York. “Shave Ice” eulogizes female friendship.\n“I wanted to celebrate how delicious a full life could be,” Nezhukumatathil told CNN in a recent interview.\nBut, like with vanilla, that deliciousness doesn’t always mean sweet. There are sad tales here, too, dark histories underlying warm memories. Nezhukumatathil doesn’t waver. Food can be a map toward home, toward memory, toward lineage, her book argues. And with it, she beckons us to explore.\nCNN’s conversation with Nezhukumatathil has been edited for length and clarity.\nSo much of your writing brings the delights and oddities of nature to the forefront, but what made you turn your microscope to food specifically?\nThe majority of it (the book) was written in 2021, so although I did start a few essays before the pandemic, most of it was after the pandemic.\nI think after a time of being so separate, and having leaders who want to divide us so much, I wanted to focus on what nourishes us and also what can bring us back together. And for me, that was food.\nOne of the things I missed so much, I think so many people did, is being able to sit with our families, our loved ones around the table. There’s so many books that are the search for home.\nThis is a search for what kinds of homes we can make with food. There’s chosen family, there’s family, and there’s our birth family, and all of our friends and everything in between. Our crushes and our exes, and all of that. But food is one big connector, so I really wanted to focus in on that.\nYeah, this topic gets talked about a lot — how food can hold memory or be a cultural tie. But you talk about the origins of food — not just food as a connector between me and somebody else, but foods’ own history, like, the etymology of cinnamon or the origins of the Concord grape. How did you go about researching and thinking about food in that way?\nThe simple answer is I’m just a giant nerd. So many of these things I actually modeled from my parents. Since I was a little kid, I would always watch them asking questions of the grocery store or the different markets we were at — farmers markets and things like that. I would watch how they garden. They also had vast knowledges of mangoes, of course, for both of their countries, India and the Philippines. So they always modeled the sense of curiosity for me.\nIt wasn’t like I sit down and say, ‘I will research the origin of sugar,’ but rather I cannot eat sugarcane without what little I was taught about the horrors of the sugarcane trade as a global history. We have a little Christmas Eve tradition in my family about sugar cane. I couldn’t write about that and ignore the not so great origin stories of some of these ingredients and vegetables and fruits and meals.\nWhat I wanted was to make you slow down and think about what are the stories that connect, and I think that learning that way of thinking about your own life becomes contagious. Like hey, I thought I knew apples but did you know this or did you make this connection, and maybe my story of eating a gyro sandwich might make you think of a time when you missed one of your parents or guardians, things like that. My hope is that curiosity becomes contagious for you as well.\nYou mention eating a gyro sandwich. While I was reading, I had expected natural ingredients. We’re going to talk about fruit, we’re going to talk about vegetables. I was really surprised at some of the inclusions of lumpia and gyros and risotto and flan and all of these other things that you also talk about. What made you incorporate those elements alongside the more raw ingredients?\nIt’s so funny that you mentioned that, because that was a source of much distress for me. When I was thinking about it, and just looking at my home library, my local library, at bookstores — almost every food book is like, here’s a book on desserts. Here’s a book of vegetables, or here’s snacks. Here’s a book all on chocolate. I didn’t want to write anything first of all that was like anything else that was on the bookshelf.\nThe Table of Contents came about because I was thinking of instances in my life when I felt connected to people, and so I was thinking of scenes first and food second in some ways. Because I wanted to have that overall. I wanted to start and end this book with love.\nI was thinking of scenes first and food second … I wanted to start and end this book with love.\n\nIt was more of like, the feeling and the scenes were important to me, and then I had to go back and say like, ‘Okay, what fruit encompasses this?’ ‘What food encompasses this feeling?’ What was going on in the scene that made me feel so welcome, or not welcome, you know? Or uncomfortable, a little bit. I was really concerned about the emotion and location of what was going on rather than, I have to make a nice, neat, orderly Table of Contents of all sweet things, or all vegetables and just vegetables. I didn’t want it to be like a memoir in vegetables. So although I’m sure that book exists somewhere, it just wasn’t for me, you know?\nRight. But you also highlight some of the darker origins of some of these ingredients, like, in the “Vanilla” chapter, the enslaved child discovering how to pollinate vanilla orchids. Was that something you always intended to do?\nI read a lot for this book. And I definitely, in the back, included all the books that I was looking at. I did not know that I really was going to be writing about vanilla and my son, and it was absolute coincidence that I came across like oh the person that made vanilla what it is, was a young boy too.\nI really wanted to kind of celebrate, again what nourishes us, what brings us together. And part of that is facing some not-so-great moments of the past as well. I just wanted to be as honest as possible. And yet I didn’t want to linger on that kind of past I wanted to, again, have each essay begin and end with a note of love.\nIs there anything about your own relationship with a certain food that you didn’t think about before that you discovered while you were writing?\nI wanted to collect a gathering of essays that showcase different facets of being who I am on the cusp of 50. I wanted to celebrate childhood. I wanted to celebrate the exuberance and the exhilaration of meeting my girlfriends downtown in New York City when I was single, and happy. I also didn’t want it to be like, oh, a man rescued me.\nYet, there’s also been kind of a lot of books about how terrible some men are in marriage, and also like, kids are encroaching on me being an artist. That’s definitely some people’s experiences for sure. And I don’t want to negate that. But for this book, I wanted to showcase in particular for women of color, there are other ways of making it through. You do not need to have a dramatic fight. You do not need to have a jerk of a husband. You can actually like spending time with your kids and like spending time with your husband and also really enjoy your chosen family as well. You know what I mean?\nThere’s different food books that showcase, ‘Look at me finding myself’ or ‘look at me now that I have a family.’ Or, like ‘I’m a mom,’ ‘look at me now that I’m newly divorced.’ I wanted to celebrate all of it.\nYeah, there’s that trope of diaspora poetry and the trauma in that — not to say those things are not valid, but in your work you almost invite the reader into your world and into your family in a way you don’t see, particularly in writing.\nWe are not the perfect family, I make plenty of mistakes and mess up a lot. But what it comes down to is that I like spending time with my family. I truly do and, and I also love spending time teaching. You don’t have to choose one or the other.\nWe are not the perfect family, I make plenty of mistakes and mess up a lot. But what it comes down to is that I like spending time with my family.\n\nSometimes I am kind of a hot mess, and other times, it’s like, Hey, we’re gonna do takeout because mama has a deadline or dad has a deadline. But I think it’s also really important for people to see possibility. To see, hey, there’s another narrative out there of how to live rather than kind of these tired tropes that we see like, ‘I’m desperately embarrassed of my food, but now, I’m not’ you know, it’s just a work in progress.\nYou include some writing food prompts at the end of the book. What spurred you to do that?\nOne thing that occurred during really all of my books, but in particular with the last one ‘World of Wonders,’ is that so many people — and I don’t know if it’s because it was released during the pandemic or what — but so many people let their guard down and were a little bit more vulnerable with me in book signing lines, in zoos, in just straight up email and letters to me, saying how much they wanted to get back to writing. Or they used to write, but they didn’t know where to begin, they don’t have time.\nI just recently taught a class in San Antonio where there were two young mothers and I could hear the kind of the pain and nervousness in their voice, I get choked up thinking about it, saying like, ‘I don’t know who I am anymore. I used to be so creative, and I don’t know what to do. But your book makes me want to do something,’ you know, that kind of thing.\nAnd so I just I wanted to help all those hundreds and hundreds of people who have asked me like, I don’t know where to begin to write. So I designed these over 20 years of teaching at the college level and elementary school level, and grad students and senior citizens in high school. I compiled a selection of writing prompts to get — hopefully at least one of them, but hopefully all of them — your imagination going and get you to slow down and contemplate your life and your relationship to food.\nYou don’t have to publish them. You can but you can just write in a journal and nobody needs to see it. But there is a way to help those folks who wanted a place to start and it seems overwhelming. And I’m here to say it’s not; to start small with these prompts.\n",

        "content": "Volkswagen’s orders for electric vehicles shot up in Europe in the first quarter of 2024 compared with a year ago, countering suggestions that drivers may be losing interest in EVs.\nNew orders for electric cars more than doubled in Europe, Volkswagen said in an earnings statement Tuesday. The company does not release order numbers for other markets.\nThe jump in orders at Europe’s biggest carmaker comes amid concerns about slowing EV sales in the region, and as EV makers grapple with slim profits margins, squeezed by increasing competition.\n“The future will be electric, this is our conviction,” chief financial officer Arno Antlitz told analysts and journalists on a call Tuesday. He acknowledged, however, that the pace of EV sales growth in Europe and the United States had been slower than the German carmaker had originally anticipated.\nEV penetration “will increase quarter-by-quarter, year-over-year, but not as fast as we have expected,” he said.\nAs for Volkswagen’s EV deliveries, they declined 16% in Europe in the first quarter compared with the same period in 2023. “All-electric deliveries in Europe were impacted by supply bottlenecks,” a company spokesperson told CNN. “There is a time gap between incoming orders and the delivery to the customer. The supply bottlenecks mentioned impacted the delivery performance in Q1.”\nRelated article\nA brutal elimination round is reshaping the world’s biggest market for electric cars\nMeanwhile, in China, Volkswagen’s single largest market, EV deliveries almost doubled to 41,033 units from a “weak prior-year figure,” the company said in a statement.\nThe champion of German manufacturing is struggling to defend its share of the Chinese car market — the biggest in the world — where it has fallen behind Tesla and local EV producers such as BYD.\nVolkswagen said its plans to significantly reduce battery and material costs would enable it to be cost-competitive with Chinese rivals by 2026. That should then allow it to reduce the price of its EVs in China, where fierce competition has led to intense price wars.\nOn EVs, “you see… a very challenging pricing environment” in China, Antlitz said. He added that Volkswagen would make “sound compromises” between “pricing and volume” in the country.\nThe carmaker plans to launch four new models in China over the next three years, two of which will be electric, while reducing time to market for new products and features by 30%.\n“With these actions and our highly profitable combustion engine car business, we are well-prepared to continue to play a leading role in China,” Antlitz said.\nVolkswagen is aiming to keep its market share in China roughly stable at 15% by the end of the decade, according to a presentation to investors.\nThe company’s profit plunged 20% to €4.6 billion ($4.9 billion) in the the first quarter, hurt by lower sales and higher costs.\n“As expected, our first-quarter results show a slow start to the year,” Antlitz said in a statement. But he added: “We remain confident of achieving our financial targets for 2024.”\nVolkswagen expects to pay out €900 million ($965 million) in severance costs to employees this year, as it slashes the size of its workforce as part of a €10 billion ($10.8 billion) cost-cutting program to boost efficiency.\n",

        "content": "Paramount Global on Monday parted ways with its chief executive, Bob Bakish, in a seismic move that sent reverberations through the media conglomerate as it actively engages in acquisition talks with Skydance Media.\nIn place of Bakish, who led the company since controlling shareholder Shari Redstone reunited Viacom and CBS Corporation under one roof in 2019, will be a triumvirate of leaders: Brian Robbins, chief executive of Paramount Pictures; Chris McCarthy, chief executive of Showtime and MTV Entertainment Studios; and George Cheeks, chief executive of CBS.\n“The Board and I thank Bob for his many contributions over his long career, including in the formation of the combined company as well as his successful efforts to rebuild the great culture Paramount has long been known for. We wish him all the best,” Redstone said in a statement.\nThe team of three leaders will guide the company in the interim as Paramount’s board negotiates a deal with Skydance, which is led by David Ellison, son of the billionaire Larry Ellison, ending the Redstone family’s control of the company, which has produced blockbuster franchises including “Top Gun,” “Star Trek” and “Transformers.”\nThe relationship between Redstone and Bakish had become frosty in recent months, people familiar with the matter told CNN. Redstone and other board members took issue with Bakish’s strategic decisions, including not offloading the premium cable channel Showtime and striking a deal to sell BET.\nThe critical view of Bakish came as Paramount, with its heavy reliance on the cable television business, found it increasingly difficult to maintain profits amid the rapid industry transition to streaming. Shares of Paramount’s stock (PARA) have dropped nearly 50% over the last year.\nWhile legacy media companies have struggled immensely in recent years, Paramount, with its vast portfolio of cable outlets including Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central, was greatly exposed to shifting consumer habits with millions of people abandoning cable each year in favor of services like Netflix.\nIn an attempt to stave off declining cable revenues, Paramount has spent billions of dollars building its own streaming service, Paramount+. But like the platforms of other legacy media companies, it has struggled to gain the necessary traction to supplement linear losses. Part of the challenge for Paramount is its content library is simply not deep enough to persuade enough customers to purchase a monthly subscription in what has become a crowded space. On Monday, the company reported its paid subscriber base had grown to 71.2 million subscribers.\nSupporters of the Skydance deal hope that merging Paramount with the Ellison-led company will change its fortunes. Skydance has promised to invest heavily in a combined company, infusing at least $3 billion in cash to pay down debt and purchase stock, a person familiar with the matter told CNN.\nSkydance made its “best and final” offer to Paramount on Sunday, the person said. The deal values Skydance at approximately $5 billion.\nThe offer aims to placate shareholders who have expressed concern with the deal on the table. Those shareholders have argued the deal primarily benefits Redstone and they have encouraged Paramount’s board to evaluate other options. The offer from Skydance would see the company purchase a swath of Paramount shares at a premium price, the person familiar with the matter explained.\nIf approved, the committee of Paramount executives would then lead the company until the deal is completed and a new permanent leadership team takes the helm. In addition to Ellison, a possible top executive for a merged Paramount-Skydance company would be Jeff Shell, the former NBCUniversal chief executive who was fired last year after a sexual harassment claim was lodged against him.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n",

        "content": "Five times the size of Paris. Visible from space. The world’s biggest energy plant. Enough electricity to power Switzerland.\nThe scale of the project transforming swathes of barren salt desert on the edge of western India into one of the most important sources of clean energy anywhere on the planet is so overwhelming that the man in charge can’t keep up.\n“I don’t even do the math any more,” Sagar Adani told CNN in an interview last week.\nAdani is executive director of Adani Green Energy Limited (AGEL). He’s also the nephew of Gautam Adani, Asia’s second richest man, whose $100 billion fortune stems from the Adani Group, India’s biggest coal importer and a leading miner of the dirty fuel. Founded in 1988, the conglomerate has businesses in fields ranging from ports and thermal power plants to media and cements.\nIts clean energy unit AGEL is building the sprawling solar and wind power plant in the western Indian state of Gujarat at a cost of about $20 billion. It will be the world’s biggest renewable park when it is finished in about five years, and should generate enough clean electricity to power 16 million Indian homes.\nThe success of the Khavda Renewable Energy Park is critical to India’s efforts to reduce pollution and hit its climate goals while meeting the burgeoning energy needs of the world’s most populous nation and fastest-growing major economy. Coal still accounts for 70% of the electricity India generates.\nSituated just 12 miles from one of the world’s most dangerous borders separating India and Pakistan, the park will cover more than 200 square miles and be the planet’s largest power plant regardless of the energy source, AGEL said.\n“A region so large, a region that is so unencumbered, there’s no wildlife, there’s no vegetation, there’s no habitation. There is no better alternative use of that land,” said Adani.\nThe group’s big green plans haven’t been dented by the turbulent year it has had since January 2023, when an American short-seller Hindenburg Research accused it of engaging in fraud over decades.\nThe Indian mining-to-media conglomerate denounced Hindenburg’s report as “baseless” and “malicious.” But that failed to halt a stunning stock market meltdown that, at one point, wiped more than $100 billion off the value of its listed companies. Gautam Adani’s personal fortune was also hammered, collapsing by more than $80 billion in the month following the release of the report.\nBut the tycoon has since bounced back and the group is now pouring billions into the clean energy sector.\nIt plans to invest $100 billion into energy transition over the next decade, with 70% of the investments ear-marked for clean energy.\nAdani Group’s clean energy pivot comes at a time when India has set itself some ambitious climate goals. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised that renewable sources such as solar and wind power will fulfil 50% of India’s energy requirements by the end of this decade.\nIn 2021, Modi pledged India would achieve net zero emissions by 2070, which is still a couple of decades later than developed economies.\nThe government has set a target of 500 gigawatts (GW) of non-fossil fuel electricity generating capacity by 2030. AGEL, the country’s largest renewable energy company, aims to provide at least 9% of that, with nearly 30 GW generated from its Khavda park in Gujarat alone.\nFailing to transition to renewable energy is not an option, said Adani.\n“There is no choice for India but to start doing things at a previously unimagined size and scale,” the 30-year-old said.\nThat’s because energy demand is going to explode in the coming years.\nIndia is the world’s third-largest energy consuming country, although its energy use and emissions per person are less than half the world average, data from the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) shows.\nThat could change rapidly. Thanks to rising incomes, energy demand has doubled since 2000, with 80% of it still being met by coal, oil and solid biomass. Over the next three decades, the rapidly-expanding economy will see the largest energy demand growth of any country in the world, the IEA said.\n“If India does what China did, if India does what Europe did, if India does what the US did, then we are all in for a very, very bleak climatic future,” said Adani, referring to the historic use of fossil fuels as those countries developed.\nHis dire predictions are not dramatic. India is comfortably placed to grow at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years, analysts say, and may become the world’s third largest economy before the end of this decade.\nAs it develops and modernizes, its urban population will shoot up, leading to a massive rise in the construction of homes, offices, shops and other buildings. According to analysts, India is set to add the equivalent of a London to its urban population every year for the next 30 years.\nElectricity demand is expected to skyrocket in the coming years because of factors ranging from improved living standards to climate change. The latter has been fueling deadly heatwaves across India, and as a result, air conditioner ownership is set to see a sharp spike in the coming years.\nBy 2050, India’s total electricity demand from residential air conditioners is set to exceed the total energy consumption in the whole of Africa today, the IEA said.\nIndia cannot rely on fossil fuels for its burgeoning needs without disastrous consequences for efforts to tackle the climate crisis.\n“If you imagine 800 GW of coal-fired thermal capacity being added … this by itself will kill all other sustainable energy initiatives happening all across the world, in terms of carbon emissions,” said Adani.\nThe conglomerate’s green plans are impressive, but climate experts are critical of its continued massive investments in fossil fuels.\n“[Gautam] Adani continues to walk both sides of the street,” said Tim Buckley, director of Sydney-based think tank Climate Energy Finance.\nThe Adani Group is not only one of the largest developers and operators of coal mines in India, but also operates the controversial Carmichael Coal Mine in Australia, which has faced fierce opposition from climate change campaigners who say it is a “death sentence” for the Great Barrier Reef.\n“Rather than ploughing billions into new fossil fuel projects, India would be far better served if Adani put 100% of its efforts and resources into developing low-cost zero emissions technologies,” Buckley added.\nThat is not an option at the moment, said Adani.\nMore than 600 million people in India will be “coming into middle income and upper income over the next decade, decade and a half,” he said. “They cannot be deprived of basic needs of energy. ”\nEveryone would be happy if we could “have a 100% of that being provided from sustainable energy sources …[but]… practically, that’s not an option” at the moment, he added.\nHe also said that activists in developed nations, which have historically emitted more greenhouse gases, are often unable to understand the staggering challenge facing India to grow its economy and its clean energy industry at the same time.\n“I think it’s also very important to respect the fact that every country has its own right to make sure that the people of their own country are well-served from an energy perspective,” Adani said.\n“So is India doing a bit of coal? Yes, of course India is. But is India doing a massive amount of renewables? Yes, there’s no question,” he added\n",

        "content": "The home insurance market is crumbling in New Orleans, leaving Alfredo Herrera with few options for coverage — and skyrocketing insurance premiums.\nHerrera, 35, works in finance for a local bank. He bought his 900-square-foot home in New Orleans’ Mid-City neighborhood in 2020 for $270,000, and lives there with his partner.\nIn 2022, he paid $1,600 a year for home insurance. But last July, his insurer canceled his coverage, saying it was leaving Louisiana.\nIn the past, acquiring or keeping homeowners’ insurance didn’t present much of a problem.\nBut as climate change increases the frequency and severity of extreme weather, insurers — especially those in areas most impacted by floods and fires — are raising their premiums, or pulling out altogether, impacting the affordability and availability of home and fire insurance.\nHerrera shopped around for a new plan, but he struggled to find a policy. Louisiana Citizens, the insurer of last resort for property owners in the state, was out of the question. It would have cost more than $7,000 annually.\nHerrera eventually found a policy with a small company in the state that charged him $4,930 annually — a 208% increase from what he paid in 2022.\n“It’s a very difficult situation,” he said. He never imagined that when he bought his home, private insurance options would be this limited and the last resort insurer would be so expensive.\n“We’re against the wall,” Herrera said. “There’s no competition.”\nHerrera’s insurance story is common in Louisiana and other places across the country at increasingly higher risk for extreme weather.\nThere were a record 28 weather and climate disasters with losses totaling over $1 billion last year in America, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. By comparison, between 1980 and 2023, the typical annual average for these events was 8.5.\nA Louisiana State University survey last year found that 17% of Louisiana homeowners reported their provider canceled their policy. Sixty-three percent of policyholders said the cost of their insurance coverage increased from the prior year, the survey found.\nThere was roughly a 10% to 12% increase in homeowners’ insurance costs last year in the United States, said Mark Friedlander, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute, a nonprofit industry association.\nRelated article\nInsurance premiums could surge in these American cities because of climate disasters, new data shows\nThe main drivers are the higher costs insurers face, including from more severe storms; higher replacement costs; and re-insurance, the type of insurance used by insurers to limit their risks. These are passed on to consumers. So even if a homeowner doesn’t live in a high-risk area, that owner is likely paying a higher premium to cover people in the riskiest places.\nIn 2023, Neil Fernandes paid $1,700 a year for Farmers Insurance coverage for his home in Santa Clarita, California, where the 42-year-old software engineer lives with his wife and child.\nBut last year, Farmers said it was raising his premium to $3,200. When he asked why, Farmers cited rising costs and increased fire hazards in the state. Fernandes said the fire hazards around his home haven’t changed and he lives a quarter mile from a fire station.\nHe started shopping around for other policies, but he found limited options.\nFrustrated by the lack of choices, he switched to AAA home insurance for $2,880 a year.\nHe and his family have had to change their lifestyle to cover the increase. He’s driving less to save on car insurance. They aren’t eating out as much, or traveling, and are putting off home improvement upgrades.\nFernandes is challenging AAA’s assessment of his home insurance value, which he said is over-estimated.\nAAA did not comment to CNN.\nAnd he worries about more home insurance price shocks in the future, something he did not anticipate when he bought his home.\n“As a home owner, I always worry about things like paying taxes for good schools and community upkeep,” he said. “Now I have to worry about insurance coverage.”\nIn some places most exposed to climate change, insurers have stopped issuing policies.\nIn May, State Farm, the largest home insurer in California, announced it would pause issuing policies in that state, citing wildfire risks. Farmers Insurance deemed it too risky to continue insuring homes in Florida and pulled out of the market there entirely.\nOn March 20, State Farm said it would not renew 72,000 home insurance policies in California, representing just over 2% of the company’s policies in the state. The company cited “inflation, catastrophe exposure [and] reinsurance costs” among the reasons.\nMore people are being driven to the state-supported “insurer of last resort,” where they typically have to pay more money for a narrower policy.\nMore states are looking to start state-backed insurance providers as companies pull out.\nIn Florida, Citizens Property Insurance has seen the number of policies it has issued rise about 50% in the last year alone to 1.3 million — equal to 16% of the market and far more than any national insurer writes in the state.\nThe US Senate Budget Committee is launching an investigation into whether Florida’s state-backed home and property insurance company has enough money in the bank to withstand future disasters.\nBut climate change isn’t the only factor driving up costs. Insurance companies also point to the rising cost of replacing homes, as inflation for building supplies and labor has soared.\nThe insurance industry says that rebuilding and replacement costs surged 55% between 2019 and 2022. Costs have since fallen, however. And reinsurance has gone up between 30% and 40% after years of losses in the industry, according to Matthew Carletti, an insurance industry analyst for JMP Securities.\nHomeowners who have a mortgage are not able to go without homeowners insurance as their mortgage servicer will require an escrow account for insurance. But for those who have paid off their home or bought it with cash, the high additional costs of homeowners insurance and the challenge of getting it can lead some to take their chances without it.\nSome 6 million homeowners chose to forgo homeowners insurance, according to a report from the Consumer Federation of America. That’s about 7.4% of all homeowners in the country, and amounts to about $1.6 trillion of unprotected value.\nCFA warned that the problem of uninsured homes is likely to get worse in coming years unless major investments in climate change adaptation and stronger oversight of the insurance industry are made.\nDiana Troxell and her husband are not sure how they will pay for their 250% annual premium increase for their manufactured home in rural Cottonwood, California. Right now, they are getting help from family to pay for groceries and gas.\nTroxell, 76, works seasonally as a face painter at the county fair. She and her husband rely primarily on Social Security to scrape by.\nThey have lived in their home for 19 years and had a policy with Foremost Insurance, paying about $1,910 a year.\nBut Foremost last year told them their policy would not be renewed due to wildfire exposure.\n“We went into a shock mode,” she said. “We couldn’t figure out what to do.”\nThey looked to sell their home and rent in California, but they couldn’t afford it.\nWith no other insurance options available, they turned to California FAIR Plan, a state program for residents and businesses who can’t obtain insurance through a regular insurance company. In 2021, the FAIR Plan accounted for 3% of the state’s policies in 2021, nearly double the share from 2018.\nNow they are paying about $6,660 a year through the FAIR plan.\n“We’re in ‘how are we going to do this’ mode?” she said. “We’re living month to month.”\nCNN’s Ella Nilsen contributed to this article.\n",

        "content": "Arianna Smith is juggling a lot right now.\nSmith is editor-in-chief of The Lantern, Ohio State University’s student-run newspaper, which has scrambled in recent days to cover pro-Palestinian protests roiling the campus.\nIt’s also finals week, and in the coming days the newspaper’s staff will transition to the next year’s staff. But the news doesn’t account for exams.\n“We have had reporters and editors drop everything they are doing [to cover the story], even though they have finals that they should be studying for,” Smith told CNN.\nAs universities across the country crack down on demonstrations over Israel’s military actions in Gaza and police arrest hundreds of protesters, student-run newspapers have quickly become an essential source of news coverage for both the campus communities and nation at large, providing crucial transparency and scrutiny of authorities.\nAnd, for many of these student journalists, it’s becoming a seminal moment in their nascent careers.\n“It’s so important to have journalists that care about being objective, and to have journalists that really know the power that their writing has,” Smith said of her newspaper’s reporters.\nWhen demonstrations broke out on the Columbus campus this week, resulting in multiple arrests, the Lantern’s staff reported from the protest scenes, detailed actions of the police, and investigated Ohio State University policies barring encampments.\n“We’re not only covering the protests, but we’re covering and getting the opinions from these people that are involved in this protest,” Smith said. “And we’re also making sure that we’re analyzing the legalities behind all of these policies that the university is enforcing.”\nAt the University of Southern California, nearly 100 people were arrested this week as protests swelled on campus and university leaders imposed restrictions on demonstrations.\nAnjali Patel, editor-in-chief of the university’s newspaper, The Daily Trojan, immediately recognized the student-led publication had an advantage over the national press as they raced to cover the story.\n“Given that we’re student journalists, we know the campus and the students here. That gives us a different angle than professional news outlets,” Patel said. “We’re also completely student-led, so the way that we approach work and reporting is different, but I think that’s to our advantage.”\nThe tension at USC has been boiling since administrators canceled its Muslim valedictorian’s commencement speech — and, on Thursday, the main graduation ceremony — citing safety concerns. As pressure mounted on campus, the newspaper mobilized a handful of writers who worked together to cover the protests. But, as police were deployed on campus, The Daily Trojan increased the number of assigned reporters to cover events.\nWhen officers moved to make dozens of arrests Wednesday at a protest encampment, it was “all hands on deck,” Patel said, adding that The Daily Trojan deployed at least five photographers and eight other staff members to cover the demonstrations.\nThese young journalists, while juggling classes and the stress of exams, are also intimately involved with the student community, translating the student body’s mood on their campus for the rest of the nation.\nAt the University of Texas at Austin, dozens of protesters were arrested Wednesday after pro-Palestinian demonstrators were met by state troopers “in full riot gear with batons,” Amelia Kimball, associate managing editor of The Daily Texan told CNN.\nKimball reported that there was a “physical clash” between students and police on campus with numerous students taken into custody and “put in squad cars.”\nThe arrests came as Texas Governor Greg Abbott warned that “antisemitism will not be tolerated in Texas” and called for students participating in the protests to be expelled.\n“I think there’s a real feeling of betrayal on campus and I think there’s a lot of anger [after students were arrested],” Kimball told CNN’s John Berman.\n“State troopers were on campus before students even began to gather,” Kimball added. “And so things just escalated far beyond what students had expected at all, and so yeah, I think students feel betrayed by the university and by our state government.”\n",

This place has shaped me as a leader, taught me resilience, shown me the value of perspective and how to make hard decisions.”\nMark Thompson, CNN’s chief executive, praised Harlow as a “unique talent who combines formidable reporting and interviewing prowess with a human touch that audiences have always responded to.”\n“She’s been a wonderful colleague at CNN, and we know she will have much success in her future endeavors,” Thompson said.\nAmy Entelis, executive vice president of talent and content, also praised Harlow in a statement, saying she “leaves CNN after more than 16 memorable years, thousands of hours in the anchor chair and hundreds of reports from the field.”\n“Poppy is a brilliant journalist who sets the standard for reporting with compassion and humanity, and we will miss her,” Entelis said.\nHarlow joined CNN in 2008 and worked in a variety of roles at the network. During her time, she reported across the world on some of the biggest and most consequential news stories, including the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings and 2015 Paris terror attacks.\nHarlow, who has a background in business journalism, hosted the “Boss Files” podcast and also regularly landed notable executives for interviews, including Warren Buffet, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill and Melinda Gates, Susan Wojcicki, Jamie Dimon and others.\nIn 2022, then-CNN chief Chris Licht tapped Harlow to help relaunch the network’s flagship morning show. Harlow became co-host with Kaitlan Collins and Don Lemon. The show, however, struggled to capture an audience and behind-the-scenes drama fueled tabloid headlines. Lemon was ultimately dismissed from the network and Collins was moved to helm a solo prime time show.\nThompson, after taking over from Licht, announced in February that he would reconfigure CNN’s morning lineup. “CNN This Morning” changed time slots and moved to Washington, D.C., where it is now hosted by Kasie Hunt.\nThe new morning show lineup left Harlow without an anchor slot. CNN engaged in discussions with Harlow, but ultimately she decided to exit the network.\nIn her email to colleagues, Harlow said that in the immediate future she looks forward to spending more time with family.\n“For now, my plan is to walk our children to school and pick them up (hopefully they won’t get sick of me!), and to support the evolution of journalism in every way I can, while preserving the human(ity) in it,” Harlow wrote. “I’m excited for what is ahead – and I will be rooting for CNN always.”\n",

        "content": "A house purchase is often one of the trickiest life experiences to negotiate, requiring huge deliberations on location before spending weeks searching for the right property. Finding somewhere in another country is even more fraught with difficult decisions.\nUnless, of course, you’re Paul Millet.\nIn which case, you land in Italy for the first time, and before the first day is done, you’ve bought yourself a beautiful old house with great views in the middle of southern Italy’s Basilicata region.\nBut Millet, a Los Angeles-based television editor, knew exactly what he was doing. The 54-year-old was lured to Italy by houses being sold for one euro, or just over a dollar. But he quickly realized that these came with a catch – the need to spend thousands to make them livable.\n“I read an article on CNN about the one-euro properties being offered back in 2015 and my interest was definitely piqued,” he says. “I had been to various countries in the European Union on several occasions but never Italy, though it was on my list.\n“I cannot express exactly why I was drawn to the idea of buying a one-euro property and renovating it, but it was something that captured my imagination.”\nInstead, Millet turned his attention to other properties that, while more expensive because they were essentially all ready to move into, were still being sold at bargain prices.\nRelated article\nHow moving from the US to Costa Rica’s ‘blue zone’ transformed this family’s life forever\nFor him, Latronico, a stunning cliff top village in Basilicata, was the perfect destination. The destination had sold only two homes priced at one euro and instead focused its efforts on cheaply offloading renovated or occupiable houses in order to revive its dwindling population.\nAfter listing empty properties online via website https://casalatronico.eu/, liaising between old and prospective new owners, it’s so far sold 50 properties, mostly to American buyers.\nMillet says that he began planning to travel to Italy to buy a house back in 2019, but was thwarted by Covid-19. He finally managed to visit in 2022 after attending a friend’s wedding in Ireland.\nHe picked Latronico because the locals running the house sales program seemed extremely responsive to his inquiries compared to other cheap-home towns he’d contacted prior to his trip.\n“The prices of the houses were super-attractive, especially coming from the Los Angeles area, and the Latronico properties were for the most part in good shape.\n“Unlike the one-euro programs, I was under no obligation to do anything with any house I purchased. Obviously, renovation and making the properties viable was the objective, but as a foreign buyer I could do with it what I wanted. I liked that,” says Millet.\nThe tailored property tour organized by officials in Latronico made him fall in love with the village and he was completely taken by its beauty and the warm reception from locals, he says.\n“At the end of the day, I bought my place and began thinking about renovations and the future,” he adds.\nMillet has no plans to make a permanent move to Latronico. For now he sees it has a bolt hole where he can slow down and unplug.\n“I plan to come at least once a year to get away from it all,” he says. “The place will act as a foothold for future traveling around the EU. I’ll probably list it as a vacation rental for when I am not there to keep the place alive, and share it with family and friends.”\nThe one-bedroom, 60-square-meter house he bought cost 12,000 euros (just under $13,000). He expects to spend up to $35,000 on sprucing it up.\nThe property boasts a balcony, storage attic and a rooftop terrace with a “view to die for,” says Millet, describing the vista as the “cherry on top.”\nRelated article\nThey moved from the US to cook American food in deepest Italy. Here’s what happened\nAlthough the house is small, it has two basements which are being re-purposed, one featuring a cave which once housed livestock and the other an ancient bread oven built into the wall that still works.\nRenovation work is almost complete.\n“There was foundation work needed in the larger of the two basements,” Millet says. “I had a reinforced concrete floor installed and the electrical system was completely replaced.\n“Since the larger basement is so sizable, I decided to turn it into a living space that will include an additional bedroom with a small adjoining sitting room that will also have a half bath and laundry facilities for the house.”\nThe house’s ancient, rough stone walls were whitewashed to brighten up the space. The new concrete floor was stained and sealed.\n“It looks terrific. I just need to add the half-bath, do some additional cosmetic work and get furnishings and it will be done,” Millet adds.\nMillet has kept all the original vintage tiles and will add new modern accent tiles to dress it up. The house exterior will get a fresh coat of paint and he plans to tile both the rooftop terrace and the steps leading to the main entrance door.\nHe says he can’t wait to have friends enjoying sunset cocktails on the terrace and then dinner in the kitchen below afterwards.\nMillet says he was captured by Latronico’s peacefulness, a stark contrast to hectic LA.\n“It’s just such a slower lifestyle here,” he says. “My life in Los Angeles moves so fast. Work deadlines and obligations, and so many social things going on. I do enjoy my life there, but taking a moment to remove myself from that environment is very refreshing. Latronico will definitely help me relax.”\nRelated article\nThis US couple bought a home in the ‘forgotten region’ of Italy. Here’s what happened next\nThe village is so remote and off the beaten track that it doesn’t even show on some navigation apps. Millet says the map application on his mobile has very little idea about how to get around Latronico.\n“Both times I’ve come, the maps app has not successfully led me to the Airbnb I’ve stayed in.  But I figured that out, obviously.”\nWhen tech fails, locals have stepped in to make him feel at home.\n“During my first visit, my Airbnb host met me at the place I was staying and then took me out for coffee at one of the local bars,” he says. “ She introduced me to the bartender and then an older retired gentleman approached and bought me my cappuccino with a big smile.\n“Franca, my host, said it was his way of saying you’re welcome here. It was very endearing. That describes my first hour in Latronico.”\nMillet is thrilled to have picked up local habits like southern Italy’s languorous and expansive lunches – a far cry from the quick, frugal salads of Los Angeles.\nBut he says he’s had no problem piling it up and stretching his waistline.\n“That’s not too difficult to get used to. I just love just taking a break from the day. Even if your day is a relaxing one. So different from LA.”\nThere are however cons of staying in a sleepy Italian village, he says, but it depends on perspective.\n“A remote village is just that… remote.  That’s a pro for someone looking to get away from it all in a beautiful setting, but a con for someone who wants the action of a larger city.\n“Same thing in terms of activities. If someone wants to stay in a place where there’s a wealth of things to see and do, then a remote village is not necessarily for them. But for someone who wants to get away from the hassles of daily life, then a small village like Latronico is perfect.”\nThat said, he adds, Latronico is strategically located in a part of Italy where one can stay in a quiet village and drive to other areas with interesting sites and things to do, like Greek ruins and beaches.\nTackling the sale process without help on the ground isn’t a piece of cake, warns Millet, who also owns a condominium on the Hawaiian island of Maui.\nRelated gallery\nThis US couple bought a 400-year-old Italian tower\n“Navigating the logistics of buying the house was probably the main challenge. Since I don’t live in Italy, figuring out the negotiations and then, once the price was agreed upon, getting the transaction done was potentially an obstacle.”\nHe was supported throughout the entire process by the village’s housing platform founder, Latronico’s former deputy mayor, Vincenzo Castellano, who acts as an intermediary between foreign buyers and local sellers.\nSo, all in all, the negotiation was pretty painless and once the price was agreed upon. Millet signed a notarized power of attorney in the States to allow Castellano to act on his behalf in filing all the paperwork and project-manage the renovation.\nMillet has advice for foreigners wishing to buy property in small villages: “Do your homework” and visit first, living like a local – even if just for one day.\n“I’m the kind of person who really does a deep dive into anything I consider, so that came naturally for me. All the municipalities have different programs, so get an idea of what each involves. Know it will cost some money to get a home ready to go but it can be incredibly affordable and then you will have it to use as you see fit.”\nAbove all, he says, “Make sure the place speaks to you in person, that you love it.”\n",

        "content": "Suki Sandhu always insists Manuel Heichlinger “made a beeline” for him that first evening in Berlin.\nWhen Manuel entered the Kaefer restaurant, a rooftop spot on top of Germany’s Reichstag parliament building, Suki noticed him right away.\n“I saw him walk in and I thought, ‘He’s quite hot. He’s quite handsome. That must be someone from the German office,’” says Suki. “But I always ignore the hot guy – I’m like, they probably already get enough attention as it is, just ignore them.”\nSuki genuinely had no intention of speaking with Manuel that night. But the next thing he knew, Manuel had unexpectedly made eye contact with him. Then, more unexpected, Manuel was smiling at Suki.\nAnd then – Suki truly couldn’t believe it – Manuel was crossing the room, walking in his direction. Suki held his breath.\nIt was March 2006. Suki was a 25-year-old consultant at a London based recruitment company. In fact, he was the company’s global top consultant. And the organization had a quarterly incentive where they’d whisk the top performers away for a glitzy weekend in a European city.\n“Whoever was successful from the UK was flown out, put up in a five star hotel and there was a whole programme of fun-filled activities,” recalls Suki.\nOne of the activities was the Reichstag banquet dinner. And a bunch of colleagues from the company’s Berlin office were invited along too, among them Manuel Heichlinger, a 28-year-old recent joiner.\nManuel nearly didn’t go that night. The London colleagues were strangers to him. He was feeling a bit rundown, worried a cold might be incoming. But at the last minute he rallied.\n“I thought, ‘It’s a good opportunity.’ Plus, it was in a really fancy restaurant. I was like, ‘Okay, I’ll just go, it’s a free dinner. Let’s do that. And then I can go home early.’ Basically, that was the plan,” Manuel tells CNN Travel today.\nFor what it’s worth, Manuel “totally denies” making a “beeline” towards Suki.\n“I definitely did not make a beeline for him, I just walked in,” says Manuel.\nBut Manuel admits he did notice Suki right away. And he did end up standing by him during the drinks reception – that’s when they first introduced themselves.\n“I thought, ‘Oh he’s cute,’” recalls Manuel. “And then I did make sure I was sitting next to him at the table, that I agree with.”\n“A beeline,” repeats Suki, knowingly.\nThe restaurant was arranged into several long banquet tables. Suki and Manuel sat together, rubbing shoulders, chatting.\nSuki felt like Manuel was being “super attentive”: he was making lots of eye contact, asking Suki lots of questions. Suki wondered if Manuel was gay – and whether Manuel knew that Suki was gay.\nSuki was out, at least he was out to all his colleagues – and to his large group of London friends. But he’d never been open about his sexuality with his family – in Suki’s large Indian Sikh family, sexuality was never talked about.\nSuki had never known how to broach the topic with his family. And then to develop plans together. We love traveling. We already have that. We want to do things together. And so I think it’s a mix of happiness, excitement and just feeling positive about the future.”\n",

        "content": "“I only go to casinos once a year, on Chinese New Year,” says Vivian Lai, a second-generation Macao resident who is training as a nurse. The tradition of gambling is said to bring good luck for the year to come, whether you win or lose.\nMacao, the Chinese special administrative region (SAR) often twinned with Hong Kong, is known as the Las Vegas of Asia. As the only place in greater China where gambling is legal, the city’s skyline is a who’s-who of the biggest names in the gaming industry.\nHome to just 600,000 residents – compared to seven million in Hong Kong – visitors to Macao might feel like the rest of the city lost in the shadow of the towering hotels and casinos. But travelers who are willing to dig in a little deeper can explore Macanese culture, which mixes Portuguese, Chinese and Southeast Asian heritages.\nMacao is comprised of two islands – the north one, Macao itself, and its southern neighbor Taipa. For a long time, Taipa was relatively rural, and people had to travel between the two islands by boat. The first bridge connecting the two was completed in 1972. Now, there are three, with a fourth in construction.\nRelated article\nNot just casinos: Macao reimagines tourism post-pandemic\nWhile the rest of the world may associate Macao with gambling, its citizens don’t necessarily feel the same way.\n“In Asia, [people] think that Macao is full of casinos, and I think they do not understand the other parts of Macao,” says Lai. “When I go to Europe, when I say I come from Macao, actually they don’t know where it is, so I have to say it’s a small city next to Hong Kong.”\nMarina Fernandes agrees. She is an eighth generation Macanese, from one of the oldest families on the island.\nLike a shrinking number of people in her community, she speaks the patua dialect, which mixes Portuguese and Chinese.\n“The locals seldom go to the casinos,” she says. “It’s a very small number of people who really go to the casino to gamble. We don’t gamble. We do other things. And actually the civil servants, they are forbidden to enter [casinos]. The gambling is more for the tourists, it’s not for the locals.”\nDue to rising costs of living in Macao, many employees of the casinos and luxury shops are increasingly likely to commute to work from Zhuhai, the less expensive mainland Chinese city just across the water from Macao, and to speak Mandarin Chinese instead of Cantonese.\nThough Macao’s special status as an SAR means that people traveling between Zhuhai and Macao still have to go through border control, the process is speedier for permanent residents and citizens with Chinese national ID cards thanks to express lanes.\nAccording to Macao’s 2021 census, about five-sixths of Macao’s population is ethnically Chinese. Only a few thousand are Portuguese. While Portuguese is still an official language of the city and must be used on signage and in government literature, many locals opted to learn English or Mandarin Chinese instead, especially ahead of the handover – when Macao was returned to Chinese rule – in 1999.\nMacao’s airport, located on eastern Taipa, is small but modern and easy to navigate. Home to a single terminal, most of its flights are from around the region, with regular connections to places like Singapore, Jakarta, Hanoi, Bangkok and Beijing. However, for longer-haul routes to North America and Europe, locals will have to head to nearby Hong Kong, Shenzhen or Guangzhou.\nThe mammoth Hong Kong-Macao-Zhuhai Bridge, the world’s longest sea-crossing bridge, was completed in 2018. It is just one of many Chinese projects intended to connect and promote the “Greater Bay Area” region.\nDespite the $20 billion bridge, infrastructure within Macao is a different story. Locals who don’t have cars rely mostly on public buses. While Hong Kong has an efficient, well-organized metro system, Macao’s LRT (light rapid transit) system started in 2019 and only has one line so far. Uber suspended its services in Macao in 2017, and taxis only accept cash.\nFernandes spent several years living in Portugal, but says she felt alienated there and decided to return to Macao.\n“We learned the Portuguese history. We know every city of Portugal. We sang proudly the Portuguese anthem,” says Fernandes. “Especially after the handover, they do not know us. They do not understand us, that we feel Portuguese.”\nShe says that the stereotypes she encountered about Macao involved gambling, triad gangs, and prostitution, as well as old cliches about Chinese people like that women still wore traditional qipao dresses and that men had the single braid or ponytail hairstyle.\nNow retired and her children grown, Fernandes has devoted her life to preserving and highlighting native Macanese culture. She works at the Associação dos Macaense (Macanese Association) and has opened the canteen there to the public so that more people can try traditional Macanese dishes like minchi (ground meat, usually pork, stir-fried with potatoes and soy sauce). Her next goal is to open a commercial restaurant catering to tourists.\nDue to its small size, Macao is strict about working policies for foreigners.\nRicardo Balocas, a Lisbon native who moved to Macao in 2013, has held a variety of jobs since relocating from Europe, including management roles at the Macao International Airport and at St. Joseph’s University, the only Catholic four-year university in Asia.\nMost foreigners – like Balocas – who move to Macao are eligible for permanent residency after seven years of living, working and paying taxes. That means that they can live in Macao without a work visa and do not need a company sponsoring them.\nResidents with local ID cards are also able to use the city’s socialized health care. Macao citizens and permanent residents get an annual perk in the form of 10,000 patacas ($1,240) a year from the government.\nHowever, the rules are different for many of the workers who come from poorer parts of the world, namely the Philippines. Many Filipinos come to Macao to work as domestic helpers or as security guards in casinos and luxury shops, but they cannot qualify for permanent residency or citizenship – unless they get married to a local.\nAccording to the annual Henley Passport Index, which ranks passports by how many destinations their holders can visit visa-free, Macao has the 33rd most powerful passport in the world, and Portugal is tied for the fifth best. Meanwhile, the Philippines’ passport is ranked 75th.\nRelated article\n‘Like the tart, I never change’: The secret behind Macao’s most famous dessert\nBalocas estimates that about half of Macao’s expat Portuguese population left during the pandemic, as Macao had some of the strictest requirements in the world, including a 21-day quarantine.\nThat’s why he counts on places like Albergue 1601, a restaurant housed in a heritage building from the colonial eral, to keep the city’s Portuguese heritage alive.\n“This neighborhood has the lamps in the street exactly the same as in Lisbon,” he says. “So if you walk around, you almost feel that you are in Lisbon. Sometimes I even joke that you can come here and take some pictures and say that you are in Lisbon without being in Lisbon.”\nHowever, Balocas says that whether you love or hate casinos, it is impossible to ignore them. He sometimes joins a poker game on his day off: “I like to play against people, not machines.”\nHe cites a recent government program that “pairs” casinos with specific local streets and shops and encourages their guests to go there and spend money, as a positive move forward. In his opinion, getting hotel guests to venture outside into Macao – which is densely packed and easy to navigate on foot – helps the whole community.\n“What I want people to explore when they come to Macao, it’s to get out from the casinos, honestly,” says Balocas. “There is a lot to explore. We have beautiful museums, beautiful neighborhoods.”\nThese days, Balocas is working at a hospitality group, managing Albergue 1601.\nWhen he has friends or family in town, he says, the first stop is the Macao Tower observation deck, so they can see just how small and compact the city is.\n“Even nowadays that I’m 11 years here, sometimes I like to get lost. Don’t just explore the center, explore the alleys.”\n",

        "content": "Editor’s Note: This CNN Travel series is, or was, sponsored by the country it highlights. CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy.\nTurkey is rich with ancient wonders. Straddling Europe and Asia, the country has been at the heart of numerous empires, which have left behind archaeological attractions to rival its many natural wonders.\nBut not everything sits above ground, basking in Turkish sunshine.\nLess obviously visible but equally impressive are the historical treasures, some more than 12,000 years old, that can be found underground.\nSome are well known. Istanbul’s Basilica Cistern, a columned reservoir that dates back to Roman times, has been open to tourists for decades and featured in movies including the James Bond classic “From Russia with Love.”\nOthers may not be as famous, but are no less spectacular or fascinating.\nHere are some of the best subterranean marvels that the country has to offer:\nLike the Basilica, this elegant cistern was built during late Roman times to ensure a supply of water to Constantinople, as Istanbul was once known.\nUnlike the Basilica, this underground chamber was completely forgotten about until less than 15 years ago.\nThe Şerefiye Cistern, was constructed during the reign of Theodosius II, ruler of the Eastern Roman - or Byzantine - Empire from 402 to 450 CE in what is now Istanbul’s Fatih district.\nIt was constructed to store fresh water brought from Belgrade Forest, a wilderness near the Black Sea north of the city, via a 155-mile-long canal network that included the ancient Aqueduct of Valens, which still stands in Fatih. The water was then distributed to citizens.\nAt 82 by 147 feet (25 by 45 meters), with a ceiling almost 36 feet high, walls eight feet thick and 32 marble columns, the structure – also known as the Theodosius Cistern – is as substantial as it is beautiful.\nRelated article\nThe stunning 30-hour train ride that sells out in minutes\nYet sometime around the late 18th or early 19th century its existence was completely forgotten after a large private estate was built on the site, and it lay hidden for many years.\nThe Istanbul municipality took over the buildings in the early 20th century, but it was only in 2010 when some unloved additions were demolished that the cistern’s underground entryway was rediscovered.\nThe 1,600-year-old water depot opened to the public in 2018. Inside, the columns topped with Corinthian capitals shimmer with a brilliant gleam, the highly polished brass rings reflecting the color and movement of installations and cultural events.\nEntering this cistern, the thick walls provide a cocoon from the outside world. The cacophony of the street above is replaced by the sounds of rippling water.\nWhen archaeological excavations began at Dara in 1986, it was a small settlement on a green, windswept plain about 19 miles (30 kilometers) outside the historic city of Mardin in southeast Turkey.\nOther than locals herding their livestock through the ruins of a garrison city dating to the 6th century, few people went there.\nNow, the site has given up numerous treasures including rock-cut tombs, an olive processing workshop and a series of underground cisterns.\nOne of them is so large that locals believed it was a zindan, a dungeon. They told fanciful tales of prisoners chained up for years, dependent on weak shafts of sunlight to calculate the passage of time.\nIn reality the cisterns stored water flowing down from the mountains for use by the locals and Roman soldiers stationed in Dara.\nBack in 1963 a Turkish farmer noticed his chickens kept going missing then reappeared as if by magic. Eager to solve the mystery he followed their tracks to a crack in the tufa, the volcanic rock that also forms Cappadocia’s peribaca fairy chimneys, and found the opening to an 18-story-deep cave system.\nDerinkuyu, “the deep well” as it translates in English, was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1985. It once provided safe haven for up to 20,000 people. Now tourists can take the same steps used by Christians fleeing Arab raiders hundreds of years ago.\nFresh air enters via deep air shafts, but despite this the atmosphere in Derinkuyu is close and becomes more humid as the route descends 328 feet (100 meters.)\nIn places the path ducks under low-hanging rock and twists back on itself. Fragments of conversation echo off the walls while the murky figures of other cave explorers appear in the distance.\nTraversing the eight floors open to the public, filled with the remains of churches, stables, wine presses and empty grave sites, history merges with the present.\nRelated article\nInside Turkey’s ‘hidden’ ski world\nThe elegant structures lining Istanbul’s popular pedestrian thoroughfare Istiklal Caddesi once housed corset-makers, carpet dealers and private clubs frequented by émigrés who had fled revolutionary Russia.\nIn ornate buildings like Rümeli Han, the who’s who of Istanbul came to dine and artists, actors and singers took center stage. Whether they used the mysterious tunnels, which lay undiscovered beneath it for years, only coming to light in 2017, is anyone’s guess.\nRümeli Han was built in 1894 for Sarıcazade Ragıp Pasha, Sultan Abdülhamid II’s head steward. Renovation work on the building began just over five years ago, at which point its subterranean secrets were revealed.\nThe tunnel is now open to the public, a rather mundane sign taped to the building’s elegant marble facade announces its presence.\nDown inside, tightly laid ochre-colored clay bricks block out the world above. Set at regular intervals along the walls, windowless rooms lead one into the other, ending at stairwells, now locked, that go back up to street level.\nNo one’s exactly sure of the purpose of the tunnels. Perhaps the elite used this underground pathway to move unseen from one assignation to another.\nFrom a distance, solid grey dry stone walls and a rectangular tower, the minaret, are all that is visible of the post-modern Sancaklar Mosque, located in a remote suburb on the outskirts of Istanbul.\nBut underneath is something that looks like it’s from another world entirely.\nOutside, the building is as much rooted in the past as the future. Scant vegetation ripples in the breeze and in the distance utilitarian apartment blocks march along the horizon. The dry stone suggests the boundaries of a farm while a surface pattern of parallel lines radiating down a gentle slope is reminiscent of ancient archaeological sites.\nThe interior, however, is a calm, womb-like space. The only decoration is rough-hewn masonry and slabs of reinforced concrete.\nIt’s an unusual but beautiful space. Every seat on the arcs of the building’s amphitheater has a clear line of sight to the mihrab, the part of the mosque that indicates the direction of Mecca. Here, rather than a traditional elaborately carved wall niche, the mirhab takes the form of a single beam of light.\nUnlike conventional designs, Sancaklar has no main dome, or any dome at all. Overhead, a tranquil sweep of smooth concrete lines in the style of a Zen garden reinforces the sense of peace.\nSancaklar Mosque is both impressive and formidable. Completed in 2012, it’s the architectural realization of the constant tension of the manmade and the natural, and our place in between.\nA space-age dome located not far outside Şanlıurfa in southeastern Turkey strikes a discordant note in the natural tapestry blooming on the rolling hills surrounding it. Archaeologically speaking, what it protects is even more disconcerting.\nInside the dome, visitors gaze down at huge stone stele – T-shaped columns weighing around five tonnes each, with carvings of wild animals on the sides.\nThey date to the pre-Pottery Neolithic Age. That’s around 9600-8200 BCE. In 2018, UNESCO recognized Göbeklitepe as the first manifestation of human-made monumental architecture in history. In comparison, Stonehenge, everyone’s must-see megalithic structure from 3000-2500 BCE, seems positively juvenile.\nAge aside, the discovery of this place of worship in 1994 turned archaeology on its head. Experts believe the T-shaped pillars were erected by hunter-gatherers for use as a place of worship, a practice previously only associated with settled agricultural communities.\nLooking at them in situ, it’s hard to picture anyone, human or otherwise, moving these enormous stones into place.\nTo better understand physically what creating Göbeklitepe entailed and to experience its scale and majesty from the ground up, it’s worth taking a wander through the full-scale replica in the Şanlıurfa Archaeology Museum.\nRelated article\nDatça: The beautiful Turkish peninsula forgotten by time\nSqueezed between buildings near the mouth of the Golden Horn, Yeraltı Mosque on a small street in Karaköy, Istanbul, is easy to overlook. An unassuming door opens into a simple interior design based on repetition and clean lines.\nHere, 42 squat piers run in parallel rows. Even on the warmest days the interior remains cool due to seven-foot-thick walls and the cold seeping up through the red carpet.\nAn eerie green glow emanates from the far end, but other than that, at first glance this mosque doesn’t seem to offer much in the way of interest.\nLooks can be deceiving.\nYeraltı, literally meaning underground, was originally a dungeon in the basement of a fort built by the Byzantines in the 8th century CE.\nIt was also the northern anchor point for an enormous chain stretched across to Istanbul’s ancient Topkapı Palace – once the seat of power for the Ottoman Empire – on the other side of the waterway aimed at stopping Turkish ships from entering and attacking the city. Like many a best-laid plan, it failed, allowing Fatih Sultan Mehmet to conquer the city in 1453.\nIn the following centuries, the fort was damaged, remodelled, repurposed and finally converted into a mosque by Grand Vizier Bahir Mustafa Paşa in 1757.\nAnd that weird glow? In 1640, a Nakşibendi dervish dreamt the bodies of two Arab soldiers thought to have participated in the failed siege of Constantinople in the 7th century were buried here.\nDuring the month of Ramadan it’s traditional for people to come and pray at their tombs, illuminated by bright neon, giving this usually quiet mosque an incongruously festive air.\nLisa Morrow is a freelance writer and sociologist living in Istanbul, Turkey. Her writing has been published in The New York Times, Guardian UK, BBC Travel, World Nomads, Fodors and Hyperallergic. She’s also the author of five books, the latest being “Istanbul 50 Unsung Places, an alternative guide to the city.”\n",

        "content": "Retired public relations professional Bonnie Sashin and her husband had just spent a nice Thanksgiving visit and meal with family at her stepson’s suburban home in the Connecticut city of Fairfield, a charming burg of about 61,000 on Long Island Sound.\nBy the time they departed the 2022 family gathering, the sun had already set, Sashin recalls.\nThey cranked up her fairly new Subaru Forester SUV to head to a nearby hotel, where they were staying the night rather than make the two-and-a-half hour drive back to Brookline, Massachusetts, on full stomachs and in full darkness.\n“And just as we turned the corner, practically out of the subdivision where my stepson lives … I can feel something hit the car. You know, it’s dark, and I had no idea what could it be. And I was just very alarmed,” Sashin said.\n“My husband thought it was some kind of animal, and we of course stopped and fortunately a nice, civic-minded woman in front of us stopped. … She got out of the car. She saw me. She was really nice. She said, ‘Oh, that was a deer.’ And she said, ‘It happens all the time around here.’“\nIt turns out that deer-vehicle collisions are far more than a southern Connecticut problem. They’re a problem across much of the United States and in other nations. It also turns out Sashin was fortunate not to have been injured or even killed in the incident.\nEven people who realize how common deer-vehicle collisions are might be surprised at these startling stats for the United States from this November 2022 study in the journal Cell Biology:\n• Around 2.1 million deer-vehicle collisions occur annually.\n• The collisions cause more than $10 billion in economic losses annually.\n• Each year, they account for some 59,000 human injuries and 440 human deaths.\nRelated article\nHow to survive a rattlesnake bite – or better yet, avoid one\nKip Adams, chief conservation officer with the National Deer Association, notes that deer are much more deadly to Americans each year than those scary movie and TV threats – sharks, alligators, bears and venomous snakes – combined. (For instance, there were just two deaths in the United States by shark attack in 2023.)\nLooks like we should be much more wary of Bambi than of Jaws.\nAnd the United States is not alone in having a deer problem. For instance, a 2023 study from Scotland’s nature agency, NatureScot, estimated that 700 people are injured or killed in deer-vehicle collisions in the United Kingdom annually.\nThey grapple with the deer problem in such far-flung places as British Columbia, Japan, Australia and Germany, too.\nSo what can drivers do to protect themselves from unwanted encounters with these herbivores?\nAdams says your best shield against a deer collision isn’t a fancy gadget but knowledge.\n“The first step in helping to minimize hitting one is to be aware of when they are most active,” he told CNN Travel in a phone interview. “Two things that play into that. … One is when they’re most active daily and then also when they are most active annually.”\nAs for the daily factor, sunrise and sunset should be high-alert times for drivers, Adams said. Why is that?\n“Deer are what’s known as crepuscular – crepuscular means most active at dawn and dusk,” Adams said. “The way their eyes are built, they can do the best job avoiding predators and collecting what they need when they move in low-light situations – that being dusk and that being dawn.”\nBut “that’s not our peak vision time. So those two things together – more activity at a time when we can’t see as good – really play into increased deer-vehicle collisions at those times,” Adams said.\nChad Stewart, a deer, elk and moose management specialist with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, concurs.\n“I would say the hour on either side of both sunrise and sunset are the greatest times when a collision can occur,” he said in an email interview with CNN Travel. “This is partly due to deer’s activity around that time, but also because of heavy traffic patterns during those hours.”\nBut collisions can occur anytime around the clock, Adams cautions.\nRelated article\nHow to survive rip currents and other drowning hazards\nCollisions can also happen any time of year – after all, deer don’t hibernate, Adams points out. But two times of year are typically more high risk.\nAdams said the first one is spring. That’s fawning time, and “deer are way more active around roads,” he said.\n“When a doe is having her fawn, the does become extremely territorial of those areas. … What happens is deer get spread out a lot more on the landscape, which means that they’re more apt to, you know, be near a road.”\nBut autumn is the season most fraught with danger, Adams said, “and the majority of that occurs in November. During that time, deer greatly increase their daily movement patterns,” he said, especially the bucks.\nResearch from State Farm insurance company also highlights November as the most likely month of the year to have a collision with an animal.\nAs Bonnie Sashin’s collision in a Connecticut suburb illustrates, you don’t have to be out in wilderness to collide with a deer.\n“Typically, suburban areas can hold higher densities of deer, and with more miles driven by vehicles occurring in these areas compared to rural areas, total number of collisions tends to be highest in these areas,” Stewart cautioned.\n“But with that being said, any place has the potential for a collision.  Especially where habitat transitions occur (e.g. forest to field), which are commonly used locations for deer.”\nAdams said be on extra guard where the woods come out close to the road, where “we have very little opportunity of seeing those deer prior to them being in front of a vehicle.”\nThe suburbs are also a big problem, he said, “because it’s extremely difficult to manage deer populations in those areas. We can’t go in there in most cases and hunt like we do in more rural areas.”\nSome US states have a bigger problem with deer-vehicle collisions than others.\nState Farm compiles annual statistics assessing the risk in each state. While the insurance company’s statistics cover all animal-vehicle collisions, deer account for the majority of them.\nSeventeen states are considered “high risk” for an animal-vehicle collision, according to the latest State Farm report for 2023-24.\nTopping the list is West Virginia, where drivers have a 1 in 38 annual risk of being in an animal-involved claim, State Farm says.\nThat’s not surprising to Adams. The Mountain State is filled with forests, has a high deer population and lacks much in the way of dense urban areas.\n“They have a lot of winding roads through wooded areas which further reduces the visibility. A lot of factors play together there that definitely put West Virginia at the top,” Adams said.\nRounding out the top 5 states are:\nNo. 2: Montana (1 in 53 chance)No. 3: Pennsylvania (1 in 59 chance)No. 4: Michigan (1 in 60 chance)No. 5: Wisconsin (1 in 60 chance)\nYour best bets to avoid colliding with an animal: Nevada, where State Farm says the chance is just 1 in 770, and Hawaii (1 in 710 chance).\nOnce you’re better aware of when and where the collision risk is highest, then it’s time to put driving strategies into place.\n“Basic safe driving principles apply to reduce your chance at a collision.  First and foremost, avoid distracted driving,” Stewart said. Also, slow down in areas known to have high deer numbers so you can “have better reaction should one jump out in front of your vehicle.”\nAdams said use your high beams whenever possible in deer territory – but don’t blind oncoming traffic.\nStewart’s not sold on gadget remedies.\n“Using things like car mounted whistles are not proven to reduce or prevent collisions from occurring, so saving your money and not falling into a false sense of security with these items is advisable.”\nHowever, do make good use of your car horn, advises the National Deer Association in this YouTube video.\nSome other tips from the Michigan State Police:\n• Deer typically follow one another in single file, so if you see one deer, there are likely more nearby.• Look for the reflection of headlights in a deer’s eyes and deer silhouettes on the shoulder of the road.• Scan the roadside while driving, especially around wooded lots, fencerows, field edges and areas near water.\nUnfortunately, some drivers despite all their caution are going to have to make a split-second decision – and fight a natural impulse – when there’s a deer ahead in the road.\n“We have a campaign in Michigan called ‘Don’t veer for deer.’ The reason this phrase is used is because while nobody wants to hit a deer, there can be far worse consequences by swerving to avoid a deer and hitting something else, like a telephone pole or another car,” Stewart said.\n“Sometimes, collisions with deer simply can’t be avoided. But the important thing is to not make it worse for you or somebody else by abruptly and erratically leaving your lane.”\nAdams dispenses the same advice with a fatherly touch.\n“I have a 17-year-old daughter. I talk to her about this all the time. Try to avoid the deer but do not swerve because your chances of having a bad accident are much higher,” he said.\n“It’s way better to hit a deer with the front of your car going straight where that car is built to withstand an impact than it is to swerve and go off the road” and possibly hit a tree or another vehicle, Adams said.\nCollisions account for the vast majority of interactions that result in injuries or deaths to people, Adams said, but they aren’t the only ways people can be hurt by these generally docile grazers.\nThough incidents are very rare, he said deer that have been raised in captivity and have lost their fear of humans can end up hurting the hands that fed them.\nRelated article\nHow to survive a bear attack – or better yet, avoid one altogether\n“You can find accounts where … somebody got attacked by a deer, like literally attacked. In almost every case, that was a captive animal that had been hand reared.”\nSeveral years ago, a Colorado woman was cited for illegally raising a young deer that attacked and gored one of her neighbors, according to state wildlife officials.\nIn 2023, a Florida man’s pet deer was euthanized on the scene by officials after the animal attacked one of his neighbors.\nAlso in 2023, a man on vacation in Greece approached too closely to a deer for a selfie. The deer rammed him and broke some of his ribs.\nThe Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission warns people not to feed deer and to treat them with the respect wild creatures deserve.\nHunting is the other time where human-deer interactions can go wrong.\nIn 2019, an experienced Arkansas hunter was found severely injured in the woods, his body riddled with antler puncture wounds from a deer he had shot but had not killed. He later died. Experts say hunters should wait 15 to 30 minutes before approaching a shot deer to make sure it is dead.\nHowever, the biggest danger in deer hunting is other people, Adams said.\n“Hunting is very safe, and it has gotten way safer over the past couple of decades with hunter safety programs, but accidents still do happen. And it’s very clear that the most dangerous person in the woods to you, if you’re hunting, is the person you walked in the woods with.”\nAgain, awareness is key, Adams said.\n“I have a family camp in northern Pennsylvania. We have a lot of friends and family that hunt that we share our land with. … If we are going out as a group to hunt deer, bear, whatever … I have a little safety talk and tell everybody, ‘Hey, let’s be careful today.’ “\nBonnie Sashin’s Thanksgiving night collision with a deer happened in a flash. But the repercussions took a while to sort out. The Good Samaritan who stopped in front of her was quite helpful, she said.\n“First thing she said to me – which was the best piece of advice for us because no one was hurt – was call the police … because you’re gonna want a record for your insurance company.”\nRelated article\n‘I was up to my waist down a hippo’s throat.’ He survived, and here’s his advice\nSashin said she later learned about a friend who collided with a deer and didn’t call the police right away – and the adjuster gave her a hard time.\nThe front fender of Sashin’s new car was bashed in, but she and her husband were able to drive her SUV back to Massachusetts, where they learned the vehicle could be repaired vs. being totaled.\n“I went in to my body shop where I know the guy, his name is Paul. … He said, ‘Bonnie, get in line. You know how many cars I have that have been hit by deer in the last week?’ ” There were five or six ahead of hers, he told her.\n“The pain in the butt part is that you gotta wait a long time these days with a body shop. … It’s very hard to get parts.” She had to wait until February to get her SUV repaired.\nSashin and her husband continue to drive to family trips in the Northeast, but they try to be off the road before dark these days.\nDespite everything, she’s grateful they weren’t hurt or the vehicle totaled. “I came away lucky.”\n",

        "content": "Mike Tyson is clearly taking his fight with Jake Paul seriously as he detailed elements of his training regime, which he says includes not smoking marijuana as well as abstaining from sex.\nTyson, 57, will return to the ring to face YouTuber-turned-boxer Paul at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas on July 20. Tyson will be 58 when the fight takes place.\n“Two and a half weeks, I haven’t smoked,” Tyson told “The Damon Elliott Show.” “And I haven’t had sex for two and a half weeks.” Tyson was pictured with Elliott in an April 12 post on the latter’s Instagram, with the caption saying: “Thanks for coming to my show today!”\nHowever, in a separate interview with Forbes Life on April 20, Tyson said his regime of abstinence had been longer, saying: “Probably for six weeks I haven’t gotten high or had sex.”\n“I’m living my life disciplined now, so I’m going to have to fight disciplined now,” he added.\nMarijuana is on the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation’s (TDLR) banned substances list. The TDLR governs combat sport in the state.\nCNN has reached out to Tyson for comment.\nOn Monday, the TDLR told CNN that it had approved a professional bout with certain waivers, meaning the fight will last for eight rounds, with two minutes a round and both boxers wearing 14-ounce gloves.\n“Iron Mike” last fought professionally in June 2005 and boasts a 50-6 career record, with 44 of his victories coming by way of knockout. The former world heavyweight champion is widely considered one of the best boxers in history.\nHe last fought in 2020, coming out of retirement to face Roy Jones Jr. in an exhibition match which ended in a controversial split draw.\nIn the lead up to the fight against Paul at the 80,000-seat capacity AT&T Stadium, home of the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys, Tyson showed his effort to get into fighting shape after years out of the ring, notably shedding his top during multiple appearances to show off his physique.\nThe 27-year-old Paul has transitioned from YouTube to professional boxing and has won nine of his 10 fights. His only defeat came against Tommy Fury, the younger half-brother of heavyweight champion Tyson Fury, in February 2023.\nSmoking marijuana has been a constant in Tyson’s life ever since he first tried it from a young age, the 57-year-old says in the interview with Forbes Life.\nHis victory over Andrew Golota in 2000 was voided after Tyson’s boxing license in Michigan was suspended and fined following a post-fight urine sample that tested positive for marijuana.\nThe 57-year-old has also started his own cannabis brand, Tyson 2.0, with Forbes estimating it generated $150 million in revenue last year.\nThe brand sells edibles in the shape of Evander Holyfield’s half-bitten ear, a nod to the controversial 1997 fight between the two heavyweights, as well as other products named after Tyson’s successful boxing career. The edible was part of a joint venture alongside Holyfield.\nTyson credits his wife, Lakiha Spicer, for coming up with the idea of selling products to recognize that moment in the fight against Holyfield – he later served a one-year boxing ban. The edibles are named ‘Mike Bites.’\n“My wife is a nut, but she’s brilliant,” Tyson told Forbes. “And [one day] she said: ‘Why don’t you use the ear?’”\nAlthough Tyson described the incident as “the worst night of my professional career as a boxer, “it has proven to be a lucrative business moment.\n“Why did God, the universe, whatever we believe, why am I the face of it?” Tyson said. “An uneducated guy, Mike Tyson, why am I the face of cannabis and psychedelics? Why me? I can’t even spell cannabis and psychedelics.”\nTyson added: “I was the champ of the world and now I’m the champ in cannabis.”\n",

        "content": "Soccer is becoming firmly entrenched in mainstream pop culture with hit television shows like “Ted Lasso” and “Welcome to Wrexham,” the documentary series detailing Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney’s ownership of the Welsh soccer club, introducing the sport to new audiences in the US and abroad – as Chris Ewing is quickly discovering.\nOn any given evening, Ewing receives emails informing him that some fan in a far-flung location – say, Los Angeles – has just invested in his tiny Scottish soccer club, the Caledonian Braves.\n“Then 10 minutes later, there would be someone from Australia invest in the club and it’s just like, ‘Wow, I can’t believe it,’” Ewing, the club’s founder, tells CNN Sport.\nNestled in the leafy outskirts of Motherwell, a town about 20 kilometers southeast of Glasgow, the Caledonian Braves play in the Scottish fifth division with a team of mostly amateur players at a ground with capacity for just 500 fans.\nBut, despite its small home, Ewing’s vision of creating a fan-owned club, steeped in values of diversity and community with ambitions of reaching the Scottish Premier League, has attracted more than $300,000 in investment from more than 1,000 owners around the world, far outstripping the annual running costs of about $58,000, he says.\nAmong those owners include an NBA player, an NBA coach and a players’ union executive as well as soccer players in the US’ National Women Super League (NWSL). Investors in 49 US states have bought in – Wyoming is the only state pending on the list, he says.\n“A community club, most people would think, is a local community bound by a certain geography,” says Ewing.\n“But I think that today when we have internet, we have social media, we have an app as well that promotes fan engagement, I feel like a community can be just shared ideals and shared values, and it can be global.”\nVisiting Scotland and learning about the country’s history was an “amazing” experience for Mujtaba Elgoodah, one of the club’s lead investors, he remembers.\nMore used to basketball than soccer, Elgoodah was the manager of team development for the Golden State Warriors when they won the 2022 NBA title and is now part of the National Basketball Players’ Association executive leadership team.\nBut, when braving the bitterly cold Scottish weather to visit the club in February, he discovered “there is nothing like a good football match,” Elgoodah tells CNN Sport.\n“Just seeing the intensity and even picking up different slang words that the crowd was throwing out there was amazing too,” he adds.\nElgoodah had been intrigued by the Braves’ story and ethos when he happened across their story on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, last year.\nHe set about assembling a group of investors who could appreciate both soccer’s potential for growth and the importance of community alongside his longtime investment partner Nassir Criss, a serial entrepreneur and venture capitalist.\nTogether, they involved NWSL’s Kansas City Current stars Elizabeth Ball, Kristen Hamilton and Hailie Mace with their wealth of soccer knowledge, and introduced Boston Celtics performance coach Isaiah Covington to Ewing after he had also noticed the club’s story on social media.\n“I didn’t grow up around soccer,” Covington recalls. “But in the last few years, I have a host of nieces and nephews and that’s all they play now.”\nThough still nowhere near as popular as American football or basketball, soccer is the fastest-growing sport in the US and the most popular choice for adults under the age of 30. As a high school sport alone, it has grown by almost 300% in the last 40 years.\n“You see … all these celebrities owning football clubs, it’s kind of the new wave that people are on,” Hamilton says.\n“And so I think that that’s been a really huge, powerful movement in the US saying, ‘Hey, you know, we can’t own an NFL team, but we can own a small football team.’”\nWith its idea for lots of small investors helping it achieve huge ambitions, the Braves embodies an American style “entrepreneurial spirit,” Criss tells CNN Sport.\n“How do we take something new that no one’s ever really heard of, this wee club with massive ambitions to being a global franchise and pour in resources, community, people to actually accelerate that on a very big scale,” he says.\nAs more and more money pours into soccer, the gap between fans and owners has become a cavern at many clubs. In the battle for soccer’s soul, the two groups are often pitted against each other – the fans as representing the history and traditions of the sport, the owners cast as turning clubs into commercial entities or vehicles for sportswashing.\nAgainst this backdrop, fan ownership has emerged as somewhat of a utopian panacea for some fans.\nWhile it is still an unusual model in the UK, particularly in the English Premier League and Championship where clubs operate at huge losses, the Braves are not the first to pursue this goal.\nThey were set up as a company limited by shares in 2022 meaning that fans can buy into it, and expect to file their first set of accounts in October. Ewing founded a previous attempt at this ownership model from 2019 to 2021 but dissolved it before ever trading, he says.\nIn Scotland, fans have become majority owners at topflight clubs St Mirren, Motherwell and Heart of Midlothian in recent years while several others, including Rangers and Celtic, count fans among their minority owners.\nIn German soccer culture, meanwhile, the 50+1 concept of fan majority ownership is deeply entrenched thereby giving fans more of a say in the running of clubs, a model Ewing says he hopes to eventually emulate.\nBut fan ownership isn’t easy, namely working out how to marshal hundreds of opinions into some sort of coherent opinion.\nEwing, who doesn’t take a salary from the club, admits that managing expectations has proved challenging “because people think they can just say, okay, let’s do x, y, z.”\n“With the best intentions in the world, it’s maybe not as easy as that, but I think as well, the big thing for me is that people get to love the highs and the lows.”\nThe Braves have an app and Discord channel, helping to foster this sense of community and allowing fan owners to have a voice on the direction of the club. Fans picked the club’s name, logo and the name of its ground – Alliance Park.\nAllowing fans this ownership over the team is proving infectious, its investors are finding.\n“Anytime I ever post about the Braves … people will DM me and be like, “’Who’s this team … and how do I get involved?’” Ball says.\nSuch a project is a marked difference from Ewing’s original venture, Edusport Academy, which he established in 2011, intending to provide a place for promising young soccer players, mostly from France, to hone their craft and learn English.\nAs time went by, the academy’s first team started playing in the Scottish soccer leagues and separated to form the Caledonian Braves in 2019.\nNow, as the Braves continue to grow, it has set its sights on rising up through the leagues but in a sustainable way that preserves the club for years to come.\n“(We’re) flipping the narrative that you don’t have to be Tom Brady or Matthew McConaughey or Ryan Reynolds,” says Ewing. “You can be anyone really from anywhere and you can also own a football club for as little as $100.”\n",

        "publishedAt": "4:35 AM EDT, Fri April 26, 2024",
        "content": "Aya Nakamura was born in the former French colony of Mali, raised in France and is widely considered the most streamed female Francophone artist in the world.\nThe 28-year-old, as well as being Malian, is a French citizen, and a multiple-platinum-selling pop star who was brought up in the Parisian suburbs. However, ahead of Paris 2024, Nakamura finds herself at the center of France’s culture wars.\nAmid widespread rumors the singer would perform at the Games’ Opening Ceremony, singing an Edith Piaf song, some members of France’s far-right have questioned whether she embodies French heritage, values and identity. Piaf is a key figure in France’s musical – and national – identity.\n“There’s no way Aya. This is Paris, not the market in Bamako,” said fringe and extreme far-right group Les Natifs (Natives) on X, formerly known as Twitter, in March, referring to Mali’s capital.\nNakamura has defended herself on social media, saying on X: “I’m becoming the number one state subject in debates …but what do I really owe you all? Nothing.”\nThe singer has received support from Rachida Dati, France’s Minister of Culture, who spoke out in defence of Nakamura, saying “be careful of the pretext of attacking someone out of pure racism.”\nParis 2024’s organizing committee told CNN: “We were very shocked by the racist attacks against Aya Nakamura in recent days. We offer our full support to the most listened-to French artist in the world.”\nWhether Nakamura will perform at the Olympics’ opening ceremony is still unconfirmed, with the Paris 2024 organizing committee telling CNN that they “won’t be confirming or denying” any rumors or reports, to “leave room for surprises” on the day.\nCNN has reached out to Nakamura but she declined to be interviewed on the matter.\nHowever, many others in France are all too keen to comment on this cause célèbre.\nFar-right politician Marion Maréchal, who is the niece of far-right National Rally party leader Marine Le Pen and a member of the Reconquête party, told French television stations BMFTV and Europe 1 that Nakamura “does not sing in French,” referencing the blend of Parisian and African derived slang that often feature in her lyrics.\n“I think that the people who criticize her actually don’t accept that she embodies France,” French activist Rokhaya Diallo told CNN. “The slang she uses is used by young people and a lot of young French people use slang.”\nNakamura often uses a mix of verlan and African derived slang from languages such as Bambara, from her birth country Mali, in her music. Her number one hit song “Djadja,” contains the lyric “le monde est tit-pe” – the world is small – with word ‘tit-pe’ inverting the French word ‘petit.’\nVerlan, a type of French slang named after the inversion of the French word ‘l’envers’ – meaning backwards – originates from the outskirts of Paris known as ‘la cité’ (the suburbs) that have had large immigrant population.\nAt the inauguration of the Olympic Aquatics Centre earlier this month, French President Emanuel Macron said that Nakamura “speaks to a good number of our compatriots” and claimed that “these games and ceremonies should reflect us, and she contributes to French culture, to French music.”\n“I want to defend here these choices and defend the fact that there must be artistic freedom and that politics should not interfere,” added Macron.\nIn an interview with France Inter, Macron’s political rival Le Pen, known for her right-wing views, claimed that the President was seeking to “outrage” and “humiliate the French people” when asked whether she thinks Nakamura opening the games would be a good symbol.\nWhen asked to further explain why this choice would be a humiliation, Le Pen responded “she does not sing in French, or a foreign language, she sings nonsense.”\nSpeaking to CNN, Professor of Political Science at the University of Nice, Vincent Martigny, said that while there are those who believe it is right to promote minorities and their role in French culture, there are others, who hold more traditional views, which he terms as racist in relation to the country’s colonial past.\nThere have been moments of perceived unity in France’s past, notably when the men’s national soccer team won the 1998 World Cup.\nThat triumph helped popularise the slogan “Black, Blanc, Beur” – Black, White, Arab  – amid a push for unity and inclusion. Beur’ is verlan for the French word ‘arabe.’\nFrance’s World Cup winning team of 1998 was made up of a diverse group of players, not only of European descent but also from the ex-colonies of France and other countries. Many thought at the time that the 1998 team was a sign of a truly integrated, multi-cultural France.\nBut notable social and cultural divisions have emerged in France in recent years.\nThere have been multiple bans and restrictions against Islamic dress. The nationwide ban on public schoolchildren wearing abayas, was denounced as an “Islamophobic campaign” by one politician on the left. Athletes have been banned from wearing a hijab while competing representing France at the Paris Olympic Games.\nThen there have been multiple protests and riots over police brutality leading to the death of some French inhabitants of North and West African heritage from the suburbs of Paris, fueling backlash over policing methods in marginalized communities.\nNakamura’s birth country of Mali is one of the many former French colonies. There are millions of French citizens, like Nakamura, who are either themselves immigrants or descendants of immigrants from nations formerly colonized by France.\nThese days France finds itself embroiled in a very public debate over the recognition and acceptance of its immigrants as the country continues to reckon with its colonial history.\nProfessor Martigny believes that the nationalist party is “stronger than ever” and that nationalists in France are “more nationalist” and more open with their views today than they were in the past.\nActivist Diallo also believes that France is struggling to see itself “as it is” and recognize non-White individuals as fully French.\n“Despite her successes, despite her undeniable achievements, we still think that it’s not an honor for us to have such a woman represent us,” Diallo told CNN, referring to Nakamura.\nPolitical scientist Oliver Roy, who is Professor at the EUI School of Transnational Governance, told CNN that a common belief that could be fuelling the culture wars in France is an ideology expressed “not just [by] the extreme right, but also part of the traditional centre right” known as “the great replacement.”\nHe describes the term as “the idea that there is a new population coming from the south, which is replacing the old traditional, French population.” However, he maintains that this fear “is not supported by demography, [or] by statistics, and is, of course, very ideological.”\nAccording to Martigny, France’s cultural divisions are amplified on social media by both extremes of the political spectrum.\n“Because of the social networks, public debates are more violent on these issues than they used to be,” he said.\n“There’s a theatre for the expression of extremely strong minded, sometimes racist, very often offensive comments on Twitter, on X, and on other social networks,” added Martigny.\n“You have a lot of X accounts who are really, really, really pro far-right. And so they played a role in discussing these issues and making it a controversy. And then this controversy is exported to the traditional media.”\nAs Nakamura was targeted by fringe and extreme far-right groups as well as far-right politicians, in an interview with BMFTV and RMC, Macron said that “the reactions shocked me … there were truly racist reactions.”\nHowever, Martigny says he sees Macron’s condemnation of the attacks as racist as an attempt to balance the scales after the passing of what the professor called a “very restrictive law on immigration” a few months ago.\nIn December, Macron passed a controversial bill calling for tougher immigration that was endorsed by the far-right, and rejected by many in his own camp.\nPoliticians such as Le Pen hailed the legislation as an “ideological victory” whilst French health Minister, Aurelien Rousseau resigned in protest. It included many amendments tightening immigration laws, one of which dictated children born to foreign parents on French soil would no longer become automatic French citizens but would have to apply for citizenship.\n“He needs to make that forgotten in a certain way by showing that he has a sense of balance on these issues,” Martigny states.\nBy promoting Nakamura, Martigny believes that Macron’s ambitions may have been to “show a very optimistic face for France.”\n“[There are] very strong cultural wars in France revolving around pop stars, and the type of pop stars that you can mobilize or the type of artists that you can mobilize when you want to unite the country.”\nWith less than 100 days to go until the Olympics, many hope Paris 2024 will give France the opportunity to show unity.\nHowever, the heated reactions to Nakamura hints at a more pessimistic outlook.\n",

        "content": "He came, he saw, he jabbed and then his life outside of the ring appeared to unravel.\nRyan Garcia was seen as poster boy for boxing, training alongside the likes of Canelo Álvarez and Óscar Valdez. The boxer would also frequently reference the importance of his religious faith.\n“Thank you, the Lord Jesus Christ. The King of Kings, Lord of Lords, thank you,” Garcia said at a pre-fight media conference.\nThen in January 2024, Garcia and his wife Andrea Celina, who have two children, announced their divorce.\nGarcia has a big smile on his face. He does a little dance and shakes his shoulders in a relaxed manner.\nHis joyous, carefree attitude belies what’s at stake. Garcia is within seconds of beating undefeated WBC super lightweight champion Haney in a performance which has got the boxing world talking – and then some.\nAhead of the fight, Garcia missed the weight limit for the bout, which ended his chances of competing for a world title on April 20. To miss the weight limit for a world title fight isn’t unheard of, but it’s rare.\nNonetheless, the 25-year-old Garcia knocked down Haney three times in a majority decision victory last Saturday in front of a sold-out crowd at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York.\nIt’s a result which not only reestablishes Garcia atop the boxing food chain, but also caps off a surreal week in his life.\n“I don’t give a f**k what people say about me,” Garcia said after the fight. “I walked through the fire and still held it down and still beat f**king Devin Haney and still drink every day.”\n“Not necessarily proud of that, but I’m just saying it was a statement to show you, you guys can’t really f**k with me.”\nFrom Muhammad Ali and Mike Tyson to Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder, boxing has had plenty of maverick fighters.\nHowever, the behavior of Garcia, who had previously had the reputation of a clean-cut boxing talent with the world at his feet, was so erratic on social media in the weeks preceding Saturday’s bout that some people thought the 25-year-old shouldn’t have been allowed to fight Haney.\n“In the ring, I’m gonna beat your a**,” Garcia posted on Instagram ahead of the fight. “You thought I wasn’t gonna make it to the fight. I bet you hoped I would’ve got pulled out. I bet you hoped it was some kind of mental health issues.”\nMany speculated that Ryan was going through a mental health crisis, including boxing promoter Eddie Hearn.\n“It’s like the Truman Show, watching Ryan Garcia implode,” Hearn said in an interview with Boxing Social.\nGarcia hasn’t shied away from talking about his struggles with mental health. After a knockout win over Luke Campbell in 2021, he stepped away from the sport of boxing to deal with his psychological struggles.\n“I had no choice. It was so intense. Usually, I can get past things because I’m mentally strong,” Garcia told The Breakfast Club.\n“This one was different. It was like nope, you’re not getting up today. It was everything. I thought I was losing my mind.”\nGarcia returned to the sport in April 2022 to secure a unanimous decision win over Emmanuel Tagoe in San Antonio, Texas.\nFast forward to April 2024 and Garcia ramps up the braggadocio levels ahead of his fight with Haney, taking to Instagram to say he’s been cleared to fight after a mandatory drug test and mental health evaluation.\n“I proved to everybody that I don’t do drugs. I’m perfect,” Garcia said in a video. “I’m perfectly fine. I’ve been evaluated. I had a meeting with the state commission. I don’t understand why people continue to judge me so hard. I’m just having fun.”\nCNN asked the New York State Athletic Commission for details as to how it evaluated Garcia’s fitness to fight.\n“The commission works to protect the health and safety of all participants in combative sports, and to preserve the integrity of combative sport competition in New York State,” said the Commission in a statement.\n“The Commission has broad authority to assess the medical fitness of professional athletes (mental and physical health included), and engages in a thorough case-by-case diligence process with every professional athlete based on their personal medical history and circumstances prior to their participation in competition.\n“No match is held until the professional athletes are found medically fit for competition. The Commission will not comment on the specific medical testing and evaluations of any particular person.”\nCNN has also reached out to Garcia’s representatives to offer the boxer the opportunity to comment.\nHowever, at the weigh-in, Garcia takes to the stage and chugs what appeared to be a beer. He later told Youtuber and fighter Jake Paul in a recorded call that it was apple juice and sparkling water.\nThe weight for the fight had been set at 140 pounds, but, to the surprise of many, Garcia came in at just over 143 pounds.\nOne who wasn’t surprised was Haney, who throughout the pre-fight press conference, predicted Garcia would miss weight.\nDuring the press conference for the fight, Haney asked Garcia to pay him $500,000 per pound if he missed weight. Haney later said that Garcia honored the agreement by paying him the $1.5 million.\nAccording to sources who spoke to ESPN, Garcia forfeited upward of $600,000 of his purse to step into the ring with Haney.\nAs a result, Garcia’s shot at winning the WBC super lightweight was lost but he still fought Haney, despite coming into the bout as a huge underdog.\nIn the first round, Garcia pounced on Haney with constant pressure. Haney felt his power when he connected flush with a left hook. In the second, third and fourth rounds, Haney made adjustments and won by utilizing his jab.\nBut Garcia’s speed and power proved to be too much as the fight entered the later rounds. For the first time in Haney’s professional career, Garcia was able to knock him to the canvas in the seventh, 10th and 11th rounds.\nIn the end, Garcia’s hand was raised, winning by the judges’ scores of 115-109, 114-110 and 112-112.\nAlthough he missed a shot at claiming a championship belt, Garcia exited Saturday’s fight with his reputation greatly enhanced after handing Haney his first professional defeat.\nAnd if Garcia’s reputation as one of the most exciting boxing talents took a hit last year when he suffered his first professional defeat to Gervonta Davis, Saturday’s victory is a giant step in rebuilding his boxing pedigree.\n“Come on, guys, you really thought I was crazy? You all lost your own minds.” Garcia said in his post-fight interview. “You guys overegg everything.”\nGarcia and Haney fought six times in the amateurs, each winning three fights. After Saturday night’s fight, both boxers agreed to a rematch.\n",

He will have the chance to break the record when the French Open starts on May 20.\n“You take nothing but the win, that’s the mentality. You kind of visualise yourself achieving that already. So I’ve been, you know, really looking forward to it,” Djokovic said.\n“Of course I’m not the only one that wants to grab that title but I look forward to it. I like competing with different generations. You have the young guys who are coming up … they’re all incredibly hungry and fit and fast.\n“But I use my adaptability to adjust my tactics and my game to them and understand really what it takes, you know, what it takes to stay at the top and compete with these guys and try to win more titles.”\nSportswoman of the Year: Aitana BonmatíSportsman of the Year: Novak DjokovicBreakthrough of the Year: Jude BellinghamSportsperson with Disability: Diede de GrootTeam of the Year: Spain women’s national teamComeback of the Year: Simone Biles\nDjokovic was awarded his Laureus award by NFL great Tom Brady after a remarkable 2023 season where he won three out of the four grand slams.\nThe pair have grown close over the years and Brady praised his friend for not only being an “amazing player and talent” but “a great man, too.”\n“[He] has great integrity,” Brady told CNN, standing alongside Djokovic.\n“I think what you’ve seen over all these years, the competition always, in my view, brings out the best in people and it certainly has brought out the best in him.”\nDespite turning 37 later this year, Djokovic said he has no plans of slowing down and is not close to contemplating retirement.\nThe focus, he said, is very much on the next tournament, rather than looking back on his achievements.\n“I feel like it’s so important to always remind yourself to be in the present moment, really to appreciate, to acknowledge, to remember where you came from, the journey, the path, also the people that surround you,” Djokovic said.\n“Every single week there’s something new happening and new events. So I think I will truly be able to appreciate everything that we have accomplished really, only post-career, to be honest.\n“Because while you’re still active … it’s what’s the next task?

You’ll always love the sport, but I think there’s also different ways you can contribute as you go through life.”\nSpeaking about how elite athletes manage to adapt to retirement, Brady added: “We rarely look back. We always want to look forward because we’re ambitious people.\n“I think to be in this situation that we’ve been fortunate to be in, it takes a lot of ambition and it’s not like a switch you just turn off.\n“So you just keep going as long as you can, and you try to make the best of every opportunity you get.”\n",

        "content": "Mong Shuan was just 16 when she turned to an unconventional source of income: selling betel nuts from a little stall in northern Taiwan. The stimulant, a small, oblong fruit derived from areca palms, is chewed by millions of people across Asia. For the next three years, Mong would work six days a week for the equivalent of around $670 a month. A small bonus was tacked on for dressing provocatively to entice male customers.\nHer job was to slice the nuts open and add a pinch of slaked lime (or calcium hydroxide, which increases the body’s absorption of the stimulant they contain), before neatly wrapping each one in a leaf. To meet her sales targets, the betel nut “must be delicious.” she told CNN in an email. But hoping to attract more business, Mong would wear her dyed red hair long, a little makeup and a schoolgirl outfit in the style of Japanese anime character Sailor Moon. “The most important thing is your appearance,” she added.\nVendors like Mong, who left the job in February, are known locally as “betel nut beauties.” The phenomenon emerged in the late 1960s, when the Shuangdong Betel Nut Stand, a stall in rural central Taiwan, successfully marketed their products with a campaign centered on its “Shuangdong Girls.” By the turn of the 21st century, tens of thousands of the neon-lit booths, which dot roadsides and industrial neighborhoods across the island, were staffed by young women.\nHoping to document the phenomenon, photographer Constanze Han spent a month in 2022 driving down the highway connecting the island’s capital, Taipei, to the southern city of Kaohsiung, meeting betel nut beauties along the way. Her fascination with the women dates back to the summer trips she used to make to her grandfather’s courtyard house on the outskirts of Taipei.\n“I loved driving there because there were the betel nut girls,” she recalled in a phone interview. “As a child, I didn’t really understand (who they were). My family had been to Amsterdam one time and we’d walked past the red-light district, so I thought it was a similar thing.”\nRelated article\nHow Taiwan’s new $220 million arts center radically rethinks theater design\nWhile the scenes of women, scantily clad in glass booths, might resemble brothels, selling betel nuts is not widely linked to prostitution in Taiwan. In fact, the women rarely leave their stalls except to approach drivers in their high heels. Nonetheless, the very existence of provocative betel nut beauties seemed strange in “a quiet, conservative culture” like Taiwan’s, said Han, who hoped her project could help dispel some of the stereotypes the women faced.\n“(People with) engrained ideas of respectability, without really knowing or having interacted with these girls, might be like, ‘Oh those are girls from the wrong side of the tracks,’” she said. But in reality, Han added, “they all seemed quite level (headed) and responsible.”\nThe photographer, who grew up between Hong Kong and New York with stints in Latin America, has always been interested in the jobs women take to survive regardless of the stigma associated with them. She was inspired by the work of Susan Meiselas, whose 1970s photo series “Carnival Strippers,” captured women working hard and long hours performing stripteases at carnivals in New England.\n“I always end up gravitating towards women,” said Han, who would spend time getting to know her subjects before asking to take their photos. “The conversation part, where there are no photographs, is such a big part of it. I end up having more honest conversations with women and I feel more curious about the nuances of their experiences.”\nHan photographed 12 women, mostly in their late teens or early 20s, apart from one slightly older subject named Xiao Hong, who dresses more conservatively as she prepares the product wearing bright blue gloves at a betel nut stall in New Taipei City. The others appear drenched in the neon light of their booths or are shot gazing out of the windows; one woman’s face is distorted by the reflection of the busy streets outside. The photographer would spend hours capturing small, quiet moments that reveal the job’s mundane nature.\nHan’s experience as a former fashion editor comes through in the photos, which often look as if they were staged or taken from the pages of a glossy magazine. But it’s important that her images are “as honest as possible,” she said.\nThe women would usually arrive for work in their normal clothes and get changed into more revealing garments in the booths, Han explained. Sometimes, owners would incentivize them to dress in a sexier way, though some of Han’s subjects said they would have done so anyway, because it helps them sell more products.\nOne of the women Han photographed, Ju Ju, is pictured wearing red lingerie as she looks out of her strobe-lit booth in the city of Taoyuan. She began selling betel nuts to help make ends meet, the photographer said, adding that employment opportunities were limited for the young mom, who has no higher education. But Ju Ju has since grown to value the stability of the job. She has now been promoted to a manager position of two booths, and hopes to buy her own stall one day, Han added.\nRelated article\nSecretive power plant in Taiwan opens to  public for the first time — as an art space\nNonetheless, concerns that the women are victims of exploitation persist in Taiwan, and have prompted some regulation over the past two decades. In 2002, for example, the local government in Taoyuan county implemented a strict dress code that requires sellers to cover their breasts, butts and bellies.\nAlthough it is traditionally served by Taiwan’s indigenous communities at important gatherings, use of the addictive stimulant is also declining sharply. The island’s Ministry of Health and Welfare — which notes that users are 28 times more likely to develop oral cancer than non-users — says that fewer than one in 16 Taiwanese men chewed betel nuts in 2018, down more than 43% from 2012.\nAs such, Han’s photos document an aspect of Taiwanese life that may eventually cease to exist. She hopes viewers “can look at it as an interesting phenomenon without too much judgement.”\n“I hope that (the photo series) opens people up to a different idea of — or a curiosity about — Taiwan as a whole.”\n",

        "content": "There’s a new kind of “get ready with me” video trending in mainland China ­— one of “gross” work outfits.\nChina’s youth are donning their worst pajama bottoms, hairiest slippers and heading to the office in a tongue-in-cheek rebellion against everything from bad bosses and poor work conditions to low pay and long hours. And they’re gleefully showing off their creations online.\nFor months, Chinese social media users have posted under hashtags like #grossoutfitforwork #uglyclothesshouldbeforwork #ootd (outfit of the day) and are asking others to share their own takes, unleashing a competition of who wore it worst.\nThe hashtag “grossoutfitforwork” has attracted more than 140 million views and tens of thousands of discussions on Chinese social media platform Weibo alone. In late February, a post by Douyin (China’s version of TikTok) user Kendou S, claiming she was chastised by her boss about her “gross” outfits which said she wore to battle the cold weather, went viral.\nIn a follow-up video, liked 752,000 times and reposted over 1.4 million times, Kendou S shows off one of her offending outfits — revealing layer after layer of mismatched pieces — a fluffy white hat, gray balaclava, tatty red gloves, puffer coat, pink quilted jacket, fleece sweater dress, plaid pajama bottoms, fur-lined slippers and knee-high socks.\nIn response to similar posts, one woman who posted a picture of herself in a neon yellow vest and baggy knee-length shorts wrote: “My coworker says I dress like a wild man,” while another commenter showing off a dirty yellow and blue jacket said: “My boss gave me 50 yuan (about 7 dollars) to wash my clothes and I was forbidden to shake hands with clients ever again.”\n“Earning such little salary, with ugly coworkers, what else do you expect from my outfit?” read yet another post.\nAfter embracing “tang ping” or “lying flat,” a philosophy that rejects the rat race and consumerism in favor of a less stressful life, young Chinese people have thrown “resignation parties” and are even paid to become “full-time children.” “Gross outfits” appear to be the latest attempt by some disenchanted Gen Z to make a statement as the country sees gloomy economic prospects and record high youth unemployment rates.\nA post shared by CNN (@cnn)\nYoung people in China are graduating into a tough job market, with the government reporting in January that the jobless rate in December 2023 stood at 14.9% among 16- to 24-year-olds. This figure, which was published after a five-month hiatus, excluded 62 million full-time students. The figure had previously hit a high of 21.3% in June.\n“They’re kind of like, why bother when your work and future life prospect is not looking that bright,” said Bohan Qiu, the 29-year-old founder of the Boh Project, a Shanghai and Seoul based creative, public relations and brand consultancy for fashion brands and more. “Before they saw (working) as chasing a dream…and (companies) motivated everyone to fight for the (economic) pie. Now people are like: ‘No that doesn’t exist, or it could be a lie,’” said Qiu.\nWhile the examples that have gone viral on social media are more extreme, Qiu said he believes casual dressing for work has always been popular in China and will continue. This, he said, will especially be the case at workplaces where overtime and long hours in front of a computer are the norm, and also with a younger generation who became accustomed to working remotely during the pandemic.\nQiu added that while his staff don’t dress the way the people in the viral videos do, they do tend to dress down. Workers have been known to come in wearing sweatpants, shorts, slippers and the like, he said, and it’s been accepted “as long as they looked cool.”\nEven those posting their ugly outfits on social media don’t have a problem with looking good — outside the workplace. Many have posted that they just prefer the “banwei” or “stench of work” not be on their favorite clothes.\nAnd while China’s state-run media were quick to criticize the trend of “lying flat” or “letting it rot,” People’s Daily called the phenomenon of dressing ugly at work a kind of “self-deprecation” and said as long as employees “dress appropriately, have a correct work attitude, do not affect other people, and do not involve issues of principle,” there’s no problem.\nQiu who works in the fashion industry also finds himself dressing down after moving to Shanghai. He said many of the smart suits he wore in Hong Kong are now languishing deep in his closet.\nAnd as temperatures rise, some have started to share their gross outfits for the spring.\nOne Douyin user posted a picture of a particularly egregious combo: grubby mustard toe socks and broken black sandals with gaudy plastic baubles.\n",

First carved large onto small “Venus” figurines some 25,000 years ago as totems of fertility, they’re now seen (or hidden) as a potent symbol of desire, motherhood, feminism, sexism, beauty ideals, defiance, controversy or illness, depending on context.\nAnd these are all themes explored broadly in the exhibition “Breasts,” a robust survey on display at the 60th Venice Bienniale. Hosted at the Palazzo Franchetti, the show includes artworks by household names such as Cindy Sherman, Robert Mapplethorpe and Salvador Dalí, as well as early-career artists including Anna Weyant, Chloe Wise and Lakin Ogunbanwo. Divided into five rooms against the building’s art deco designs, the artworks are meant to be in conversation with one another — and with exhibition-goers — according to the show’s curator Carolina Pasti.\n“It’s very intimate, so it’s perfect for international artists to develop a dialogue with each other,” she said in a video call.\nRelated article\nWhat to see at the 2024 Venice Biennale\nOne of the first juxtapositions visitors encounter is between the exhibition’s earliest work, an early 16th-century Madonna and child by Bernardino del Signoraccio, and a self-portrait by Sherman which depicts the artist draped in prosthetic breasts and a pregnant belly. Both images of motherhood feature exaggerated anatomy — the baby Jesus in Del Signoraccio’s panel painting exposing his mother’s rigid bosom, while Sherman displays a hyperreal silicone torso in her riff on the Raphael painting “La Fornarina” — and sets the stage by showing how Renaissance artists have continued to influence our attitudes around breasts today.\nFrom there, the show winds through painting, sculpture and design, photography, commercial advertising and video art, exploring the ways that breasts have been seen and represented through both the male and female gazes.\n“It goes back to cave paintings — we’ve always been fascinated with the human form, and particularly the female form, which has this incredible allure and mystery,” said the artist Teniqua Crawford, who is exhibiting a delicate rendering of the breast as landscape. “Artists keep going back to it.”\n“It’s been a wonderful moment to contemplate my own relationship with the meaning of  breasts,” she added of the show.\n“Breasts” was staged, in part, to promote breast cancer awareness, and marks a partnership with the medical research non-profit Fondazione IEO-MONZINO, which will receive a portion of its catalog sales. It’s a theme apparent throughout the show, with a vivid pink staging and backdrops inspired by the color of the cause. That includes a passageway designed by Buchanan Studio, “Booby Trap” which is draped in pink fabric and features 35 anatomical lights from above.\nAnd the opening night treats? All according to the theme, of course, with suggestively shaped chocolate bon bons and burrata.\nScroll to see artworks from the show, which will run through November 24 at the Palazzo Franchetti.\n",

        "content": "A rental property secretly transformed by the eccentric artist who lived there for three decades has been officially protected by the British government, five years after his death.\nShortly after Ron Gittins died in September 2019 at age 79, his family visited the apartment where he had lived since the mid-1980s in Birkenhead, just outside of Liverpool in northwest England.\nWhat they found inside left them totally awestruck. Gittins had decorated almost every available surface in his home and painted numerous murals depicting historical scenes. Among the artworks were paintings set in Ancient Egypt and Georgian England, as well as fireplaces in the shape of a roaring lion’s head and a giant minotaur head, and there was even a Roman bread oven.\nThe discovery was particularly surprising as Gittins, who had limited formal artistic training, largely discouraged people from visiting his home, an apartment on the first floor of a Victorian duplex comprising three main rooms, a hallway, kitchen and bathroom.\nAfter his death it became clear why, according to his niece, Jan Williams.\n“The house was an absolute tip and you couldn’t even get through the door,” she told CNN in a telephone interview.\nWilliams said her uncle was “flamboyant” and “really outlandish” and was often seen around the town in costume, foraging for things that he would load into a shopping cart—such as bags of cement.\n“This is one of the reasons the family didn’t see that much of him,” said Williams, adding that she last saw him in the year before his death.\n“His behavior was quite challenging but we still loved him and thought the world of him.”\nEvery room of the apartment was piled high with bags, boxes, books, art materials, food packaging and much more, as well as many hand-written notes, some of them in code.\nSoon afterward, Williams and her partner Chris Teasdale, who are themselves both artists and run a mobile exhibition space, started a campaign to save “Ron’s Place,” supported by friends, relatives, artists and others working within the world of culture and heritage.\nTogether they established the Wirral Arts and Culture Community Land Trust (WACCLT), which launched a crowdfunding campaign through the website Ron’s Place, applied for listed status and eventually bought the building last year.\nNow, the property has been granted “Grade II” listing by Britain’s Department for Culture, Media and Sport on the advice of national heritage body Historic England.\nA spokesperson for Historic England explained the significance of the listing in an email to CNN, saying: “Including Ron’s Place on the National Heritage List for England allows us to highlight and celebrate what is significant about this extraordinary place, and helps us to make sure that any future changes to it do not result in the loss of its significance.”\n“Ron would be absolutely over the moon,” Williams said of her late uncle.\n“He was a kind of performance artist and the flat he created was like his stage set and own private world.\n“He did have some mental health issues and went through spells of being really unstable. I think it was his artwork and creativity that kept him going.”\nThe property is currently undergoing work to “stabilize and preserve” the artwork for a “micro-museum,” while the trust is also hoping to convert the other apartments in the building to create a “holistic house of art and creativity,” according to Williams.\nThe space will then be available for other artists to work in, while further plans could also include developing the garden and cellar.\n“It’s quite poignant because when I was sorting through his stuff after he died I found this postcard to me saying ‘I would really love to show you what I’ve been making’ but the address was wrong and I never received it. It’s almost like I’m making up for it now,” she said.\nRon’s Place is the first example of Outsider Art to be given protected status in England, according to Historic England.\nAn internationally recognized creative phenomenon, Outsider Art is described by Tate as “art that has a naïve quality, often produced by people who have not trained as artists or worked within the conventional structures of art production.” It is created without an audience in mind, usually by and for the artist themselves.\nIn a press release, Historic England said: “The listing recognises Ron’s creation as an exemplar of large-scale Outsider Art in England, a creative phenomenon by artists motivated by their personal visions and often working in a compulsive way, usually with no formal training and outside the influence of the mainstream art world.”\nAmong the many fans of Gittins’ works is Jarvis Cocker, front man of the indie band Pulp and a patron of the campaign to preserve the property.\nReacting to the news in a statement released by Historic England, Cocker, who is also a patron of Ron’s Place, said: “A small number of people on this planet have known for a while that Ron’s Place is a very Special Place—but from now on it is official: Ron’s Place has been given listed status!\n“The work of one unique gentleman in the north of England has been recognised nationally. Globally even. Hallelujah!!”\nWilliams is proud of her uncle’s achievements and hopeful about the impact he will have on future generations.\n“He encouraged me to see being creative and unconventional as completely normal and I’m grateful for that,” she said. “He never really held down a job and rarely had a reliable income for long but he did have a wealth of imagination and creativity. We want to share that with other people and say be creative and be resourceful and see the potential in others around and what you could make out of it.”\n",

        "content": "(CNN) — At the premiere of his new film “Poolman” in Los Angeles on Wednesday night, Chris Pine stepped onto the red carpet in an artfully-disheveled ensemble. (Or perhaps just disheveled, for less charitable fashion critic.)\nOver a light beige slogan tee, Pine wore a “Miami Vice”-worthy blazer accessorized with a large pink peony boutonnière. He paired this with corduroy work shorts, a pair of well-worn hiking boots (with bright red laces that complemented the stripe detailing on his sports socks) and a pair of chunky mirrored sunglasses. His beard had grown in long and silver, his hair longer still with tousled ends creating an ombre effect.\nRelated article\nLook of the Week: Chris Pine ushers in sweater weather with a chaotic workout look\nThough his years in Hollywood have provided ample evidence that Pine can shine in the scrubbed-up suiting traditionally expected of leading men on press tours, front rows and at A-List events, he’s often been known to playfully incorporate louche tailoring and bohemian accessories into his outfits.\nAnd there have been multiple occasions, when snapped ‘off the clock,’ in which his aesthetic has skewed further into an eccentric, counter-cultural space; very much a ‘last clean clothes in the closet’ vibe from someone who can surely afford dry cleaning.\nBut isn’t there a subversive joy in a day spent in comfy sweatpants, let alone a day running errands — and under the paparazzi’s glare — in said sweatpants? Pine would seem to think so.\nOn the “Poolman” red carpet, the 43-year-old actor told E! of his look, and his outlook on fashion more broadly, that he has reached “a certain wonderful point in your life… where you don’t give as much of a FU anymore.” He cited “an 80s thing” as a style reference, and sartorial stars of that era like Tom Selleck and Harrison Ford.\nPine also noted that his effortless, eclectic personal style had also been inspired by his “Poolman” character — a Los Angeles swimming pool cleaner, as the film’s title suggests. So could this be another moment for “method dressing,” snuck under the style pack’s noses for months? If so, it marks Pine as one of the most fervent followers of the practice, dedicated to a fault — and then some.\n",

        "content": "Editor’s Note: Clarissa Wei is a Taiwanese American journalist and author living in Taipei. Her cookbook, “Made in Taiwan: Recipes and Stories From The Island Nation,” was published in 2023. The views expressed in this commentary are her own.\nWhen my parents were growing up in the 1970s, they did not consider Taiwan an idyllic place to start a family. It was under martial law and the steady drumbeat of threats from China only seemed to be getting louder with each passing year. My dad still remembers the anxiety that engulfed the island when the United States cut off diplomatic recognition of Taiwan in favor of the People’s Republic of China in 1979. “We weren’t sure if America would protect us if there was conflict,” he told me.\nAnd so, in their late 20s, they left everything they knew and moved to the suburbs of Los Angeles where I was born. They weren’t the only ones; roughly 20% of Taiwanese college graduates went abroad for advanced study in the 1970s and 1980s. Few returned.\nThis article is part of a CNN Opinion series where each month leading up to the US election, a writer in a different country explores how locals view America and why the choice of the next president matters to them.\nMy parents considered America a safe haven and wanted me to grow up with all its comforts. Whereas they grew up in cramped moldy buildings, I spent my childhood in a four-bedroom house with a backyard and a swimming pool.\nWhereas they walked to school on uneven sidewalks in a cloud of pollution, my mother drove me to school every day in a comfy SUV. My parents were raised under the shadow of martial law, where folks were jailed and killed for speaking their mind. I was raised in the land of the free, where freedom of speech is enshrined in the constitution as a human right.\nAnd yet, decades later, I ended up doing the exact opposite of what my parents did. In 2020 at the cusp of the global pandemic, I moved to Taiwan with my husband. Last year, I gave birth to a baby boy in Taipei.\nThreats from China have not abated. In fact, tensions have reached such historic highs that Taiwan is often dubbed “the world’s most dangerous place” by international analysts. This perception is so pervasive that every time my husband and I leave Taiwan, we are greeted with wide-eyed concern by friends and family. Are we safe in Taiwan? Do we think China will attack?\nThough my perspective may be myopic (given the very real possibility of conflict and a military blockade) and comes from a place of privilege (I am a dual citizen of both Taiwan and the United States), there’s currently nowhere else I’d rather be.\nA lot has changed over the past 30 years as Taiwan has transitioned from a dictatorship to a vibrant democracy.\nIn Taiwan, power is handed over peacefully while it’s no longer a certainty in the US.\nIn Taiwan, guns are illegal. In America, guns are a leading cause of death to children.\nTaiwan has universal health care; I can pop into any clinic or hospital for immediate and affordable treatment. My entire medical record can be accessed instantaneously via a chip on my health card. In America, medical insurance is opaque and not guaranteed.\nThe contrasts are especially stark now that I am a new mother. The Taiwanese subway system has designated seating areas for pregnant women and children, and there are breastfeeding rooms at every major station.\nThe city has free play centers for children stocked with a wide range of toys. All new parents in Taipei are eligible for monthly cash handouts, and certified daycares and at-home nannies services are subsidized by the city government. In the States, only low-income families qualify for financial aid.\nOf course, comparing the United States and Taiwan this way without acknowledging the nuanced socio-political contexts can be misleading. While the American health care system is notoriously difficult to navigate, it is far more advanced and state-of-the-art than Taiwan’s.\nWhile Taiwan is great for babies, it can be stressful for school-aged children; the education system emphasizes rote memorization and stifles creative freedom. My husband and I are not convinced we want to stay in Taiwan forever, but America, with its shocking lack of family-friendly policies, is on the bottom of the list of places we’d consider moving to.\nMany Taiwanese people still hold the United States in high regard, but more as a military ally and defender of the island. During the 2020 American presidential election, many in Taiwan rooted for Donald Trump specifically because of his aggressive anti-China rhetoric.\nDuring this year’s election cycle, however, opinions are much more muted. President Joe Biden has defied skeptics by maintaining a tough stance against China over the last four years and pro-Trump sentiments have waned considerably, especially in light of recent comments by the former president accusing Taiwan of taking away America’s semiconductor business.\n“As long as the United States continues to show both symbolic and substantive support and collaboration with Taiwan, I don’t think Taiwanese people actually care who the next US president is,“ Wei-Ting Yen, an assistant professor at Franklin & Marshall College in the US who specializes in Asian countries, told me over a video call.\nMy friends in the States are convinced I’m living in a highly volatile and dangerous place. But Taiwanese people harbor similar beliefs about the States.\nClarissa Wei\nThe biggest shift, then, has been how the people of Taiwan perceive the United States. While it remains a popular immigration destination for those who can afford it, America has lost its luster as a sanctuary. My friends in the States are convinced I’m living in a highly volatile and dangerous place. But Taiwanese people harbor similar beliefs about the States.\nRecently at a Chinese medicine shop in Taipei, the owner asked if I felt safe walking down the streets of Los Angeles. He was under the impression that all the major American cities had become wildly unsafe in the last couple of years, rampant with crime and shootings. “Aren’t there guns everywhere?” he asked sincerely. “It sounds so messy.”\n“I’m definitely more comfortable here,” I responded, not wanting to get into the specifics.\nHe nodded deeply. “Taiwan is safer,” he said.\nIt’s not so much that the United States has become more dangerous (that is the perception, but statistics show otherwise); it’s more that I have gotten used to letting my guard down. In Taipei, I can walk down dark alleyways long past midnight with my purse wide open without fear of getting robbed. I can leave my phone, wallet and laptop on a coffee shop table, go to the bathroom, and be certain that my possessions will all be there when I come back. Some of my friends don’t even lock their front doors. I would not feel comfortable doing any of the above in America.\nAccording to last year’s Global Peace Index, Taiwan is the 33rd most peaceful state or territory in the world. The United States, on the flip side, is the 131st.\nLast year when my husband and I were in the San Francisco Bay Area for a wedding, our friends instructed us not to not leave anything valuable in the car. Coming from Taiwan, we didn’t think much of the advice, until we were looking for parking one day and noticed all the broken car window glass on the streets.\nLately, my parents and many of their friends living in the US have been planning their retirement to Taiwan. Emboldened with dual citizenship and the option of being able to leave the island in the worst-case scenario, they are no longer affected by the anxiety of their youth.\nNow in his 60s, my father is convinced the Chinese threat will not materialize. While I don’t agree with him, I understand his point of view. Cross-strait tensions have been strained for seven decades already and, with each passing year, the conflict feels more abstract in spite of the heightened rhetoric and airspace incursions because, eventually, you become numb to it.\nChina’s Communist Party considers Taiwan a part of its territory - despite never having controlled it. They have not ruled out force to annex Taiwan.\nThe possibility of war hangs over like a persistent dark cloud. If you think about it long enough, it makes you nervous and clammy. But because it’s a plausibility, not an immediate reality, it’s easy to ignore. If anything, political violence and upheaval in the States seems far more likely, especially since it would not be unprecedented. On a day-to-day basis, at least, Taiwan seems like the more sensible place to live.\nI asked my dad — a lifelong Republican — who he believed was a bigger threat this year: Chinese president Xi Jinping or former president Donald Trump.\nHe responded without hesitation. “Trump,” he said. “Because he’s more unpredictable.”\n",

        "content": "Editor’s Note: Allison Hope’s writing has been featured in The New Yorker, The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, Slate and elsewhere. The views expressed here are her own. Read more opinion on CNN.\nLesbian Visibility Week, celebrated each year at the end of April, was first observed in California in 1990 and is marked around the world and in lesbian living rooms across America — including mine.\nHaving been rendered largely invisible in the past, lesbians today have reason to celebrate our visibility. But in the past, being “out of view” of straight society was both a blessing and a curse.\nOne of the most infamously quoted lines cited in the Bible to condemn LGBTQ people is found in the book of Leviticus 18:22 — Old Testament scripture embraced by some who insist it should govern how “good Christians”  live.\nThe New King James Version of the verse proclaims, “You shall not lie with a male as with a woman. It is an abomination.”\nIt says nothing about women not sleeping with women. I’d like to think that God liked lesbians. However, the truth is most likely that lesbian invisibility has been compounded by the long history of misogyny and the absence of women from the seat of power. We were twice rendered irrelevant.\nNot that invisibility only has downsides. Many laws have criminalized gay men but not women, leaving us in slightly safer territory. Lesbians also have been largely exempted from some of the worst forms of discrimination, at least the kinds enshrined in law.\nSingapore’s draconian ban on gay sex, for example, which was repealed in 2022, only prohibited sex between men, with no mention of women. Gay men are also more likely to be victims of hate crimes and violence. Being invisible means we’re less likely to get caught in the crosshairs of hateful legislation aimed only at us.\nRelated article\nOpinion: There’s no compassion, humanity or Christianity in this statement from the Archdiocese of New York\nNone of that means, however, that we’ve fully escaped society’s homophobic vitriol and violence. Lesbians have long been subjected to the same shades of hate, stereotyping and subjugation that other LGBTQ people have long endured.\nWe’ve been depicted as murderers or the murdered in movies and books, the butt of jokes or stock characters, expendable characters or invisible ones. We’ve quietly endured straight marriages we thought we had to pursue and lost true loves to heteronormative rules gay people thought they needed to play by. We’ve long been forced into the role of childless aunt in our communities, or described euphemistically as the one who lives with her long-term “friend.” We’ve been expected to avoid injuring fragile male egos but still be able to open jars or fix leaky faucets.\nIn the worst cases, we’ve been victims and survivors of “corrective” rape, murder, abuse, harassment and banishment by our families and communities. Gay men might be criminalized, but gay women have long been targeted, sometimes in heinous ways that fly under the radar of the law, and which go unprosecuted.\nStill, lesbians have quietly been forming families and operating under the radar for a long time. It’s easier, after all, to read two lesbians with a child as aunts or sisters than two men with a child. We have side-stepped some of society’s worst condemnations.\nAs activists, lesbians were key advocates during the AIDS crisis, both in caring for our dying gay male chosen family members and demanding federal support for treatment options. Lesbians were also critical but sometimes unacknowledged players in advancing the Second Wave Feminist movement and advocating on the national stage. Yet, when it came time to support equal rights for lesbians, or even to raise the needs of lesbians in HIV/AIDS advocacy, both groups that we had helped for the most part failed to step up for us.\nIn spite of the challenges we’ve faced, or perhaps because of them, we celebrate our fabulous, lesbian selves. Some studies have shown that we have more satisfying sex than do our straight, cisgender peers and we earn nine percent more on average, possibly because of the reduced need for childcare duties and the higher-wage occupations pursued by lesbians.\nRelated article\nHow to love yourself this Galentine’s Day\nWe inhabit, in my view, the best parts of femininity and masculinity. We are vocal allies for our gay brothers, and our trans family and friends (minus the TERFS, dubbed feminists who don’t support trans people). I can both throw a football with my child and cuddle them to my bosom with pure maternal zeal. I can make love to a woman and watch silly rom coms with her, too. My wife is both my soulmate and my best friend. It feels like a tremendous gift I’ve been bestowed to be a lesbian.\nOver the years, lesbians have gained visibility and mainstream media has introduced more nuanced and accurate depictions of who we are and the diversity within the lesbian community. TV shows like “The L-Word” broke barriers. Its runaway success came on the heels of more niche media that paved the path, such as “Dyke TV” in the 1990s — a public access news channel that aired weekly in dozens of markets across the US.\nToday, there are more than a handful of movies and shows that feature recurring lesbian characters that are multi-dimensional and where being a lesbian is an aspect of their persona, rather than a plot device. Lesbians have welcomed A-listers out of the closet, including Jodie Foster, Lily Tomlin and Kate McKinnon, and have elevated formerly “niche” lesbian performers into mainstream roles, like Lea DeLaria and Wanda Sykes.\nThere is also an interesting trend of lesbian bars, which have long been critical gathering spaces for lesbians. For a while many were on the verge of extinction but now they’re making a comeback as new watering holes owned by and catering to lesbians spring up around the US. We’re getting married, having kids and assimilating into the historically hostile — but now more welcoming — cishet (heterosexual and not transgender) suburbs.\nGuilty as charged.\nMany of us are also expressing our sexuality and gender in more expansive ways. When I came out a generation ago, you were either cisgender (identifying with the gender assigned at birth), gay or a lesbian. Now, many are identifying as transgender, nonbinary, pansexual or a proliferation of other gender and sexual identities.\n\nWe think about lesbians as connected to gender, but so many, me included, feel more fluid. I don’t fit into the gender binary, but “lesbian” has also been the word that most closely describes me. Lesbian is not just a personal identity; it’s a political one. In that sense, I am very much a lesbian. A proud lesbian. A big dyke, to be more exact.\nVisibility matters. Seeing yourself reflected in leaders and stars and role models provides a level of psychological safety that is critical to feeling like a person who can walk through the world with their head held high, like our lives matter.\nOn this Lesbian Visibility Week, I am grateful both to be seen and to slip quietly under the radar, unnoticed. Nothing to see here, culture warriors. Just a slightly butch, pragmatic lesbian over here, completing mundane tasks and retiring to the couch with my wife to watch something sensible on TV.\n",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more CNN Opinion.\nIt’s hard to truly comprehend how difficult and relentless a problem climate change is for a country as large as India. One way would be to rig a drone with a very large battery pack and fly it from one end to the other.\nStart in the south in Bangalore, India’s Silicon Valley, in the fall of 2022. Fly very, very slowly northwards until you reach the Himalayas just before the national elections that started this week.\nYou would witness a country in constant convulsion.\nSoon after take off, you’d see the swish houses and gleaming towers of Bangalore’s new tech and corporate elite submerged amid September 2022’s monsoon rains. Just a little further north and a few months on in March 2023, record breaking fires tear through Karnataka state’s forests, the smoke obscuring vision for days.\nThen, on to the heaving, humid metropolis of Mumbai at summer’s onset in April 2023 to find over a dozen people dead, mostly women, due to heat exposure at a large public gathering. Next, entire stretches of Delhi under water from flooding in July.\nThat same summer, hospitals in the sunburnt state of Uttar Pradesh, home to over 240 million people, fill with listless, heat-stroked workers. Finally, the anticipated visual reprieve of the Himalayan snow caps that never comes — instead replaced by an almost snowless winter that continues into 2024.\nThe impacts of India’s extreme weather are not neatly contained within the country’s borders. This is a global worry. When India introduces wheat export bans due to a heat wave or slows its vaunted IT exports because Bangalore is underwater, the lives of seemingly unconnected millions across the world are affected.\nIndia is the world’s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China and the US. It is also the world’s fastest-growing major economy.\nHow India handles climate change, then, is everyone’s concern. But while climate is mentioned in the election manifestos of the two main parties — the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress — it will, perhaps surprisingly, not feature as a major issue in India’s six-week-long national election that started this week. That’s unlike in Australia, the UK and US, among others, where elections can be significantly influenced by climate policy positions.\nThis is because climate politics looks different in the developing world; it will shape Indian elections in definitive but under-the-radar ways. Climate impacts do shape voter demands — though this tends to filter through as anxieties about livelihood and continued welfare support, rather than in a neatly defined area of politics labeled “climate.”\nYou can see it in farmers asking for loan waivers and irrigation facilities after years of drought, in urban families demanding reduced electricity prices to offset cooling bills and in calls for more penetrating social welfare.\nHere in the world’s most-populous country, the average Indian does not emit very much at present. India’s relatively low per-capita carbon emissions of 1.9 tons per person are less than half of the global average of 4.7 tons per person — and several times lower than developed economies.\nThis duality — low per-capita emissions and a rapidly growing economy — also shapes India’s climate policy. The incumbent government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has both pushed the rapid deployment of renewables and domestic green manufacturing to create jobs, while continuing to rely on fossil fuels to power the economy. That’s fairly similar to previous governments.\nLeaf through the BJP and Congress’ election manifestos and you will find several dozen pledges across sectors that could be filed under climate policy, with a roughly even split between the two parties (though their emphases predictably differ).\nStump speeches throughout this campaign season have not featured climate change as a central issue.\nAditya Valiathan Pillai\nBut these are listed across several chapters and rarely mention the word “climate” (though each has a separate chapter on sustainable development). Similarly, stump speeches throughout this campaign season have not featured climate change as a central issue.\nParties do however focus on climate-adjacent developmental issues — including expanding entitlements for the poorest (which could also help with weather shocks), creating jobs through green manufacturing and reconfiguring Indian agriculture.\nBut politics here seems to reflect the relative insignificance of climate change as a conceptual category in the Indian voter’s mind. When tens of thousands of farmers marched through Maharashtra in 2018 after several years of drought across parts of the state, they protested against rising agricultural debt, declining productivity, pests and inadequate irrigation. This was a climate protest in all but slogan.\nTake for example a Muslim woman I spoke with a few years ago from the poorer reaches of North Bengal. Her small house in an informal settlement in Delhi was engulfed in a summer fire, and then a few years later her family home in Bengal was damaged in a monsoon flood.\nShe supports a large family of children and grandchildren as a house cleaner in Delhi’s rich neighbourhoods. Despite the fingerprint of climate impacts on her past, her main demands in previous elections were for regular water (which she gets once in two weeks from a water truck), cheaper electricity (she told me she pays around three times the price her rich employers pay because of an illegal connection), and cheaper health care.\nRelated article\nNarendra Modi: India’s popular but controversial leader seeking a transformative third term\nElections turn, then, on meeting developmental exigency. The headwinds of climate change are absorbed by the electoral machine and emerge as end-of-tailpipe policies rather than grand climate strategy.\nThis pattern of climate politics is reinforced by seemingly low recognition in India of climate change as a problem. In a 2022 survey of over 4,500 individuals across the country, over 50% of respondents said they knew little or nothing about climate change. Interestingly, recognition of climate change increased to over 80% in that survey when respondents were supplied with a short description of the phenomenon.\nThe hotch-potch of ad hoc policy fixes that emerges around climate issues will only get the country so far. It fails when put to the long-term test. Mobilizing large amounts of public finance to redesign cities to trap less heat and flood less, for example, requires a genuine public debate about a climate-ravaged future. Immediate investments are necessary to dull the blow tomorrow.\nThe climate crisis also deepens the case for global cooperation. India’s climate-outages are going to be hard for trading partners and global markets to ignore as its economy grows. Domestic politics that focus on immediate developmental goals rather than long-term climate-proofing creates a gaping hole that global adaptation finance must fill.\n\nThis has a moral dimension, too. The climate impacts buffeting India today are largely because of the historical emissions of developed counterparts.\nGlobal resilience must be a priority in an interconnected world. The climate impacts buffeting the most populous nation on earth aren’t just a domestic issue — they’re an international one.\nTamanna Dalal, of the Sustainable Futures Collaborative, assisted the author with research.\n",

The views expressed here are solely hers. Read more opinion on CNN.\nFriday’s midnight release of “The Tortured Poets Department,” Taylor Swift’s 11th album, means that yet another era has begun — and a record-breaking one at that. Swifties, who are now more than familiar with football jargon (at least when it comes to Kansas City Chiefs’ tight end Travis Kelce, Taylor’s beau) can finally put away the grill and the drinks, lock the car, and leave the parking lot for the stadium. The tailgate is over: it’s game on for Taylor Nation.\nI am one of them, and the anticipation — along with the revelry — has been an extended family affair.\nHaving secured tickets to an epic night of the Eras tour last spring at Gillette Stadium, my daughter Hannah and I made a pilgrimage from New York to attend the show with my lifelong best friend Sarah and her daughter Maggie. We were two moms with decades of concerts — from Def Leppard to U2 to Lizzo — under our belts, and our teen daughters, with whom we have danced to the likes of Harry Styles, Olivia Rodrigo and SZA.\nThe thing is, after that night at Gillette, I thought we were on the other side of Swift mania for a while. I was wrong. When more dates were announced, Maggie somehow got a code and purchased four seats for us in … are you ready for it?\nVancouver. A mere 2,500 miles away.\nThe seats are terrible, Sarah told me. It would be ridiculous to do this, we reasoned. I was very close to getting Hannah to agree it was too much. But Maggie was not to be dissuaded — and Sarah and I realized this might be the last great thing we do before these girls of ours leave our houses and head to college, to jobs and to lives that will be even more of their own than they are now.\nWe are not alone in this. The broader Swiftie community serves as a connector for all kinds of relationships, from best friends to parents and kids, creating a landscape for communication, bonding and the rites of passage that can be so difficult, perhaps especially for teenage girls like our daughters.\nAn absurdly brief trip to Vancouver via — literally — planes, trains, and an automobile was set. All things Swiftie, then, were settled. Or so we thought, until February.\nRelated article\nOpinion: A concert mom’s take on Taylor Swift and Ticketmaster\nThat’s when Swift, at the Grammys no less (where she won a historic fourth Album of the Year award for “Midnights”), announced “The Tortured Poets Department” would be coming on April 19. In the days leading up to the big night, Swifties speculated that the artist would reveal the long-awaited re-release of “Reputation,” her sixth album, which many felt would be the next “Taylor’s Version,” a series of re-recordings that allowed her to regain rights to her material after Big Machine, her original record company, sold her masters.\nSwifties dug into Taylor math, which often revolves around the number 13, the date of her December birthday. Indeed, 13 days before the Grammys, her friends, including Kelce, had changed their profile pictures on social media to black and white, the colors of “Reputation.” She showed up on the Grammys’ red carpet in a white dress with black accents. Her website went down, replaced by a black screen and seemingly meaningless words in white, including “Error 321” and “DPT:321” and “hneriergrd,” which Swifties unscrambled as “red herring.”\nThe speculation was overwhelming: A fax error? A countdown? A blind alley? No. It was the new album. With a smile and what looked like a peace sign, she left the stage, the album’s cover immediately going up on her Instagram site.\nThe pregame anticipation on this one has been intense, starting with how and when she recorded this, her fourth album in four years, while prepping and executing the highest-grossing concert tour of all time. Her work ethic makes the rest of us mere mortals feel inadequate at best. She writes, like Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Alexander Hamilton, as if she is running out of time.\nBut the bigger question was what — who — this record was about, and all paths led to the 2023 end of her six-year relationship with British actor Joe Alwyn.\nRelated article\nTaylor Swift’s surprise double album ‘The Tortured Poets Department’ is daggers wrapped in a lullaby\nThe easiest clue, of course, is the title itself, a seemingly savage take on Alwyn’s WhatsApp chat with his friends entitled “The Tortured Man Club.” The release date, too, holds value. While fans locate Swift’s split from Alwyn to be anywhere from February to early April, 2023, it was on April 19 that she went to dinner with friends Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, who subsequently unfollowed Alwyn on social media. The date also, of course, marks the anniversary of the split of the 13 American colonies (13, don’t forget) from Great Britain in 1775 with the Battle of Lexington and Concord, starting a war against a perceived tyranny that would end in independence for the oppressed.\nAn album about liberation? Freedom? Separation? A break from … a British boyfriend? A date chosen because 256 days remain in the year, and if you add those numbers up you get 13?\nWhen the track list emerged, all eyes went to track five, which is where Swift has always located her heart, producing gut-wrenching tracks such as “Dear John” on “Speak Now,” “My Tears Ricochet” on “Folklore” and the epic “All Too Well” on “Red,” which allegedly details in excruciating detail her breakup with actor Jake Gyllenhaal.\nThis time around, we have “So Long, London,” cowritten with The National’s Aaron Dessner, whose last track five with Swift was on “Evermore,” the devastating “Tolerate It.”\nSo, what has my cohort of Swifties made of all this? My best friend’s daughter, the teen I thought might be done with all this for a while (as we wait for Vancouver), might actually be the Swiftie of all Swifties, a Taylor archivist of sorts (with a brother who was born on … December 13). Where does all of this fit, I asked her — what’s the long game?\nRelated article\nWhy young people are throwing PowerPoint parties\nIn true Gen Z fashion, she responded a few hours later with an extensive, masterful, complex slide deck presentation that would undoubtedly nab her an A in Harvard’s Taylor course. She contextualized the theories — some rational, some out there, but all relevant because in Swiftie world, nothing is coincidence and everything is intentional — and concluded that this was, indeed, Swift’s first “break-up” record since “Red” (see Gyllenhaal).\nSuddenly “You’re Losing Me,” a bonus track from “Midnights,” which is about the things that keep you up at night, seemed like a precursor, a song about the beginning of an end, especially when longtime collaborator Jack Antonoff referred to recording the song back in 2021. More clues came when a pale gray and pink “Pop-Up Library” exhibit sponsored by Spotify went up at The Grove in Los Angeles, seemingly a poetry library filled with Swift’s manuscripts.\nIt’s one thing to be a puzzle to your fans — it’s entirely another to make a puzzle for your fans. Swift has created music’s version of “I Spy” novels for this generation, encoding notes in her lyrics, creating everything from complex numerologies to word searches. The relentless hunt for Easter eggs across social media suddenly took physical form in this exhibit: from the 72 (the number of months Swift was with Alwyn) card catalogue drawers, six (the number of years Swift was with Alwyn) of which are open and filled with lace and dead flowers to a bust of the goddess Diana, the original statue crumbled on its way to London in the 6th century because of neglect. “Even statues crumble,” Swift’s TTPD billboard says in New York’s Times Square, “if they’re made to wait.”\nRelated article\nWhy everyone is crying to Taylor’s breakup songs\nWhen it was finally midnight, game time, all members of my own Swiftie family were in our own homes listening to the same thing, track by track, unpacking words and music, texting thoughts and questions (Who is Dylan Thomas? My name is in a song! My name is too!). I went to track five first, which everyone else found to be heresy. But it confirmed an awful lot of what everyone suspected: Swift’s voice at its most vulnerable with the words “And I’m pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free.”\nWas it about Alwyn? Yes. Was it about other things, including (especially?) Matty Healy? Also, yes. Is “The Alchemy” about Kelce? Oh my. Yeah. Maybe. Probably.\nAs we continued to listen — and yes, Friday’s a school/work day but who needs sleep??!! — alongside all of the Swifties posting emotional selfies and TikToks with their hands slapped over their mouths in awe, shouty caps pronouncing their love for this track or that, we found (we thought) answers to many questions, and had new questions that needed answers.\nThis record is as messy as it is emotional. It felt like the initial speculation all those months ago were somewhat vindicated. Perhaps what we thought were peace signs — from Swift’s gesture at the Grammys to a sculpture in The Grove exhibit — were actually twos.\nIn many ways, “Reputation” and “TTPD” felt like two sides of the same relationship, their inverted black and white color schemes creating a yin and a yang, and while the first contains her first love songs to Alwyn — from “Delicate” to “Gorgeous” — the latter creates needed closure, maturity even.\n\nAnd at 2am, with the drop of the rest of what is now an old-fashioned double album, the “two” symbolism took on yet another layer of meaning. Two albums, not one. 31 tracks. And yes, 31 is 13 backwards and that, too, is no accident. Check out the erratic capitalization of track 24, “Thank you Aimee” if you doubt that Swift is masterminding it all. For my merry band of Swifties, there are no accidents. Just puzzles to gleefully solve, together, for as long as we can.\n“Once we have spoken our saddest story, we can be free of it,” Swift wrote on X (formerly Twitter) just after midnight.  “And then all that’s left behind is the tortured poetry.”  For my group of four, what is left to ponder as we continue to digest this record, together, in the coming months is what might be our last concert road trip, our last stab at a mother-daughter journey. Maybe wherever they land, there is a seminar on Taylor Swift.  Then maybe we can study for the final exam together.\n",

        "content": "Editor’s Note: Noah Berlatsky (@nberlat) is a freelance writer in Chicago. The views expressed here are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\nWar films often try to overwhelm you with authenticity. Movies like “Saving Private Ryan,” (1998), “Dunkirk,” (2017) or this year’s “Civil War” saturate viewers with the realism of their combat sequences and the gritty power of simulated trauma. That’s why war movies are often treated as serious and important: They offer what seems to be unique, powerful access to a rare but important experience. Watch “Apocalypse Now” (1979), “Full Metal Jacket” (1987) or “Platoon” (1986) and you should know what war really means.\nGuy Ritchie’s “The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare” claims to be based on true events; it’s modeled on the 1942 World War II Operation Postmaster, in which a British team seized enemy ships in the Spanish harbor of Fernando Po. But even 10 minutes in, the connection to the real experience of war is tenuous.\nThe film is a rip-roaring, goofy adventure yarn. And while I wouldn’t necessarily say that makes this a better movie than “Apocalypse Now,” there is something refreshing, even honest, about Ritchie’s willingness to toss pretension overboard, and let a fictional film own its fictional inauthenticity.\n“Ungentlemanly Warfare” features a disreputable band of riff raff brought together for a super-secret mission. That mission is to sink a key German vessel which resupplies German U-boats. The ship is in neutral waters off Fernando Po, and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill (a frantically mugging Rory Kinnear) needs a team he can disavow. He turns to Gus March-Phillips (Henry Cavill in masses of insouciant facial hair) as a leader with subordinates including titanically cheerful Scandinavian murder machine Anders Lassen (Alan Ritchson) and the brave, elegantly sensuous, undercover operative Marjorie Stewart (Eiza González.)\nThe setting comes with ready-made villains in the Nazis and patriotic resonance, but the plot machinations barely matter; they’re merely an excuse to show our heroes making dry quips about cricket and their own indomitability as they shoot fascists in the head, carve out their hearts and set off extremely large explosions.\nThe protagonists are so dashing, hypercompetent and destined for victory that there isn’t even really any suspense. “The Guns of Navarone” (1961) — an obvious precursor — was at least willing to acknowledge that in war, sometimes good people die. Ritchie makes no such concessions to authenticity in “Ungentlemanly Warfare.”\nYou could argue that this kind of glib triumphalism ill prepares people for the realities of war, or for the reality of fascism. And, sure, you’d have a point. Our rag-tag band has no doubts as they swagger to victory; they literally giggle when Nazis threaten them and chat nonchalantly while being tortured by electroshock.\nDecency comes as easily as courage: Only the Nazis are prejudiced, while the good guys are untouched by the racism and sexism endemic in their era (as, for that matter, in ours). Churchill’s history of colonial atrocities is of course never mentioned. Fighting fascism in others, and fascist sympathies on one’s own side, looks easy. Which, as we know from our current threats to democracy, is not the case.\nYet the movie is so unremittingly silly that it’s hard to imagine anyone taking it seriously as a blueprint for anything, let alone fascist-fighting. This deliberate unreality seems inspired by Quentin Tarantino’s 2009 “Inglourious Basterds,” a film in which Hitler is killed in 1944, a year before the war actually ended, saving immeasurable suffering and misery. He’s assassinated by a group of awesome Jewish fighters and plotters, providing a satisfying revenge arc and a violent orgy of poetic justice.\n“Inglourious Basterds” is a tour de force of wish fulfillment; it’s not just satisfying, but painfully poignant, because you know, and you know Tarantino knows, that the war did not happen like that. The (relatively) easy victory underlines the truth that the cost of fighting fascism is higher than can possibly be conveyed in a revenge fantasy or movie.\n“Ungentlemanly Warfare” is by no means that smart or that powerful. But its cheerful pulp genre dreamworld in which the right guys win still has a knowing, innocent charm. At least its tongue-in-cheek approach means that no one is likely to come away from it thinking that a muscley invulnerable Danish dude really won World War II single-handed with a bow and arrow.\nWhen talented directors, actors, special effects crews and camera teams put all of their resources into convincing audiences that what they’re seeing on screen is What War Is Really Like, they can make even sophisticated viewers feel like they have been given a glimpse of something authentic, even when they’ve been fed a myth or an outright lie.\nHow many people who watched “Apocalypse Now” think that Vietnam during the war was a barely developed jungle, rather than a crowded and urbanized society? How many people who watched “Full Metal Jacket” took the hyper sexualization of Asian women as gospel?\nEven when a war movie doesn’t actively mislead you, the promise of being privy to an unvarnished, authentic and extreme experience can be seductive. Violent imagery of war doesn’t necessarily lead people to fear war; sometimes it fascinates, or makes them breathe “hard core,” as one character famously does in the climactic moments of “Full Metal Jacket.”\n\nIf you set war up as the realest thing, many people (and especially many young men) will want to go to war so they can say that they experienced the most real thing. That was one of the ways Hitler sought to justify his endless militarism to the Germans. Mankind has grown great in eternal war,” he wrote. “It would decay in eternal peace.”\nCompared to that kind of cult of authentic war, “Ungentlemanly Warfare” feels fairly harmless, and not in a bad way. The combat sequences are efficient and anodyne; they make no effort to overpower you.\nIt’s a fun bauble to watch, not an important window into a vital experience that you should, or need to, live out yourself. I wouldn’t want all movies to be this unambitious, but there is something to be said for a movie that knows it’s a movie, not an authentic experience of war.\n",

View more opinion on CNN.\nThis piece contains mild spoilers for the Netflix series “Ripley” and a scene in the movie “Civil War.”\nAre we finally ready to take another look at why we love to hate sociopaths so much? The answer to that question may depend on how you feel about empathy.\nAn interesting thing happens with Andrew Scott’s portrayal of Tom Ripley in the gorgeous new Netflix adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s novel: He almost disappears into Ripley’s utter lack of charisma.\nThat’s no ding on Scott, who’s incredibly watchable as always. But his rendition of Ripley – highly capable, chameleonic, but never what you’d call charming — represents a refreshing take on one of the most famous sociopaths in literature and film. Some of the most riveting pieces of Steven Zaillian’s new series focus on the grunt work of being a murderous grifter, delving into the messy, frustrating and exhausting aftermath of two murders. Trust Scott to make scrubbing chunky bloodstains off marble stairs absolutely compelling, but it’s not exactly the kind of behavior that makes you come away thinking “that guy’s cool.”\nHis acclaimed performance is one of two new meditations on the concept of the sociopath, an archetype that’s grown a bit stale in pop-cultural consciousness lately. On the one hand, we expect the sociopath to be a menacing figure — and at the same time, more often than not, we kind of expect to root for them. But “Ripley,” along with other recent portrayals of sociopathy, makes the case that it’s ﻿both more interesting and more useful to view sociopathy through a nuanced lens.\nThat’s not to say viewers aren’t entitled to live vicariously through whomever they like — escapism is an invaluable coping mechanism — but we’re living in what Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin has dubbed an “empathy gap,” so it might be a good moment to just take a tiny step back from lionizing stone-cold sociopaths, for whom empathy is not a concern. “It’s fair to conclude we have a serious empathy deficit — a collective inability (or refusal) to see the world from others’ perspectives, to understand people’s fears and hopes and our shared humanity,” wrote Rubin last year.\nRelated article\nWhy ‘Succession’ is starting to fall flat\nTraditionally, the majority of our cherished sociopathic antiheroes in TV and film have been men. Think Tony Soprano, Walter White, Patrick Bateman, Dexter Morgan, Don Draper. I’ve always found it difficult to love mob movies and series: Despite being ostensibly about the horrors of brute violence, “The Sopranos” and “Goodfellas” and all the rest have a singularly passionate fanbase that seems to really have fallen in love with their central villains.\nThis is a notion the New Yorker’s Emily Nussbaum has labeled the “bad fan,” a viewer who misses the critical lens through which a character is presented and instead goes all-in on identifying with them. She traces this dissonance back to Norman Lear’s “All in the Family,” the groundbreaking satirical sitcom of the 1970s whose bigoted lead character Archie Bunker, played by Carroll O’Connor, spawned, despite Lear’s intentions, genuine fans of the character’s behavior, those “who shared Archie’s frustrations with the culture around him, a ‘silent majority’ who got off on hearing taboo thoughts said aloud.”\nOne of the most prominent modern examples of mass bad-fan-baiting is the highly bingeable series “You,” Netflix’s thriller about a bibliophile sociopath with a long trail of bodies in his wake. Star Penn Badgley has taken thirsty fans to task repeatedly on social media, but his Joe Goldberg has continued to be as much a fan-fave as he is a walking, talking red flag representative of the worst the male species has to offer.\nThis month, though, the release of “Ripley” coincided with the arrival of the memoir “Sociopath,” which offers a quite different case for demythologizing the disorder. Author Patric Gagne, a successful therapist who’s married with kids, writes of her lifelong (and largely successful) struggle to quash her more violent urges, and argues that the condition is widely misunderstood, grossly stereotyped, and likely under-diagnosed.\nRelated article\n‘Ripley’ slowly builds a hypnotic series around the talented Andrew Scott\nGagne feels Hollywood’s nearly always gotten it wrong with portrayals of sociopaths, reducing them to a collection of cartoonish, villainous traits. “Contrary to popular belief, there’s nothing inherently immoral about having a limited emotional range,” she wrote in Vogue. “The majority of those whose personalities fall on the sociopathic spectrum have the ability to lead perfectly happy, socially acceptable roles in loving family units. But you wouldn’t know that from common discourse. Television’s talking heads, newspaper articles, and countless magazine headlines continue to disparage and vilify sociopaths, usually by erroneously conflating them with malignant narcissists or stereotyping us based on the worst examples of our personality type – serial killers and monsters.”\nFor her part, Gagne sees a heartening trend in more recent depictions of sociopathic characters such as Jenna Ortega as the often-icy Wednesday Addams on the Netflix show bearing her name. And in Gagne’s telling, the fact that pop cultural depictions are becoming more diverse is testament to how many kinds of people see a bit of themselves there.\nIn fact, I found one of film’s most recent sociopaths to be singularly chilling because of his very plausibility. He’s in Alex Garland’s “Civil War,” the polarizing film about a vaguely-sketched conflict set in the modern-day United States. Jesse Plemons — like Scott, an actor who has delivered uniformly bravura performances — appears in a lone scene you’ll be thinking about for days afterward. His soldier character, wearing rose-colored glasses in a morbidly funny detail, interrogates the film’s central group of journalists about “what kind of Americans” they are —  and shoots the ones who don’t answer to his satisfaction. He’s a very obvious White nationalist and, in critic Owen Gleiberman’s description, a sociopath.\n\n“Garland invests the sequence with a hair-trigger tension, and we recognize, in the Plemons character’s attitude, a reflection of current jingoistic hatred,” Gleiberman wrote. “For a few moments, the movie looks like a reflection of part of America today.” It’s a scene so completely galling it makes it hugely difficult to come away with any kind of admiration in your heart for Plemons, nor a view that he’s any kind of anti-hero.\nFor a country currently grappling with the notion of whether empathy is a strength or a weakness, throwing cold water on easy stereotypes about sociopathy is probably a good thing. If we can embrace the mundane complexity of Scott’s repellent Ripley, and at the same time come to understand that real-life sociopathy is not black and white thanks to authors like Gagne, we’ll be better equipped to understand them. Including the ones taking up a lot of real estate in the public consciousness right now.\n",

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\nUnrest on college campuses is driven in part by an opposition to an unpopular Democratic president’s support for Israel. Add in the fact that Democrats are holding their national convention in Chicago this year, and it’s not hard to hear echoes of 1968, when the protest movement collided with mainstream politics.\nThe pro-Palestinian movement in the US today is a far cry from the anti-war movement of the 1960s, but the angst and frustration of young Americans is clear and growing. It extends far beyond their views of the Middle East, and it is a major threat to President Joe Biden’s campaign to keep Donald Trump from returning to the White House.\nYoung voters are part of Democrats’ natural base of support, but Biden is actually 11 percentage points behind Trump among young voters 18-34 in a head-to-head match in a CNN poll conducted by SSRS and released over the weekend.\nAmong all Americans, about half – 47% of registered voters in CNN’s poll – said they were satisfied with the candidates they have to choose from for president this year. That figure was dragged down by the fact that just 37% of younger voters said they were satisfied.\nWhen other potential candidates are added in, more than one-fifth of registered voters 18-34 say they support Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in his independent bid. Older voters are less likely to say they support Kennedy.\nBiden is under water in every issue asked about in the CNN poll, according to Jennifer Agiesta, CNN’s polling director. Agiesta writes:\nRelated article\nWill the economy affect your vote in November? Share your story\nAnd his worst issue approval rating – for his handling of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza – yields 28% approval to 71% disapproval, including an 81% disapproval mark among those younger than 35 and majority disapproval among Democrats (53%).\nAsked whether they view Biden’s presidency as a success or a failure, 68% of younger Americans said it’s a failure, more than other age groups – and despite his high-profile efforts to address other issues of importance to young voters, including student debt relief.\nBiden fares worse in this poll among young voters than other recent CNN polling, according to Agiesta, although she adds some important context that many young people don’t vote and their views are not consistently reflected in polls.\nAGIESTA: Biden’s deficit with voters in that group is driven largely by those who did not vote in 2020. With that group excluded, voters between the ages of 18 and 34 in this poll divide 46% for Biden to 47% for Trump.\nAlthough not all polls release crosstabs or use the same age breaks when reporting results, other recent polling has shown a wide range of results for younger voters in testing a matchup between Trump and Biden, ranging from an 18-point Trump advantage among those younger than 30 in the Fox News poll in mid-March up to a 21-point Biden advantage among those younger than 30 in the Pew Research survey earlier this month.\nThe Republican pollster Frank Luntz recently shared video with CNN’s Erica Hill of focus groups he conducted with young people in which he asked whether they regard American democracy as strong. Few raised their hands.\n“They don’t like anybody,” Luntz told Hill. “They see Joe Biden as being too old. They see Donald Trump as being corrupt. … They’re looking for a role model, looking for someone to aspire to be. And they don’t see it. And that’s the frustration.”\nIt’s not just Biden and politics that are turning off young Americans. Just 38% of younger Americans in CNN’s poll said they are satisfied with their personal financial situation. Compare that with the 65% of voters 65 and over who are satisfied.\nHarvard University conducts a nationwide poll of young Americans ages 18-29 each year, and in this year’s edition, fewer than 1 in 10 said the nation was headed in the right direction, and 58% said the country was going “off on the wrong track.” Four years ago, more than 20% in the Harvard poll said the country was headed in the right direction.\nThe erosion of optimism among this key group during his presidency will be difficult for Biden and Democrats to correct before Election Day.\n",

It will include critical interceptors for Ukraine’s patriot and NASAMS air defense systems, more counter drone systems and support equipment, significant amounts of artillery ammunition, and air to ground munitions and maintenance and sustainment support,” Austin said during a press conference on Friday.\nThe announcement comes just days after the US announced a $1 billion package that would quickly provide equipment to Ukraine from US stocks, following President Joe Biden’s signing of a much delayed $95 billion supplemental aid package on Wednesday.\nBiden said moments after signing the legislation that shipments of aid to Ukraine would begin within hours. Equipment under the $6 billion package announced Friday, however, will take much longer to arrive.\nUnlike drawdown packages which pull military equipment directly from US stocks, Friday’s aid announcement falls under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), which contracts with industry to procure the equipment. The USAI is intended to provide Ukraine with a long-term supply of weapons and equipment.\nAustin said Friday that the timeline for delivery would depend on what systems are purchased, but that the Pentagon is “going to move as fast as we can to get them the capability as fast as industry can produce.”\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. CQ Brown, speaking alongside Austin on Friday, said that the USAI package would provide Ukraine with “more flexibility.”\n“They’ve had to actually ration conserve munitions over time,” Brown said. “And so with this package, and the follow-on factors because of the supplemental, gives them a bit more flexibility to be able to operate and use that capability effectively against the Russian threat.”\nAustin and Brown’s press conference followed the virtual Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting on Friday morning, held two years to the day since the very first meeting in Germany.\nAhead of the meeting’s start, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the group of allies, thanking them for their support but also urging them to send more assistance, particularly with air defense.\nAustin commended the Ukrainians during Friday’s press conference for being “able to hold their own” without significant support from the US over the last few months, and said the capabilities that will start flowing in will help them “do a lot better.”\n“As I talked to Ukrainian leadership, they are confident that they can continue to hold their own and then and then, as they get a bit stronger, they’ll have options available,” he said.\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n",

        "content": "President Joe Biden went on “The Howard Stern Show” on Friday and repeated his familiar story about the time he supposedly “got arrested” trying to defend the civil rights of Black Americans.\nAs in the past, Biden told the story on Friday while recounting what his mother supposedly said while urging him to accept Barack Obama’s 2008 offer to be his running mate. His mom, he said, did not want him to turn down a man who was vying to become the first Black president.\nBiden told Stern: “She said, ‘Joey, let me — remember’ — true story, she said —  ‘Remember when they were desegregating Lynnfield, the neighborhood … suburbia — and I told you — and there was a Black family moving in and there was — people were down there protesting; I told you not to go down there and you went down, remember that? And you got arrested standing on the porch with a Black family? And they brought you back, the police?’ And I said, ‘Yeah, Mom, I remember that.’”\nFacts First: There is no evidence Biden ever got arrested during a civil rights protest, as The Washington Post and PolitiFact found when they looked into this claim in 2022 — and Biden has at least twice told the story of his supposed presence at this particular Delaware protest without mentioning any arrest, instead claiming that the police merely took him home that day.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.\nThe Post noted that in the version of the story Biden told during a public conversation with Oprah Winfrey late in the 2020 presidential campaign, he said the police escorted him home from the protest because they thought he would get in trouble; he did not say they arrested him.\nThe Post reported that he told Winfrey his mother said: “And there were people protesting and I told you not to go down there and you went down and the police brought you back because you were standing on the step with the Black family.You were standing with them. And the police brought you home because they thought you’d get in trouble.” He told Winfrey that he responded, “Yeah, Mom, I remember that.”\nAs the Post and PolitiFact also noted, Biden’s 2017 memoir included an abbreviated version of the story about his mother’s 2008 comments urging him to accept Obama’s running mate offer, but it made no mention of an arrest. No other Biden memoir, either, says he was arrested at such a protest.\nThe Post and PolitiFact did find that there were protests roughly matching Biden’s description in early 1959, when Biden was 16 years old, in communities not far from Biden’s home in Delaware. Crowds protested against a Black couple that had bought a home in a previously all-White community and against the realtor who sold it to them.\nBut the Wilmington News Journal reported that the four teenagers arrested at the protest at the couple’s home were arrested for possessing fireworks — and that all seven of the arrests that day were of people in the anti-integration crowd outside the home. The newspaper reported that the police on scene were defending the home and the Black couple. It also quoted one member of the couple as saying, “Nobody’s behind us.”\nIt’s impossible to definitively prove whether or not Biden was present at this protest or any similar protest 60-plus years ago. (Biden’s mother died in 2010.)\nPrevious false claims\nBiden has made a series of false claims about his personal past in the last two weeks. They include the false claim that he “used to drive an 18-wheeler” and the false claim that he has never earned $400,000 in a year.\nAnd while running for president in 2020, Biden claimed he was “arrested” as a US senator as he tried to visit South African anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela while Mandela was imprisoned. After media outlets found no evidence of such an arrest, Biden told CNN that he had been “stopped” in South Africa but did not mean to say arrested.\n",

Kristi Noem defended actions described in her upcoming book in which she killed a dog and goat on her family farm.\nAccording to an excerpt, which was obtained by the Guardian, Noem killed her dog Cricket because the dog was “untrainable,” “dangerous to anyone she came in contact with” and “less than worthless … as a hunting dog.”\n“I hated that dog,” Noem writes, according to the Guardian.\nIn the excerpt, Noem writes she attempted to tame the dog, who she said behaved “like a trained assassin,” with an electronic collar, but ultimately made the decision to put her down by shooting her in a gravel pit after an incident in which the dog attacked a local family’s chickens and bit her.\n“It was not a pleasant job,” Noem writes, according to the Guardian, “but it had to be done. And after it was over, I realized another unpleasant job needed to be done.”\nNext, the Guardian quotes excerpts of the book in which Noem shoots a goat in the same manner. Noem describes the goat as “nasty and mean” and having a “disgusting, musky, rancid” smell. The goat made a habit of chasing and knocking down her kids, Noem adds.\nAiming to distinguish herself from typical politicians, Noem writes, “I guess if I were a better politician I wouldn’t tell the story here.”\nPosting a picture of the Guardian article, Noem said that her actions were not unusual on a farm.\n“We love animals, but tough decisions like this happen all the time on a farm. Sadly, we just had to put down 3 horses a few weeks ago that had been in our family for 25 years. If you want more real, honest, and politically INcorrect stories that’ll have the media gasping, preorder ‘No Going Back,’” Noem posted Friday on X, sharing a link to her book.\nFollowing backlash surrounding the story, Noem on Sunday issued another statement defending her actions as lawful.\n“Whether running the ranch or in politics, I have never passed on my responsibilities to anyone else to handle. Even if it’s hard and painful. I followed the law and was being a responsible parent, dog owner, and neighbor,” Noem said in a post on X.\nIn her post, Noem pointed to a South Dakota law allowing for dogs that attack and kill other domestic animals to be killed.\n“The fact is, South Dakota law states that dogs who attack and kill livestock can be put down. Given that Cricket had shown aggressive behavior toward people by biting them, I decided what I did,” Noem said.\nNoem, a staunch Trump supporter, is one of several politicians whom Trump has acknowledged are on his running mate shortlist.\nEarlier in April, Noem told CNN’s Dana Bash that she would support Trump even if he is convicted in the New York hush money trial.\nAmid the speculation over her potential as Trump’s vice president continues, Noem would not say whether she would have certified the 2020 election if she were in the same position as former Vice President Mike Pence.\nShe tied for first choice in a February poll at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February in which attendees were asked who they’d like to see Trump pick as his running mate. Noem and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy each received 15% of votes in the straw poll.\nDuring the conference, the South Dakota governor took a crack at those who entered the 2024 Republican primary against Trump, suggesting they got into the race for “personal benefit” and “a spotlight for a period of time.”\n“I was one of the first people to endorse Donald J. Trump as president. Last year, when everyone was asking me if I was going to consider running for president, I said no. Why would you run for president if you can’t win?” Noem said.\nThis story has been updated with new information.\nCNN’s Shania Shelton contributed to this report.\n",

He was not involved in the research.\nThe sample was made up of people with European ancestry so it is limited in the populations to which it can be applied, Shadyab added.\nThe researchers gave each individual a polygenetic risk score, which is a score summarizing the presence of multiple genes found to impact human lifespan, according to the study. The study participants also received a score based on how they adhered to healthy lifestyle tenets, and then were followed for an average of 13 years to see if they had a short, intermediate or long lifespan.\nEveryone, regardless of their genetic risks, were 78% more likely to die early if they had an unhealthy lifestyle, the data showed.\nAnd people with both a genetic risk for a short lifespan and an unhealthy lifestyle were twice as likely to die early as those without genetic risk and healthier lifestyles, said Li, who is also director of National Institute for Data Science in Health and Medicine of Zhejiang University.\nIndividuals with genetic risk could extend their lifespan by up to 5.5 years with a healthy lifestyle, the data showed.\n“Adherence to a healthy lifestyle could substantially attenuate the lifespan reduction for individuals with genetic susceptibility to a shorter lifespan,” Li said.\nThe study was observational, meaning that it could determine associations but could not say for sure that the behaviors were the direct cause of the changes in lifespan.\nBut researchers were able to identify four factors that were associated with the biggest impact on risk of early death.\n“The study identified an optimal lifestyle combination containing four lifestyle factors — no current smoking, regular physical activity, adequate sleep duration, and a healthy diet — that offered better benefits for prolonging human lifespan,” Li said.\nAdequate sleep was defined in the study as seven to eight hours a night. The current Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity and two days of strength training a week for adults.\nModerate drinking in the US is defined as a limit of two drinks in a day for adult men and one drink in a day for adult women, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nBuilding a healthier lifestyle may sound like a major undertaking, but manageable steps can help you get there.\nThere are phone helplines, apps and support groups that can help you quit smoking.\nA CDC funded tobacco cessation hotline, 1-800-QUIT-NOW (784-8669), is free to US residents in all states, plus the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico.\nRelated article\nYou can fight existing signs of dementia with a healthy lifestyle, a new study suggests\nCommitting to alcohol-free days or even challenges such as Dry January or Sober October can help you reassess your relationship with alcohol and reset your habits around it, journalist Rosamund Dean, author of “Mindful Drinking: How Cutting Down Can Change Your Life,” said in a previous CNN article.\nFor a healthier, longer life, many studies have shown support for the Mediterranean diet, a style of eating that focuses on plant-based cooking heavy on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, seeds and olive oil. Red meat is used sparingly.\nWhen it comes to catching enough z’s, if you can’t seem to get those seven or eight hours of sleep, try establishing a sleep routine, getting out of bed when you can’t sleep, and keeping the bedroom cool, dark and free of electronics.\nAnd if you’ve tried and failed to build an exercise routine you can stick to, make it a part of your everyday routine, starting slowly and choosing an activity you enjoy to get your exercise.\n",

        "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\nGeorge Mallory is renowned for being one of the first British mountaineers to attempt to scale the dizzying heights of Mount Everest during the 1920s — until the mountain claimed his life.\nNearly a century later, newly digitized letters shed light on Mallory’s hopes and fears about ascending Everest, leading up to the last days before he disappeared while heading for its peak.\nOn June 8, 1924, Mallory and fellow climber Andrew Irvine departed from their expedition team in a push for the summit; they were never seen alive again.\nMallory’s words, however, are now available to read online in their entirety for the first time. Magdalene College, Cambridge, where Mallory studied as an undergraduate from 1905 to 1908, recently digitized hundreds of pages of correspondence and other documents written and received by him.\nOver the past 18 months, archivists scanned the documents in preparation for the centennial of Mallory’s disappearance. The college will display a selection of Mallory’s letters and possessions in the exhibit “George Mallory: Magdalene to the Mountain,” opening June 20.\nThe Everest letters outline Mallory’s meticulous preparations and equipment tests, and his optimism about their prospects. But the letters also show the darker side of mountaineering: bad weather, health issues, setbacks and doubts.\nDays before his disappearance, Mallory wrote that the odds were “50 to 1 against us” in the last letter to his wife, Ruth, dated May 27, 1924.\n“This has been a bad time altogether,” Mallory wrote. “I look back on tremendous efforts & exhaustion & dismal looking out of a tent door and onto a world of snow & vanishing hopes.”\nHe went on to describe a harrowing brush with death during a recent climb, when the ground beneath his feet collapsed, leaving him suspended “half-blind & breathless,” his weight supported only by his ice axe wedged across a crevasse as he dangled over “a very unpleasant black hole.”\nOther letters Mallory exchanged with Ruth were written at the time of their courtship, while he was serving in Britain’s artillery regiment during World War I. Throughout his travels, correspondence from Ruth provided him with much-needed stability during the most challenging times, said project lead Katy Green, a college archivist at Magdalene College.\n“She was the ‘rock’ at home, he says himself in his letters,” Green said. The archivist recounted one note in which Mallory told Ruth: “I’m so glad that you never wobble, because I would wobble without you.”\nYet while Mallory was clearly devoted to his wife, he nonetheless repeatedly returned to the Himalayas despite her mounting fears for his safety.\n“There’s something in him that drove him,” Green said. “It might have been his wartime experience, or it might have just been the sort of person that he was.”\nIn total, the collection includes around 840 letters spanning from 1914 to 1924; Ruth wrote about 440 of those to Mallory, offering an unprecedented and highly detailed view of daily life for women in the early 20th century, Green told CNN.\nTogether, the letters offer readers a rare glimpse of the man behind the legend, said Jochen Hemmleb, an author and alpinist who was part of the Everest expedition that found Mallory’s body in 1999.\n“They are really personal. They are documents of his character. They provide unique insights into his life, and especially into the 1924 expedition — his state of mind, his accurate planning, his ambitions,” said Hemmleb, who was not involved in the scanning project. “It’s such a treasure that these are now digitized and available for everyone to read.”\nThree of the digitized letters — written to Mallory by his brother, his sister and a family friend — were recovered from Mallory’s body by the Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition, which ascended Everest seeking the remains of Mallory and Irvine.\nOn May 1, 1999, expedition member and mountaineer Conrad Anker found a frozen corpse at an altitude of around 26,700 feet (8,138 meters) and identified it as Mallory’s from a name tag that was sewn into his clothes.\nMallory’s body was interred where it lay at the family’s request, said Anker, who was not involved in the letter digitizing project.\n“Having done body recoveries in other places, it’s very laborious, and it’s very dangerous at that altitude,” he told CNN. “We collected some of his personal effects that went back to the Royal Geographical Society,” including the three letters that were later scanned at Magdalene College.\nMount Everest, the highest peak in the Himalayan mountain range, is also the tallest mountain on Earth, rising 29,035 feet (8,850 meters) above sea level on the border between Nepal and Tibet — an autonomous region in China. Its Tibetan name is Chomolungma, meaning “Goddess Mother of the World,” and its Nepali name is Sagarmatha, meaning “Goddess of the Sky.”\nHowever, these names were unknown to 19th century British surveyors who mapped the region, and in 1865 the Royal Geographical Society named the peak Mount Everest after British surveyor Sir George Everest, a former surveyor general of India.\nMallory participated in all three of Britain’s first forays onto Everest’s slopes: in 1921, 1922 and 1924. When he vanished in 1924, he was less than two weeks shy of his 38th birthday.\nMany have speculated about whether Mallory and Irvine managed to reach Everest’s summit. The climbers were last seen in the early afternoon of June 8 by expedition member and geologist Noel Odell, who was following behind and glimpsed them from a distance. Odell later found some of their equipment at a campsite, but there was no trace of Mallory and Irvine.\nRelated article\n‘You will be shocked what you can pull off.’ Lessons on achieving your dreams from women who did\n“(Mallory) risked a lot despite the fact that he had a family back home and three small children,” Hemmleb said. “We don’t know whether it was really irresponsible to make that final attempt, because we don’t really know what happened. It could be that in the end, he simply had bad luck.”\nDecades after Mallory’s death, Sherpa Tenzing Norgay and New Zealand mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary became the first to reach Everest’s peak, summiting on May 29, 1953. In the years that followed, thousands attempted to climb Everest, with nearly 4,000 people reaching its summit. More than 330 climbers have died trying since modern records were kept, according to the Himalayan Database, which compiles records of all expeditions in the Himalayas; some of those bodies remain on the mountain, frozen where they fell and visible to climbers who pass them by.\n“If you’re out in this environment, you make peace with your own mortality and the deaths of others,” Anker said. “You’re above 8,000 meters, and when there are weather changes or your own systems cease to function due to the lack of oxygen, it gets serious really quickly.”\nRelated article\nMount Everest: Nepal to remove trash and dead bodies from world’s tallest mountain\nWhen mountaineers are close to a mountain’s summit, they sometimes proceed even under dangerous conditions due to so-called summit fever, a compulsion to reach the peak even at the cost of their own safety. It’s unknown whether Mallory was in the grip of summit fever when he died, but he might have thought that his reputation depended on summiting.\n“That was going to be the defining moment in his life,” Anker said.\nBy comparison, Mallory’s team member Edward Norton had attempted to summit four days earlier but turned back at roughly the same altitude where Mallory and Irvine were seen for the last time.\n“I had a conversation with one of Edward Norton’s sons a couple of years ago,” Hemmleb said. “When I asked him, do you think it was mere luck that your father survived and Mallory died? He said, ‘No, I think there was one difference: My father, Edward Norton, didn’t need the mountain.’”\nAs a climber himself, Hemmleb took that message to heart.\n“That is something I personally learned from Mallory,” he said. “You need to be very careful not to make yourself dependent on that summit success.”\nRelated article\nNepal to require all Mount Everest climbers to use a tracking chip\nA century has elapsed since Mallory’s death, but the digitizing of these letters assures that his story will keep being told, Hemmleb said.\n“This will continue beyond my own lifetime, I’m certain of that,” he added. “In a sense, it’s the expedition that never ends.”\nMindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine.\nCorrection: A previous version of this story misstated the nationality of Sir Edmund Hillary and, in a caption, the location of the base camp where Mallory and Irvine were last photographed.\n",

        "content": "Editor’s note: Dana Santas, known as the “Mobility Maker,” is a certified strength and conditioning specialist and mind-body coach in professional sports, and is the author of the book “Practical Solutions for Back Pain Relief.”\nWhen it comes to cardiovascular fitness, you may tend to focus on activities that move you forward, such as walking, running and cycling.\nLikewise, in weight training, most traditional exercises center on forward and backward motion, occurring in what’s known as the sagittal plane.\nBut there is another plane of movement that deserves your attention: the frontal plane, where movements go from side to side.\nIf the majority of your workouts take place in the sagittal plane, you risk creating muscular imbalances and leaving yourself susceptible to injury during lateral movements in everyday life. Incorporating frontal plane exercises, such as the side lunge, into your fitness routine can prepare your body to move better and be more durable in daily-life activities.\nThe side or lateral lunge is one of the best exercises for building lateral stability and mobility in the often neglected frontal plane. This exercise strengthens the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, adductors and core to help protect you against injuries such as groin pulls and hamstring tears. The side lunge also improves the mobility and stability of your hips, knees and ankles to avoid related strains and sprains.\nRelated article\nStretching isn’t always the answer for pain and muscle tension\nConsider the activities in your lifestyle that require you to move laterally and how side lunging could prove beneficial:\nNavigating crowded spaces: In environments such as busy streets, shopping malls or public transportation, you often need to sidestep or maneuver laterally to avoid obstacles, step off curbs and move through tight spaces. Training with side lunges can improve your ability to navigate these environments.\nHousehold chores: Tasks such as vacuuming, sweeping or mopping often require lateral motion as you move from side to side to clean different areas of your home. By strengthening the muscles involved in lateral movement with side lunges, you can accomplish these chores more efficiently while reducing your risk of muscle strain or injury.\nPlaying with children or pets: If you have kids or pets, you’re likely familiar with the need to move quickly and react to sudden changes in direction. Side lunges can improve your ability to change direction rapidly and maintain balance, helping to keep playtime pain-free.\nRecreational sports: Many recreational sports, including pickleball, tennis and basketball, involve lateral movements such as shuffling, cutting and sidestepping. Incorporating side lunges into your training regimen can enhance your lateral quickness, agility and overall performance in these sports.\nOutdoor activities: Whether you’re hiking on uneven terrain, walking in deep sand on the beach or participating in more extreme activities such as skiing or snowboarding, lateral stability and mobility are essential for navigating varied landscapes and maintaining balance. Training with side lunges can increase your lateral movement strength, enhance your mobility and boost your confidence to be more adventurous outdoors.\nRelated article\nDo these exercises for core strength if you can’t stomach doing planks\nEditor’s note: Consult your doctor before beginning any new exercise program. Stop immediately if you experience pain.\n1. Stand tall with your feet hip-width apart and toes pointed forward.\n2. With your hands on your hips or clasped in front of your chest, take a wide step to the side with your right foot, while your left foot remains firmly grounded.\n3. Bend your right knee to 90 degrees, aligned above your ankle, while pushing your hips back.\n4. Your left leg remains straight with both feet pointing forward.\n5. Although you will naturally hinge at your hips as you sit back, try not to lean forward too much. Keep your chest up as much as possible with your back neutral.\n6. You do not need to hold the side-lunge position for more than a second or two. Get into the position and then push through your right heel to return to the starting position.\n7. Repeat for 10 to 12 reps total on each side through two to three sets.\nDepending on your fitness level, you can lower or increase the suggested repetitions and set totals. I recommend adding side lunges to your workout routine at least twice weekly for best results.\nIf you don’t have the strength or mobility to step wide to the side or bend your knee all the way to 90 degrees, shorten your stance and/or how far you sit back and bend your knee. You can slowly increase your stance as you get stronger and more mobile.\nIf you struggle with strength or balance in this exercise, you can place an armless chair behind you on the side you are lunging, enabling you to sit back on the chair seat during each repetition. Also, if you have access to a suspension trainer, you can hold the straps for stability as you perform the exercise.\nRelated article\n6 exercises that address an often overlooked key to longevity\nTo increase the intensity, you can increase the speed of your repetitions.\nYou can make the exercise more dynamic with a greater focus on agility by alternating back and forth with a small jump in between as you shift from side to side.\nYou can also add weight by holding a kettlebell or dumbbell at chest height. Use the appropriate weight for your fitness level.\nRemember, moving laterally is a natural part of daily function, so incorporating side lunges into your workouts not only adds variety, it also plays a crucial role in enhancing your ability to move well and prevent injury. Next time you hit the gym or feel the need to move your body, remember your side lunges to unlock the full potential of your frontal plane fitness.\n",

I’m very proud of how they’ve overcome every single issue that we’ve encountered and gotten us to this point.”\nBoeing and NASA officials made the decision Thursday to move forward with the launch attempt in less than two weeks. However, Ken Bowersox, associate administrator for NASA’s Space Operations Mission Directorate, noted that May 6 is “not a magical date.”\nRelated article\nHow SpaceX and NASA overcame a bitter culture clash to bring back US astronaut launches\n“We’ll launch when we’re ready,” he said.\nIf successful, the Starliner will join SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft in making routine trips to the space station, keeping the orbiting outpost fully staffed with astronauts from NASA and its partner space agencies.\nSuch a scenario — with both Crew Dragon and Starliner flying regularly — is one for which the US space agency has long waited.\n“This is history in the making,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said of the upcoming Starliner mission during a March 22 news conference. “We’re now in the golden era of space exploration.”\nSpaceX and Boeing developed their respective vehicles under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, a partnership with private industry contractors. From the outset, the space agency aimed to have both companies operating at once. The Crew Dragon and Starliner spacecraft would each serve as a backup to the other, giving astronauts the option to keep flying, even if technical issues or other setbacks grounded one spacecraft.\nNASA did not initially envision, however, that SpaceX’s Crew Dragon would operate on its own for nearly four years before Boeing’s Starliner reached its first crewed test flight.\nIn the earliest days of the program, which awarded SpaceX and Boeing contracts in 2014, NASA had favored Boeing — a close partner dating back to the mid-20th century — over SpaceX, which the federal agency saw as a relatively young and capricious upstart.\nAs recently as 2016, NASA was planning its schedule with the view that the Starliner would beat the Crew Dragon to the launchpad.\nBut the race between Boeing and SpaceX took a clear turn by 2020. Missteps riddled a Starliner test flight the prior year, leaving NASA and Boeing officials scrambling to figure out what went wrong. The Starliner did not dock with the space station on that mission due to software problems, including an issue with the spacecraft’s internal clock, which was off by 11 hours.\nMeanwhile, SpaceX made history in May 2020 with the launch of its Demo-2 test flight, carrying astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley on a two-month mission to the International Space Station.\nSpaceX’s Crew Dragon has been flying routine trips ever since, carrying NASA astronauts and even paying customers and tourists. The spacecraft has now flown 13 crewed missions to orbit.\nRelated article\nBoeing mission to send NASA astronauts to space station faces more lengthy delays\nBoeing, however, has spent several years contending with a string of challenges, including a list of issues that were uncovered in 2022 during the spacecraft’s second uncrewed test flight. Boeing’s commercial airplane division also has faced a series of scandals — including the 737 Max crisis and the recent quality control issues highlighted after a door plug blew off during an Alaska Airlines flight in January — that have damaged the company’s brand.\nNASA officials at one point in 2020 even admitted that they had turned more scrutiny toward SpaceX and its unorthodox ways, while issues with Boeing’s Starliner slipped through the cracks.\n“Perhaps we didn’t have as many people embedded in that process as we should have,” Steve Stich, NASA’s Commercial Crew Program manager, said at a July 2020 news conference.\n“When one provider (SpaceX) has a newer approach than another, it’s often natural for a human being to spend more time on that newer approach, and maybe we didn’t quite take the time we needed with (Boeing’s) more traditional approach.”\nBoeing’s space division operates separately from its commercial airline team, and officials at NASA and the US aerospace giant have routinely sought to make that distinction.\nNASA officials have also made clear they are working more closely with Boeing than ever, with personnel on the ground at Boeing facilities overseeing some of the fixes the company has put in place ahead of the upcoming Starliner flight.\n“This is an important capability for NASA. We signed up to go do this, and we’re gonna go do it and be successful at it,” Nappi said Thursday. “I don’t think of it in terms of what’s important for Boeing as much as I think of it as in terms of what’s important for this program.”\nStill, Boeing and NASA have had a long list of issues to address.\nDuring the last flight test in 2022, for example, engineers found that the suspension lines on the Starliner’s parachute had a lower threshold for failure than initially expected.\nRelated article\nNASA says it expected space station garbage to burn up. The debris smashed into a Florida home instead\nNASA and Boeing engineers tested a fix for that issue earlier this year, but parachutes will remain top of mind as they work through some last-minute checkouts before liftoff, Stich said Thursday.\nSome tape that was also used to protect wiring harnesses was found to be flammable, and Boeing had to remove and replace about a mile’s worth of the material, according to Nappi.\nBoeing may even need to implement a redesign of some of the spacecraft’s valves because of corrosion issues. That upgrade, however, is not expected to be in place until the second crewed flight, slated for 2025, at the earliest.\nOn May’s inaugural crewed flight, Boeing will instead use a “perfectly acceptable mitigation” that should prevent the valves from sticking, Nappi said in March.\nDespite the long path to the launchpad, the two people at the center of the Starliner’s first crewed mission — Williams and Wilmore, two longtime NASA astronauts — said as they arrived at the launch site that they are as confident as ever.\n“We want the general public to think it’s easy, but it’s not — it’s way hard,” Wilmore said after arriving at Starliner’s launch site in Florida on Thursday. “We wouldn’t be here if we weren’t ready. We are ready. The spacecraft’s ready, and the teams are ready.”\nWilmore mentioned at a March news conference that he is not expecting the Starliner spacecraft to enter any “failure modes.”\nRelated article\n5 ways the Columbia disaster changed spaceflight forever\n“But if something were to occur — because we’re all humans, we can’t build things perfectly — if something were to occur, we have several downgrade modes,” he said during the news conference, referring to modes that give the astronauts the ability to take more manual control over the spacecraft if something doesn’t go to plan.\nWilliams said during a March news event, “We wouldn’t be sitting here if we didn’t feel — and tell our families that we feel — confident in this spacecraft and our capabilities to control it.”\nShe added during the Thursday news briefing in Florida, “I have all the confidence in not only our capabilities and the spacecraft’s capabilities, but also our mission control team, who’s ready for the challenge.”\n",

It depends on whom you ask.\nNaturalists have already spotted the first arrivals in a rare phenomenon during which cicadas will emerge this spring across more than a dozen US states — including populous areas like Chicago, Nashville and St. Louis — blanketing eastern parts of the country with billions, perhaps trillions, of the flying bugs.\nThe insects will infiltrate a much bigger geographical area than similar occurrences in most years because they’re part of the dual emergence of two particular periodical cicada broods. These groups of multiple Magicicada species appear like clockwork after a certain number of years, but the simultaneous appearance of these two broods hasn’t happened since 1803.\nThe Northern Illinois brood spends 17 years underground before emerging and is known as Brood XIII, while the Great Southern Brood, or Brood XIX, lives underground for 13 years. The two broods won’t coincide again until 2245.\nAlthough the full-scale emergence isn’t underway yet, experts have some guidance on how to prepare for cicada season.\nWhen small holes that can resemble tiny chimneys appear in the ground near tree roots, it’s a signal periodical cicadas will soon emerge from their underground lair.\nOnce the soil hits the right temperature, around 64 degrees Fahrenheit (17.8 degrees Celsius), cicada babies, called nymphs, begin to burst forth.\nRelated article\nBillions of cicadas are set to appear in a rare ‘double brood emergence,’ scientists say\nAs soon as they’re above ground, the bugs make a beeline for a vertical surface — typically a tree trunk, but it could be a fence. There they shed their hard outer skeletons and spread their wings for the first time before spending four to six weeks in a noisy frenzy of eating, mating and egg laying.\nThe most obvious sign of their arrival is the distinctive sound they make — a droning buzz. The bugs congregate in trees, and the male cicadas form a cacophonous chorus of thousands to attract mates.\n“When they say it’s as loud as a lawn mower, it is as loud as a lawn mower,” said Paula Shrewsbury, a professor in the department of entomology at the University of Maryland.\n“We live near an airport, and when the planes are flying over…cicadas crank up their sound level, it’s like they’re competing with the airplanes for sound,” Shrewsbury said.\nFemale cicadas use an egg-laying organ, called an ovipositor, to lay their eggs inside slits they cut into tree branches.\nHowever, cicadas are unlikely to cause any irreparable damage to plants, trees, vegetable patches or flower beds, said John Lill, a professor of biology at the George Washington University.\nIt’s possible that the insects could damage a very young sapling, and to prevent that you could cover the sapling with protective netting, Lill said.\nRelated article\nA strange fungus could transform emerging cicadas into ‘saltshakers of death,’ scientists say\nCicadas provide an all-you-can-eat buffet for many animals, including pets. Lill said he once had to take his dog to the vet after it gorged itself on cicadas, but the bugs — which are said to have a sweet, nutlike flavor— are not innately harmful when eaten by pets or humans.\n(Some advice for the gastronomically adventurous from the US Food and Drug Administration: Humans with seafood allergies should avoid eating cicadas, which are distantly related to shrimp and lobsters.)\nTry to replace fear with fascination, Lill advised, and remember cicadas, which are about an inch long, don’t bite or sting.\nView the dual emergence as a remarkable opportunity to see a glorious and mysterious natural phenomenon that has delighted people for centuries.\nDownload community science apps such as the Cicada Safari app and take photographs to help researchers studying these insects, which benefit the natural environment where they live: Cicada nymphs loosen and aerate the soil as they tunnel, and, when they die, they add nutrients to the soil.\nMore than 3,000 species of cicadas are found all around the globe, but just nine are periodical and, of those, seven are confined to the eastern United States.\nIt’s not clear why periodical cicadas evolved to emerge every 13 or 17 years. It’s an unusually long lifespan for an insect.\nHowever, for bug haters, Shrewsbury said staying indoors or timing a vacation with the peak of the emergence might be the best strategy.\n“They are so abundant. They’re flying and landing on you. They’re getting caught in your hair,” she added. “If you really are a cicadaphobe, I would plan a trip away.”\n",

        "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\nAncient DNA is spilling more secrets about the Avars, a fearsome people who built a mysterious empire that ruled much of Central and Eastern Europe for 250 years from the mid-sixth century.\nPrimarily known from the accounts of adversaries, the Avars confounded the Byzantines with formidable horseback warriors who appeared suddenly on their doorstep. The enigmatic nomads came en masse from the Mongolian steppe in what was one of the biggest and fastest long-haul migrations in ancient history.\nWith opulent graves but no written records, the empire and its people have remained largely in the shadows of history until recently. But a landmark April 2022 study involving ancient DNA taken from the graves of the Avar elite shed light on the empire’s far-flung origins.\nNow, a new study analyzing the remains of 424 people buried in four cemeteries unearthed in Hungary has revealed details about Avar family and social life and how the newcomers interacted with the population of their adopted homeland.\n“What surprised me most was the simple fact that these people in the cemeteries are so interconnected,” said Zsófia Rácz, a researcher at Eötvös Loránd University’s Institute of Archaeological Sciences in Budapest, Hungary. Rácz was a study coauthor of the latest report.\nThe researchers were able to build detailed family trees or pedigrees, the largest of which spanned nine generations across 2 ½ centuries. The team discovered that around 300 of the individuals had a close relative buried in the same cemetery.\nThe analysis showed that men stayed in their community after marriage, while women married outside their original community — a pattern known as patrilocality.\n“For all the mothers, we don’t find the parents. The parents aren’t at the site. While all the males are the descendants of the founders,” said Guido Alberto Gnecchi-Ruscone, lead author of the study that appeared Wednesday in the journal Nature.\nStudy of mitochondrial DNA, which reveals the female line, showed a high variability, suggesting that the women who married into the Avar groups were from different places, according to Gnecchi-Ruscone, a postdoctoral researcher of archaeogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. They still shared a “steppe” genetic ancestry, indicating that they were probably not conquered local people.\nWhat’s more, the study found, it was relatively common for both men and women in Avar society to have children with multiple partners.\nIn the case of men, researchers found two partners in 10 cases, three partners in four cases and four partners in one case. Having multiple wives may have been relatively common in the general population as well as the elite, the study authors wrote.\nThe team also uncovered multiple cases of closely related male individuals having offspring with the same female partner: three pairs of fathers and sons, two pairs of full brothers, and one sibling of paternal half brothers and an uncle and nephew.\nSimilar “levirate unions” that took place after the death of the woman’s husband existed in other Eurasian steppe societies, according to the study, and suggests that the Avars, who abandoned their nomadic way of life based on herding and became more settled shortly after arriving in Europe, clung to some aspects of their former way of life.\nLara Cassidy, a geneticist and assistant professor at Trinity College Dublin who was not involved in the new research, said the authors had “deftly unravelled” the organizing principles of this medieval society, providing “compelling evidence for a rigid patrilineal system, in which children belong to their father’s family and ancestry is traced from father to son.”\nWriting in a commentary published alongside the research, she largely agreed with the authors’ explanation for multiple reproductive partners.\n“Polygamy (having multiple marriage partners), serial monogamous marriages and extramarital relations are all possible explanations,” she said.\n“However, two cases of men with multiple older female partners, all middle-aged at death, makes a good argument for polygyny (having multiple wives). By contrast, most of the cases of women with multiple partners were apparent levirate unions, in which a widow would marry the son or brother of the deceased. This is a common custom in pastoralists … both providing for widows and obliging them to fulfil marriage contracts that are conditional on them bearing male heirs.”\nGnecchi-Ruscone said the biological continuity in the tight-knit population the researchers studied was striking, especially given that there was no sign of interbreeding between close blood relatives — a phenomenon known as consanguinity.\n“Even more distant interbreeding like (between) cousins or second cousins, it leaves traces genetically. And we see absolutely no consanguinity in these individuals,” he said.\n“This really tells us that they knew who their biological relatives were, and they traced their biological relatives over the generations.”\nIt wasn’t possible to understand the gender power dynamics of the community through the study of ancient DNA alone, Gnecchi-Ruscone said.\nBurials of men were more likely to include high-status grave goods such as horses, saddles and harnesses, Rácz said. However, women likely played a role in promoting social cohesion linking individual communities.\nCassidy said that the oral history of female-line genealogy may have been important for the Avars, ensuring that daughters did not take husbands from among their mothers’ or grandmothers’ kin.\nAvar graves — around 100,000 have been excavated so far — form an important part of Europe’s archaeological heritage.\nThe Avars were once part of what the Chinese called the Rouran khaganate or confederation of tribes, which the Turks defeated in 550, forcing the Avars to flee westward.\nTraveling more than 5,000 kilometers (3,100 miles) in a few years from Mongolia to the Caucasus, according to the 2022 study published in the journal Cell that pinpointed the group’s Asian ancestry, the Avars set up a base in what’s now Hungary and came close to crushing Constantinople, the center of the Byzantine Empire.\nSome historians credit the Avars with bringing the stirrup to Europe — a transformative technology that made mounted warfare possible and was subsequently widely adopted across the continent.\nRelated article\nAncient DNA reveals intriguing details about a sixth century Chinese emperor\nThe study was a “fruitful interweaving of genetics, history, and archaeology,” according to Bryan Miller, an assistant professor of Central Asian art and archaeology at the University of Michigan, who wasn’t involved in the study.\n“Many previous studies have purported to sweep across the entirety of Eurasia with a wide population, relying on one individual per community or a handful of individuals to represent an entire culture or society,” he said via email.\n“Instead, this study shows how only a data set with far greater resolution, with fuller investigations of whole communities, can provide the kinds of definitive or nuanced narratives that the earlier big data studies attempted to provide.”\n",

Congress is running out of time to respond\nThe collection of experts will make recommendations to telecommunications companies, pipeline operators, electric utilities and other sectors about how they can “responsibly” use AI, DHS said. The group will also help prepare those sectors for “AI-related disruptions.”\n“Artificial intelligence is a transformative technology that can advance our national interests in unprecedented ways,” said DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, in a release. “At the same time, it presents real risks — risks that we can mitigate by adopting best practices and taking other studied, concrete actions.”\nAmong the panel’s other participants are the CEOs of technology providers such as Amazon Web Services, IBM and Cisco; chipmakers such as AMD; AI model developers such as Anthropic; and civil rights groups such as the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.\nIt also includes federal, state and local government officials, as well as leading academics in AI such as Fei-Fei Li, co-director of Stanford University’s Human-centered Artificial Intelligence Institute.\nThe 22-member AI Safety and Security Board is an outgrowth of a 2023 executive order signed by President Joe Biden, who called for a cross-industry body to make “recommendations for improving security, resilience, and incident response related to AI usage in critical infrastructure.”\nThat same executive order also led this year to government-wide rules regulating how federal agencies can purchase and use AI in their own systems. The US government already uses machine learning or artificial intelligence for more than 200 distinct purposes, such as monitoring volcano activity, tracking wildfires and identifying wildlife from satellite imagery.\nMeanwhile, deepfake audio and video, which use AI to push fake content, have emerged as a key concern for US officials trying to protect the 2024 US election from rampant mis- and disinformation. A fake robocall in January imitating Biden’s voice urged Democrats not to vote in New Hampshire’s primary, sounding alarms among US officials focused on election security. A New Orleans magician told CNN that a Democratic political consultant hired him to make the robocall. But there is concern that foreign adversaries like Russia, China or Iran could exploit the same technology.\n“It is a risk that is real,” Mayorkas told reporters on Friday while discussing the AI advisory board. “We are seeing adverse nation-states engaged and we work to counter their efforts to unduly influence our elections.”\n",

        "content": "Alphabet, the parent company of Google, bounced back from an absolutely dreadful day for tech shares, as its stock surged Thursday after the closing bell. All it had to do was to hand out billions of dollars to investors.\nThe tech giant announced its first quarterly cash dividend, saying it will pay $0.20 per share on June 17 to shareholders of record as of June 10, as well as a $70 billion share buyback. Buybacks and dividends help to boost stock prices by rewarding investors with cash just for holding the stock — but they’re widely criticized for artificially inflating the stock price without spending on employees or improvements to the underlying business.\nGoogle’s stock jumped as much as 13% in after-hours trading following the report.\nThe announcement came as part of Google’s earnings report for the first three months of the year, in which it also reported that it exceeded Wall Street analysts’ expectations for both sales and profits.\nRelated article\nMeta’s stock plunges 15% on ‘aggressive’ AI spending plans\nRevenue from the quarter reached more than $80.5 billion, up 15% from the same period in the prior year and ahead of the $78.75 billion analysts had projected, according to FactSet estimates. The company also reported 57% year-over-year growth in profits to nearly $23.7 billion.\nAlphabet chief executive Sundar Pichai attributed the success to the company’s investments in artificial intelligence, including the large language model and suite of AI products it calls Gemini.\n“We are well under way with our Gemini era and there’s great momentum across the company. Our leadership in AI research and infrastructure, and our global product footprint, position us well for the next wave of AI innovation,” Pichai said.\nGoogle’s results were a sign of how investors may reward some tech companies for their investments in artificial intelligence, which many see as the future of the sector.\n“We have clear paths to AI monetization through ads and cloud, as well as subscriptions,” Pichai said on a call with analysts following Thursday’s report.\nBut not every company has successfully convinced investors that they’re investing in AI responsibly. Meta shares sank on Thursday after the company raised its annual expense forecast to fund its AI ambitions, despite better-than-expected earnings results Wednesday.\nBut in addition to Google, multiple positive tech earnings reports on Thursday helped reverse what had been a sluggish day for tech stocks.\nSocial media company Snap, the parent company of social media platform Snapchat, also saw its stock climb after-hours on the heels of a rosy first-quarter earnings report that beat Wall Street’s estimates.\nSnap reported revenue of some $1.19 billion for the first three months of the year, up 21% from the year-ago quarter. And it said daily active users increased 10% year-over-year. The company also offered a better-than-expected outlook for the current quarter.\nSnap has been working to improve its advertising technology and offerings, while undergoing a restructuring aimed at cutting costs. While it nonetheless reported a net loss of $305 million for the March quarter, it was an improvement from its loss a year ago and better than analysts expected.\nSnap shares soared roughly 25% in after-hours trading immediately following the report.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft reported quarterly profits of $21.9 billion, up from $18.3 billion a year ago, signaling that the company’s efforts to double down on AI are also paying off. Revenue grew 17% year-over-year to $61.9 billion.\n“Microsoft Copilot and Copilot stack are orchestrating a new era of AI transformation, driving better business outcomes across every role and industry,” chief executive officer Satya Nadella said in a statement, referring to Microsoft’s AI services.\nMicrosoft shares climbed more than 4% in after-hours trading Thursday.\nWhile rivals play catch up, Jeremy Goldman, a senior director at market research company eMarketer, wrote in an analyst note that it’s clear that Microsoft’s early bets on OpenAI’s ChatGPT are paying off through products like its Copilot for Microsoft365, an AI chat assistant built into its existing suite of business products.\n“Investors should keep an eye on potential AI overspending, but for now, Satya Nadella’s forward-looking strategy is building value by infusing productive intelligence across Microsoft’s entire portfolio, from the cloud to the desktop.”\nMicrosoft’s Azure cloud business also experienced strong growth – revenue grew 31% – boosted by AI tailwinds.\n",

        "content": "The US government on Thursday banned internet service providers (ISPs) from meddling in the speeds their customers receive when browsing the web and downloading files, restoring tough rules rescinded during the Trump administration and setting the stage for a major legal battle with the broadband industry.\nThe net neutrality regulations adopted Thursday by the Federal Communications Commission prohibit providers such as AT&T, Comcast and Verizon from selectively speeding up, slowing down or blocking users’ internet traffic. They largely reflect rules passed by a prior FCC in 2015 and unwound in 2017.\nThe latest rules show how, with a 3-2 Democratic majority, the FCC is moving to reassert its authority over an industry that powers the modern digital economy, touching everything from education to health care and enabling advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence.\nRelated article\nFCC rolls out mandatory ‘nutrition labels’ for internet providers’ plans\nWith Thursday’s party-line vote, the FCC redefined internet service as similar to legacy telephone lines, a sweeping move that comes with greater regulatory power over the broadband industry. And the FCC said it would step in to override state or local policies that conflict with the federal net neutrality rule.\nLeading FCC officials have said restoring net neutrality rules, and reclassifying ISPs under Title II of the agency’s congressional charter, would provide the FCC with clearer authority to adopt future rules governing everything from public safety to national security.\nSome of the issues the FCC will be further empowered to address after the change include spam robotexts, internet outages, digital privacy and expanding high-speed internet access, FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said when she first announced the proposal in September.\nOn Thursday, Rosenworcel added that the vote would also prevent internet providers from selling Americans’ personal data or sharing it with tech companies to train artificial intelligence models.\n“The action we take here is good for consumers, public safety, national security and network investment,” Rosenworcel said ahead of the vote.\nThe vote marks the latest twist in a years-long battle between regulators on the one hand, who say consumer protections are needed to ensure all websites are treated equally, and ISPs on the other who describe the rules as heavy-handed government intervention.\nFor years, consumer advocates have said that without net neutrality rules in place, ISPs would be free to charge websites and consumers extra fees — the equivalent of toll lanes for the internet — in order for some websites to be delivered faster than others. At a societal scale, that could give ISPs enormous power to shape what consumers can see and access on the internet, consumer groups say, and entrench their dominance in markets that lack competition.\n“Broadband is a telecommunications service and should be regulated as such,” said Justin Brookman, director for technology policy at Consumer Reports. “The Title II authority will ensure that broadband providers are properly overseen by the FCC like all telecommunications services should be. Whether it is throttling content, junk or hidden fees, arbitrary pricing, deceptive advertising or unreliable service, broadband providers have proven over the years that without proper oversight, they will not hesitate to use their power to increase profits at the expense of consumers.”\nThe broadband industry argues there is no risk of that happening because consumers would revolt. ISPs add that during the Trump and Biden administrations when the net neutrality rules were not in effect, providers did not engage in that type of content-based network manipulation. They have also claimed that the regulations could discourage them from building high-speed networks, although some academic research has shown little support for that claim.\n“These 400-plus pages of relentless regulation are proof positive that old orthodoxies die hard,” said Jonathan Spalter, CEO of USTelecom, a trade association representing internet providers. “This is a nonissue for broadband consumers, who have enjoyed an open internet for decades. Rather than pushing this harmful regulatory land grab, policymakers should keep their eyes on the real-world prize of building opportunity for everyone in a hyperconnected world.”\nUS policies for network providers have flip-flopped multiple times over the past decade with every change in administration in Washington.\nRepublican commissioners at the FCC blasted Thursday’s vote, accusing its Democratic leadership of touching “the third rail of communications policy.”\n“The internet in America has thrived in the absence of 1930s command-and-control regulation by the government,” said FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, describing the new rules as a power grab. “The FCC has identified no gap in national security,” he added, that the agency’s move would help fill.\nIndustry groups are widely expected to challenge the rules in court, in a significant new test of the federal government’s power.\nIn past legal battles over net neutrality, courts have deferred to the FCC, ruling that it has wide latitude to regulate ISPs as it sees fit using the authority it derives from the agency’s congressional charter, the Communications Act of 1934.\nBut courts’ longstanding deference to expert agencies appears increasingly in doubt as a conservative-leaning Supreme Court has sounded an increasingly skeptical tone on the reach of federal executive authority.\nAs a result, the outcome of a legal challenge to the FCC’s net neutrality rules could have potentially broad ramifications for other US regulatory bodies, not just the FCC.\nThis story has been updated to clarify the FCC has previously said it would intercede in state and local policies that conflict with its net neutrality rule.\n",

        "content": "The clock has begun ticking for TikTok to find a new owner.\nPresident Joe Biden signed legislation Wednesday that would ban TikTok in the United States unless its Chinese parent, ByteDance, sells the app. TikTok plans to challenge the law in court, but if it fails, the company would have to find a buyer, and fast.\nThat raises the question of who the US government might view as a suitable new owner of a social media platform with 170 million US users and a rising challenger to legacy social media giants such as Facebook-parent Meta.\nThe prospect of a TikTok sale could lead to a potential feeding frenzy, drawing out everyone from tech companies to retailers and private equity firms and investment bankers.\nAnd an added headache for any potential buyer: China’s commerce ministry has previously said it would “firmly oppose” any forced sale of TikTok.\nThere’s no apparent consensus on a favorite bidder yet. But some candidates seem more likely than others, legal experts and business analysts say.\nAny effort by an established tech giant with a large social media presence would immediately trigger antitrust red flags, according to analysts.\nMeta is already fighting a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit that alleges its purchase of WhatsApp and Instagram violated US antitrust law, and the FTC is actively seeking to break up the company.\nRelated article\nBanning TikTok would hit China’s tech ambitions and deepen the global digital divide\nGoogle is also fighting Justice Department antitrust suits on two fronts. These are related to its search and advertising technology businesses, not its ownership of YouTube. Still, the company is under such close scrutiny that it would be a poor candidate to buy TikTok, experts say.\n“If it’s Amazon, Microsoft, Google or Meta, I just think you’re going to see substantial antitrust concern,” said Gene Kimmelman, a former Justice Department antitrust official. “If you were to say, like, an Intel, or a Cisco, maybe Oracle, I don’t know. If you were to tell me it’s Verizon, or AT&T, maybe it’s not as big of a problem.”\nJasmine Enberg, principal analyst at Emarketer, highlighted a paradox: Only the largest, most dominant tech giants may have the resources to buy TikTok. But it may be they who would attract the most regulatory skepticism.\n“Any potential buyer must have deep pockets and a strong stomach,” Enberg said. “While many would want to get their hands on TikTok’s coveted algorithm, most of those who could afford to buy the app wouldn’t be able to clear antitrust hurdles.”\nMicrosoft recently attracted heaps of antitrust scrutiny when it sought to buy the video game publisher Activision Blizzard in one of the largest tech mergers in history. But it ultimately overcame an FTC lawsuit and placated other international regulators to close the blockbuster deal last fall.\nFresh off that success, Microsoft could find itself with a renewed opportunity to strike a deal with TikTok. While Microsoft owns LinkedIn, a social network geared to professionals, it doesn’t have an app like TikTok in its portfolio.\nMicrosoft had been one of the handful of contenders to buy TikTok in 2020 when President Donald Trump first pushed for a sale. The negotiations had also involved Walmart, which said at the time it was partnering with Microsoft on a possible deal.\nBoth companies dropped their efforts after TikTok agreed to work with Oracle on Project Texas, the initiative by TikTok to store US user data on Oracle-owned servers and that was intended to satisfy US national security concerns.\nFour years later, with TikTok’s future in doubt, so is the fate of Project Texas, and that means those who had previously expressed interest in TikTok may have another shot. And Oracle, too.\nIn a move that caught many by surprise, former Trump Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced last month that he is putting together a team of investors to buy TikTok.\nThe exact details of Mnuchin’s offer are hazy, though he has reportedly suggested a deal could exclude TikTok’s powerful content algorithm that has formed the basis of its popularity. That might get around Chinese government export restrictions on recommendation algorithms, but would essentially mean buying only TikTok’s brand and leaving its most treasured asset off the table.\nThe unusual pitch has already raised eyebrows: Mnuchin helped lead the Trump administration’s effort to ban TikTok the first time around. Mnuchin has said publicly that that experience gave him a deep understanding of TikTok and how it operates, including the data it collects on users.\nThat Mnuchin may now leverage that inside knowledge for his own potential benefit reflects a conflict of interest, some critics say.\nRelated article\nBanning TikTok would hit China’s tech ambitions and deepen the global digital divide\nIt would be a “disgrace if [Mnuchin] was allowed to turn around and use that classified information to further enrich himself and his Saudi buddies,” Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden told The Washington Post last month.\nBuying TikTok would also turn Mnuchin into a rival to Trump, who is the chairman and leading shareholder of the company that owns Truth Social, a social media platform where Trump is its most popular user.\nOther businessmen who’ve expressed interest include Kevin O’Leary, the Canadian chairman of the private venture capital firm O’Leary Ventures. As with Mnuchin, O’Leary has said a potential acquisition of TikTok may have to exclude TikTok’s algorithm. His suggested opening bid? Between $20 billion and $30 billion.\n",

Here’s what happens next\nTikTok said it was “voluntarily” suspending the rewards program after the European Commission announced Monday it could impose fines and a mandatory suspension over concerns that the feature may drive addiction by encouraging users to interact with the platform more.\n“TikTok always seeks to engage constructively with the EU Commission and other regulators,” TikTok said in a post on X. “We are therefore voluntarily suspending the rewards functions in TikTok Lite while we address the concerns that they have raised.”\nThe EU warnings to TikTok reflected an exercise of new oversight powers granted by the Digital Services Act, the trading bloc’s recently enacted law governing online platforms. In opening a probe into TikTok Lite earlier this week, the European Commission said that TikTok could be fined for failing to provide information it owes to the Commission about the app, including a risk assessment report and a separate report outlining steps the company has taken to minimize those risks.\nFailure to hand over the risk assessment and risk mitigation report could result in fines of up to 1% of TikTok’s global annual revenue and “periodic penalties” of up to 5% of TikTok’s average daily revenue, the Commission said previously. TikTok also faces further, additional fines of up to 6% of its global annual revenue if the TikTok Lite feature is determined to be in violation of the DSA.\nTikTok’s move to suspend TikTok Lite’s reward features in Europe, meanwhile, comes as it faces its biggest threat yet to its United States operations. President Joe Biden on Wednesday signed a bill that could lead to a nationwide TikTok ban, after Congress passed the bill earlier this week as part of a wide-ranging foreign aid package meant to support Israel and Ukraine. Under what is now US law, TikTok is forced to find a new owner within months or be banned from the United States entirely.\n",

CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy.\nIn a country best known for its soaring skyscrapers, modern architecture and sprawling desert, wildlife isn’t always what comes to mind when people think of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). But Dubai-based photographer Anish Karingattil is determined to change that.\nOriginally from India, Karingattil moved to Dubai 17 years ago and began photographing wildlife shortly after, specializing in macro photography, using extreme close ups. Highlights of his stunning portfolio of images, taken across the seven Emirates, include a scorpion with her babies, an Arabian horned viper hiding in the desert sand, and two black and yellow mud daubers covered in dew drops.\n“Photographers get to tell a story through images,” Karingattil says. “Macro photography allows me to see life and the world around me in a brand-new way.”\nDespite its hot climate and harsh desert, the UAE is home to over 1,000 plant and animal species. The waters around the country are home to the largest concentration of Indian Ocean humpbacks dolphin in the world, and the second-largest population of dugongs, after Australia.\nWith the UAE’s president recently extending the country’s “Year of Sustainability” into 2024, Karingattil uses wildlife photography as a method of capturing the country’s biodiversity and sharing it with others.\nWhile interior design is his full-time job, “herping” is his passion. “Herping is the act of observing, studying, and photographing reptiles and amphibians in their natural habitats,” says Karingattil. “It is a popular hobby among nature enthusiasts and wildlife photographers who are fascinated by the diversity and beauty of these creatures.”\nBut photographing potentially dangerous animals like snakes and spiders takes a lot of preparation. Before attempting to photograph any wildlife, Karingattil says it is important to research its behavior, habitat and potential risks to understand how to approach it safely and minimize the risk of harm to both the photographer and the animal.\nFor Karingattil, conservation is an important aspect of wildlife photography, which he believes can serve as a powerful tool for advocacy.\n“By documenting the beauty and fragility of the natural world, photographers can help policymakers and the general public understand the value of protecting the environment and the need for sustainable practices,” he says. And with over 69,000 followers on Instagram, Karingattil uses social media to educate people about the species he photographs.\nThe UAE has 49 terrestrial and marine protected areas, including eight in Dubai. Accounting for over 18% of the country’s land territory and 12% of its marine and coastal territory, these protected areas are often natural reserves which include all the major ecosystems found in the region: mountain, desert, coastal and marine.\nAndrew Gardner, associate director of Biodiversity Conservation at Emirates Nature-WWF, says wildlife conservation is recognized as an “important responsibility and obligation by the UAE.” For example, the country is a signatory to multiple international conservation conventions, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity, and has helped reintroduce animals such as the Arabian oryx to the Arabian Peninsula. According to Gardner, there are now over 1,600 oryx in two of the UAE’s protected areas, and thousands more in zoos across the region.\nHowever, rapid development and population growth across the Emirates mean that “53% of bird species, 46.7% of mammal species, 19% of reptile species, and 8% of plant species” are endangered, according to a government report.\nGardner says the Arabian wolf and striped hyena have both gone extinct from the UAE in recent decades, and a small population of Arabian leopards that lived the Hajar Mountains until the mid-1990s are now also believed to be extinct.\nKaringattil points to habitat loss, climate change and overfishing as some of the major threats facing wildlife in the UAE, but one issue he thinks people should take more action against is plastic pollution.\n“Whenever I explore the desert or other areas, I make it a point to clean up the surroundings,” he says. “By removing litter and debris, we can reduce the impact of human activities on the natural world.”\n",

CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy.\nDubai is set to add another towering figure to its skyline.\nThe Aeternitas Tower, officially unveiled at a launch event last week, will be the world’s tallest residential clock tower at a staggering 450 meters (1,476 feet) tall — more than four times the height of London’s Big Ben, and just 22 meters (72 feet) short of the world’s tallest residential building, the Central Park Tower in New York City.\nSet to become the world’s second-tallest clock tower (after the Makkah Clock Royal Tower in Mecca, Saudi Arabia), Aeternitas Tower is the result of a partnership between Dubai-based real estate developer London Gate and Swiss luxury watch manufacturer Franck Muller.\nLondon Gate purchased the plot of land in Dubai Marina, which already had the beginnings of an unfinished 106-story structure — and knew that the tower’s monumental size needed a striking facade, said Tom Hill, media relations coordinator for the developer.\n“We believe the clock will be seen from six kilometers away because of the sheer height of the building,” said Hill, adding that the clock face will be an enormous 40 meters (131 feet) tall and 30 meters (98 feet) wide.\n“We wanted to do something different that hasn’t been done before in Dubai,” said Hill.\nThe residential tower comprises 649 units, with a mix of one- to three-bedroom apartments, in addition to villa and mansion duplexes.\nWith housekeeping, a concierge service, and a 24-hour valet and porter, residents will have access to hotel-like services and facilities, but with the privacy and comfort of home.\nIts shared amenities range from health facilities, including a gym, padel court, spa, yoga studio, and swimming pool, to arts and culture spaces such as a cinema, music room, and library.\nYet-to-be-built Dubai penthouse sells for record $136 million\nThe project will be handed over to residents in 2027, according to London Gate.\nThe tower’s name means “eternity” in Latin, and is inspired by the Franck Muller Aeternitas watch collection — one of the brand’s most complex designs which features an “eternal calendar,” said Erol Baliyan, managing director of Franck Muller in the Middle East and Africa.\nThe Swiss watchmaker sees its step into real estate as a move that will help create a monument that “mirrors the brand’s innovation, craftsmanship, and timeless elegance,” said Baliyan.\nAside from the striking clock face (inspired by Franck Muller’s art deco-style Long Island Collection, which has irregular squashed and stretched numbers in a rectangular case), the watchmaker will infuse its design ethos throughout the residence, said Baliyan.\nHe highlights luxury materials like brushed and polished metals, that will be contrasted with marble surfaces, textured fabrics and bold colors. Meanwhile, in the lobby and reception, the signature oblong face of the brand’s Curvex watch is represented with curved walls, archways, and oval furnishings.\n“Attention to detail is paramount, with meticulously crafted joinery and carefully arranged lighting and furniture, ensuring a refined ambiance,” said Baliyan.\nThe Aeternitas Tower is part of a growing trend in Dubai. Luxury property is booming in the Emirate, and branded residences — collaborations between designer brands and property developers — are surging in popularity.\nAs of October 2023, there were 51 completed projects in the city, a figure that is expected to double by 2030, according to Savills Research, with brands like fashion house Karl Lagerfeld, car manufacturer Mercedes-Benz, and hoteliers 25Hours all announcing residential projects in the past year.\nThis photographer is creating surreal, dramatic images of Dubai’s stunning skyline\nLondon Gate began phase one of its sales last week, with one-bedroom apartments starting at AED 1.6 million ($435,600).\n“We’ve had an unbelievable level of interest since the launch,” said Hill, adding that in the first two days, London Gate sold around 30% of the initial 30-floor release, including all the available one-bedroom apartments.\nHill believes that one factor driving interest is the tower’s location in Dubai Marina, where there’s a scarcity of sites for development, adding that an “iconic tower” like the Aeternitas is the first project of its kind to break ground in the district past few years.\nWhile this is London Gate’s first branded residence project, it won’t be its last, said Hill, adding that the company will announce its next branded partnership by the end of Q1 this year.\nAs a rapidly evolving market, property in Dubai is often sold off-plan, with buyers waiting years to see their purchase. This is where branded residences provide an extra layer of security, particularly for overseas buyers, said Hill.\n“When you have a brand as world-renowned as Franck Muller, for example […] you have that peace of mind that you’re going to be handed over a world-class product,” he added.\n",

She has designed one of the largest malls in Lagos, Nigeria, beach houses on the city’s coast and homes for internally displaced people in the north of the country. She also runs a bespoke furniture design company, and the Nigerian is the first African woman to curate the Sharjah Architecture Triennial, happening in the United Arab Emirates from November 2023 to March 2024.\nIn late 2022, she and her design practice, cmDesign Atelier (cmDA), also completed their first residential project in the ultra-exclusive Banana Island neighborhood in Lagos: “The Lantern House.”\nOshinowo says the Lantern House project, a five-bedroom, seven-bathroom, three-story sustainable home, powered entirely by solar energy, was both exciting and a “slow labor of love.”\nContacted by her clients in September 2020, she, alongside her team and specialist contractors for various aspects of the home, started construction in January 2021 and ended last October.\nThe 1.6 million-square meter (17 million-square feet), man-made Banana Island is named for its shape, and is a private, gated community in Nigeria’s commercial capital. (The exclusive area also made news in April, when a seven-story building under construction collapsed – adding to the list of building collapses in the greater Lagos State.)\nWith private power and water infrastructure systems, property on the island is some of the most expensive on the continent. That exclusivity was one of the main challenges for the Lantern House project, says Oshinowo, with strictly enforced restricted working hours that made looming deadlines difficult to meet.\nDespite this, Oshinowo says seeing her vision come to life was fulfilling, adding that she’s proud of the end result. “It’s one thing to produce great conceptual design. It’s another thing to execute it to a seamless finish,” she said. “It’s such an exciting feeling to think that the decisions that you’ve made have worked.”\nShe says something the Lantern House project emphasized for her is that “being meticulous in the long run always pays off.” cmDA has since started working on another project on Banana Island.\nThe story behind this surreal portrait of Ethiopian identity\nOshinowo remembers wanting to be an architect from the age of 12, looking over floor plans and helping her father to design part of their holiday home when she was young. With degrees in architecture and urban design from the UK as well as an MBA in architecture, she worked for architecture firms in the UK and Europe before moving back to Nigeria in 2009.\nThe award-winning architect says she founded cmDA in 2012 out of a need to create a strong aesthetic language; one that also projected a contemporary and progressive cultural identity of Africa. “(It’s) very important to create architecture that, as much as possible, can be delivered from what is available in country,” Oshinowo added. “And also in doing that, starting to think about issues to do with sustainability and responsibility towards the environment.”\nPritzker Prize 2022: Francis Kéré becomes first African to win ‘Nobel of architecture’\nThis bent towards sustainability is something the 43-year-old has carried into her curatorial role for this year’s upcoming Sharjah Architecture Triennial. The theme Oshinowo came up with is “The beauty of impermanence and the architecture of adaptability” which, she says, looks at under-celebrated innovations in the global south that deal with conditions of scarcity. She adds that she hopes the triennial will be an engaging space for the international community.\n“It’s a validation to know that coming from Nigeria, practicing as a Black female architect in West Africa, that my work is not just relevant to the context of where we find ourselves now,” Oshinowo said, “in terms of importance relating to sustainability (and) adaptability, but also to equity.”\n",

CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy.\nDubai is making a splash with its most recent record-setting structure.\nThe newly opened twin skyscrapers One Za’abeel are home to the world’s longest cantilever building and on it, the United Arab Emirates’ longest suspended infinity pool, which is 120 meters (393 feet) in length.\nA cantilever is a structure that is only connected at one end, and projects horizontally unsupported, like a diving board. The one at One Za’abeel is part of a 230-meter-long (755-foot) structure known as “The Link,” with the cantilever projecting 67.5 meters (221 feet) over the city.\nThe Link connects the luxury development’s two towers, providing a space for shared facilities and lifestyle amenities, says Fadi Jabri, CEO of Nikken Sekkei Dubai, the architecture firm behind the building.\n“Levitating in the air,” the giant glass corridor is an engineering marvel — but it’s not just for show, says Jabri.\nThe site is bisected by a six-lane highway, which meant building facilities at ground level was not possible, and “there was this need to rejoin those sites,” he explains. The property’s developers negotiated the use of the space below and above the road, allowing them to connect the two towers with a shopping mall beneath the road, and the Link above.\nTwenty-five meters (82 feet) high and wide, the cantilever contains three stories and is a key destination for the building’s hotel guests and residents, says Badr Benryane, director of food and beverage at the One&Only Za’abeel resort, which occupies the top 30 floors of one of the towers.\n“In the absence of a beach and other water-based activities, our guests will have The Link as their playground,” says Benryane.\nRelated article\nWorld’s highest 360-degree infinity pool opens in Dubai\n“It’s been inspired by the bustling streets of big cities around the world: it’s a futuristic boulevard, so as you walk down the middle of The Link, you will have different dining experiences.”\nThe Link’s eight restaurants include Tapasake, a poolside Nikkei restaurant serving up Japanese-Peruvian dishes. “On one end, there’s the restaurant with a terrace and indoor seating, and on the other is the pool club where we have amazing VIP cabanas, loungers and daybeds,” says Benryane.\nHaving taken a dip in the pool himself, Benryane says it’s one of the highlights of the space. “You’re basically in that infinity pool with nothing below you,” he says, adding: “You’re swimming amongst the clouds and overlooking the city — it’s beautiful.”\nTemperature regulated and featuring underwater speakers, the unique bathing spot is open to hotel guests and One Za’abeel residents, although tourists and Dubai residents can gain access with a pool day pass, starting from 1,000 dirhams ($272) per person, and going up to $10,000 for VIP cabanas that come equipped with their own sound system, air conditioning, showers, dining rooms and private garden.\nRelated article\nWorld’s deepest pool opens in Dubai, part of huge underwater city\nDubai is home to several record-setting pools: in 2021, the Aura Skypool became the world’s highest 360-degree infinity pool, and the world’s tallest infinity pool inside a building is the 293.9-meter-high (964.2 feet) pool on the 77th floor of the Address Beach Resort in Dubai’s Jumeirah Gate.\nThe Link’s 100-meter (328 feet) elevation and floor-to-ceiling windows provide 360-degree views across the city to the desert beyond, from which the building gets its name (“Za’abeel means the white sands of the region,” explains Badr).\nThe cantilever isn’t just important for the building’s social space, but also its design: the two towers were built leaning slightly out, so the weight of The Link would pull them both in, strengthening the overall structure, says Jabri.\nWeighing nearly 10,000 tons, it was constructed in eight parts and lifted into place with cranes over three days, which required the road below to be closed on several occasions. The $1 billion project was originally expected to open in late 2021, but was delayed by Covid.\n",

        "content": "There’s one small corner of the world that Michael Jordan cherishes more than any other — his own personal haven of sporting bliss.\nBut it’s not in Chicago. In fact, there isn’t a basketball court or hoop in sight.\nEven as he was staking his claim in the 1990s as the greatest player the NBA has ever seen, the Bulls icon was a regular guest on the golf course. These days, though, he hosts.\nThe Grove XXIII – a nod to his signature No. 23 jersey — is Jordan’s very own golf paradise, a private club tucked away on the outskirts of Hobe Sound, Florida. Ultra-exclusive, few have seen it, and even fewer have played it.\nFor Bobby Weed, it was at once the most straightforward and most difficult brief he had ever received: “Build me the best golf course. Build me the best driving range.”\nAnd there had been plenty of briefs before. A protégé, then close friend, of legendary course designer Pete Dye, the South Carolinian served as the PGA Tour’s chief architect before launching his own course design company in 1994.\nAlmost three decades on, Bobby Weed Golf Design has sculpted more than 20 courses from the ground up – from Stillwater, Minnesota, to Mito, Japan — and renovated many more, including Hobe Sound’s Medalist Golf Club in 2015.\nWith Tiger Woods headlining a member’s list that reads like a who’s who of the game’s elite, the Medalist is a private club that attracts a star-studded cohort of visitors. Among them was Jordan, a keen admirer of the revamp and who, in late 2017, was on the hunt for a course architect.\nA meeting later, Weed’s team was signed on to construct a golf kingdom fit for “His Airness.” As one of history’s most famous athletes, and with a net worth edging towards the $2 billion mark, according to Forbes, Jordan was a special category of client.\n“I knew that it would get a lot of attention because of MJ,” Weed, 68, told CNN.\n“I knew that there was some fanfare associated with it and I didn’t want to let him down.”\nThe land was secured soon after, some 200-plus acres of former citrus grove, next to Atlantic Ridge State Park. As he often does for projects, Weed lived on site, making the 265-mile switch across the state from Ponte Vedra Beach.\nWeed was all-in, and encouraged Jordan to be as engaged as he wanted to be in developments, inviting him to come out once weekly to track the progress. Jordan often visited multiple times a week.\nWeed likens his role as course architect to that of a quarterback: calling plays for a large roster of consultants. Watching Jordan in discussion with the team during one early meeting, he got the impression of a coach interacting with his players.\n“I think one of his qualities is he was such a good listener, and he absorbed everything that you were discussing,” Weed said.\n“He didn’t come out and say ‘do this or do that.’ He came out and observed and was a great listener, and he let me do my job.”\nWeed had his two pillars for a great golf course — an engaged owner and a good piece of property, though the latter would require some polishing.\nFor nearly 50 years, only Black men caddied The Masters. One day, they all but vanished\nTurning a flat, “featureless” site – bordered by two long drainage canals – into a cross between the manicured, parkland style of Augusta National and the rustic layout of Pine Valley represented the greatest challenge to him and his team.\nDirt was excavated from lagoons to build the course and its features, fixing the flatness issue and leaving behind six large lakes – the same number of NBA Championships Jordan won. It was a coincidence, but ultimately fit the theme of a course tuned to the finest degree to its owner’s style.\nJordan wanted firm and fast, a course that could both excite and challenge its members, many of whom would be among the PGA Tour’s current stars. A double-helix layout, with a “crossover” at the 5th and 14th holes, offers the flexibility to play continual internal circuits in three, six, or nine-hole loops – ideal for Jordan’s busy schedule.\nThe course didn’t just need to suit the playstyle of its owner, though, it needed to enhance it.\n“You don’t think I’m going to spend this much money and not have a little bit of an advantage do you?” Weed recalled Jordan saying.\nAdd to that the five-time MVP’s penchant for wagers, which will be familiar to viewers of docuseries “The Last Dance,” and the course has earned a new name among some members: “Slaughterhouse 23.”\n“It’s his golf course, so it’s set up very well for him,” former world No. 1 Rickie Fowler told the Subpar podcast in 2020.\nWeed, too, got drawn into the wagers, even during construction.\n“I can remember us being out there hitting shots and doing a little gambling while we were just playing in the dirt. It was just great fun and interaction,” he said.\n“It’s hard not to go out there and play a round with MJ without having a friendly wager.”\nTo meet the second requirement of Jordan’s brief, Weed’s team set aside 20 acres to construct a state-of-the-art practice facility that the designer believes has no equal.\nTwo 400-yard, double-sided driving lanes can be maintained for specific conditions, such as US Open or PGA Tour style fairways, with “target greens” in 25-yard increments. Each green has built-in pods that can track swathes of shot information, incorporating the PGA Tour’s ShotLink data.\nThe putting green is split into four quadrants, with incremental slopes ranging from 0-1% to 3-4% inclines. Even the grass on the tees is customizable, with different types to mimic warm or cool seasons.\n“It’s a Tour player’s haven to work on their game,” said Weed.\nCompared to Bobby Weed Golf Design, Nichols Architects had considerably less experience in golf courses, but it did have one key advantage in its efforts to beat other bids to build The Grove XXIII’s clubhouse.\nSpecializing in hospitality, residential, and commercial design, the firm had worked on the W South Beach in Miami — the favorite hotel of Jordan’s wife Yvette Prieto.\nThe team pulled no punches with its pitch to Jordan. “You’re not going to confuse this clubhouse with a clubhouse down the road or anything like that, and that’s what we’re selling you,” planning and design partner Igor Reyes told CNN of the pitching process, likening it to that depicted in the “Air” movie, where Nike must lure a rookie Jordan away from a deal with Adidas.\n“You’ve really got to make an architectural iconic shape, and a shape that you could almost immediately feel was swinging across the landscape. Hopefully you can almost read the concept without anybody having to tell you,” Reyes said.\nThe deal clincher — outlined to Jordan in a pitch video — was that clubhouse shape, inspired by the smooth, “almost machine-like” perfection of a golf swing.\nReyes said his team had heard of Jordan’s purported early struggles with his swing, and, in the video, set up a column grid to map the building’s structure onto Tiger Woods’ club trajectory. Jordan was captivated, and told the firm there and then that it would get the contract.\n“The first time you walk into the room with him, you don’t want to get too close or anything like that, it was kind of an odd thing,” Reyes said. “But by the second or third meeting we were just talking to him like a ‘regular’ client with a huge amount of respect.\n“There was a really a sense of, ‘This isn’t just a guy with a lot of money that wants to do something. This guy knows what he’s doing, he knows what he likes, and how to get to it.’”\nInside, 15,000 square feet of space leaves ample room for men’s and women’s lockers, indoor and outdoor lounge areas, kitchen and dining facilities, and even a shop.

Micro is the term used for taking photos of tiny subjects that require magnification, while macro involves capturing close-up images of larger subjects.\nTracy Calder, co-founder of the competition and jury member, told CNN how the photos reveal unusual interactions between animals and plants, demonstrating how everything in the natural world is interconnected and interdependent. It “celebrates animals and behavior that people have never seen or encountered before,” she said.\nExtraordinary photos reveal the secret kingdom of the soil\nThis year’s grand prize went to Hungarian photographer Csaba Daróczi, for his black and white image of a Eurasian nuthatch soaring through a forest. Taken with a GoPro from inside a hollowed-out tree stump, the striking image offers a new perspective of the bird against the backdrop of outstretched trees.\nThe title of young close-up photographer of the year went to 17-year-old Spaniard Carlos Pérez Naval for his image of a Moorish gecko on a wall covered with pyrolusite crystals. “These magnesium minerals create stunning formations, which look just like petrified trees, but they are so small that they’re tricky to spot,” he said in a press release.\n“I wanted to capture a gecko in the ‘petrified forest’ for a long time, but they only recently appeared in my village – probably carried in fruit baskets from hotter areas. Due to climate change they can now survive here,” he added.\nThe jury – made up of 23 photographers, scientists and naturalists – chose the winning photos for each category from a total of 12,000 entries from 67 countries. Many were taken in areas local to the photographers, showing the beauty of what can be seen in your own backyard, said Calder.\nClose-up images show insects as you’ve never seen them before\nShe, along with her husband Daniel, founded the competition in 2018. Both are professional photographers. While many other photo awards feature close-up categories, they believed there was a need for an entire competition dedicated to macro and micro photography.\n“It’s often easier for people to get behind conservation stories featuring ‘cute’ or more obvious animals and plants: rhinos, pandas, orchids. But the lesser-known insects and plants we often consider weeds have a huge role to play in keeping everything balanced. Close-up photography often showcases these animals and plants,” she said.\n“There’s also a joy in showing people things they wouldn’t be able to see without a macro lens or microscope. Many of the creatures and plants we show are all around us but are never noticed. The competition is a way for them to be noticed,” she added.\n",

        "content": "A portrait by Gustav Klimt that was unseen for almost a century has sold for $32 million – the bottom end of its pre-auction estimate.\nThe “Portrait of Fräulein Lieser,” thought to be one of the Austrian painter’s final works, created huge excitement in the art world, but it ended up selling at the lower end of its valuation of €30 million-€50 million ($32 million to $53.4 million).\nBids started at €28 million and the work went for a hammer price of €30 million. This does not include the auction house’s fees.\nThe sale price was less than half that fetched by another Klimt painting – “Dame mit Fächer” (Lady with a Fan) – in London last year. The last portrait completed by Klimt became the most expensive artwork ever to sell at a European auction, when it sold for a £85.3 million ($108.4 million).\nRelated article\nKlimt portrait missing for nearly a century could sell for $54 million\nThe “Portrait of Fräulein Lieser” had long been considered lost, according to Vienna auction house im Kinsky. However, it recently emerged that it had been privately owned by an Austrian citizen.\n“The rediscovery of this portrait, one of the most beautiful of Klimt’s last creative period, is a sensation,” the auction house said in a press statement on its website prior to its sale on Wednesday afternoon.\nThe intensely vivid and colorful piece had been documented in catalogues of the artist’s work, but experts had only seen it in a black and white photo.\nThe sitter is known to have been a member of a wealthy Austrian Jewish family who were then part of the upper class of Viennese society, where Klimt found his patrons and clients. Nevertheless, her identity is not completely certain.\nBrothers Adolf and Justus Lieser were leading industrialists in the Austro-Hungarian empire. Catalogues of Klimt’s work state that Adolf commissioned the artist to paint his teenage daughter Margarethe Constance. However, new research by the auction house suggests Justus’ wife, Lilly, hired him to paint one of their two daughters.\nThe statement on the auctioneer’s website reveals that the sitter – whoever she was – visited Klimt’s studio nine times in April and May 1917. He made at least 25 preliminary studies and most likely began the painting in the May of that year.\n“The painter chose a three-quarter portrait for his depiction and shows the young woman in a strictly frontal pose, close to the foreground, against a red, undefined background. A cape richly decorated with flowers is draped around her shoulders,” the auction house said.\nIt added: “The intense colors of the painting and the shift towards loose, open brushstrokes show Klimt at the height of his late period.”\nWhen the artist died of a stroke the following February, the painting was still in his studio — with some small parts not quite finished. It was then given to the Lieser family.\nIts exact fate after 1925 is “unclear,” according to the auction house.\n“What is known is that it was acquired by a legal predecessor of the consignor in the 1960s and went to the current owner through three successive inheritances,” the statement said.\nThe painting was to be sold on behalf of its Austrian owners, who have not been named, along with the legal successors of “Adolf and Henriette Lieser based on an agreement in accordance with the Washington Principles of 1998,” the auction house said.\nEstablished in 1998, the Washington Principles charged participating nations with returning Nazi-confiscated art to their rightful owners.\nRelated article\nRussian billionaire loses Sotheby’s art fraud lawsuit involving ‘Salvator Mundi’\nClaudia Mörth-Gasser, specialist in modern art at im Kinsky, explained the situation in an email to CNN.\nShe said the auctioneer checked the painting’s history and provenance “in all possible ways in Austria,” adding: “We have checked all archives and have found no evidence that the painting has ever been exported out of Austria, confiscated or looted.”\nBut by the same token, she added: “We have no proof that the painting has not ever been looted in the time gap between 1938 and 1945.”\nAnd this is the reason “why we arranged an agreement between the present owner and all descendants of the Lieser family in accordance to the ‘Washington Principles,’” she said.\nKlimt’s portraits of women “are seldom offered at auctions,” the press release stated. It continued: “A painting of such rarity, artistic significance, and value has not been available on the art market in Central Europe for decades.”\n",

A regional prosecutor based in the provincial capital Ouahigouya first flagged the killings in a statement on March 1.\nThe spokesperson for the Burkina Faso government did not respond to phone calls seeking comment on the HRW report. The ministry of defense did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Facebook and via email. A telephone number for the ministry listed on its website did not exist.\nThe attacks on the villages of Komsilga, Nodin and Soro were attributed to unidentified assailants, the prosecutor said in the statement, adding that an investigation had been launched.\nAs with previous cases of extrajudicial killings in the country, no official findings have been released.\nRights groups have previously accused the military in junta-ruled Burkina Faso of attacking and killing civilians suspected of collaborating with militants in retaliatory operations.\nThe executions coincided with a Feb. 25 report on Burkina Faso national television about a major attack on military targets in Yatenga, one of several areas affected by violent Islamist groups active in the north of Burkina and other Sahel nations.\nAuthorities have previously denied reports of soldiers killing civilians.\nHuman Rights Watch interviewed 23 people by telephone between Feb. 28 and March 31, including witnesses to the killings, local civil society activists and international organizations. It also verified footage shared by survivors.\nRelated article\nAround 170 ‘executed’ in three Burkina Faso villages, public prosecutor says\nWitnesses said more than 100 soldiers went to the village of Nodin and then to the nearby village of Soro on Feb. 25, where they killed residents in retaliation for a jihadist attack on a military camp about 25 km (15 miles) away.\nThe soldiers went door-to-door, ordering people out of their homes and rounding them up before opening fire, HRW said in its report, citing witnesses.\nSurvivors and people who helped bury the bodies compiled two lists with a total 223 victims from Nodin and Soro. Most were buried in mass graves.\n“The Burkinabe army has repeatedly committed mass atrocities against civilians in the name of fighting terrorism with almost no one held to account,” HRW executive director Tirana Hassan said in the report.\nThe watchdog has called on authorities to investigate the massacres and to do so with support from the African Union and the United Nations for independence and impartiality.\nBurkina Faso is one of several Sahel nations that have been struggling to contain Islamist insurgencies linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State that have spread from neighboring Mali since 2012, killing thousands and displacing millions.\nFrustrations over authorities’ failure to protect civilians have contributed to two coups in Mali, two in Burkina Faso and one in Niger since 2020.\nRights groups have also accused Mali’s army of using retaliatory tactics on civilians, which it denies.\n",

Read more opinion at CNN.\nThe $95 billion military aid package President Joe Biden signed Wednesday was a feat of tough-minded negotiation to get funding to Ukraine and Israel after months of congressional horse-trading. But if the aid inflates those countries’ war aims, it could discourage the kind of tough-minded negotiation that is the only way to end their wars.\nBiden is right to help democratic countries confront their illiberal enemies. Israel and Ukraine suffered terrible crimes of aggression. But lofty expressions of unconditional support can paradoxically hurt the countries they are meant to help by hindering the kind of negotiated peace that saves civilian lives and restores stability.\nThe funds might motivate Ukraine and Israel to pursue unwinnable victories: the full restoration of Ukraine’s borders and reclamation of Crimea, and the destruction of Hamas, respectively. In international politics and armed conflict, fraught as they are with mutual distrust and competing views of fairness, sometimes countries can’t achieve justice — they can only achieve peace.\nThe new infusion of aid gives the US a lot of leverage with Ukraine and Israel. Washington has largely refused to exercise its leverage thus far, but it must do so now or peace in the near future doesn’t stand a chance.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to maintain that “total victory” over Hamas is the only outcome he will accept. But as the war grinds on, Israel reports having killed fewer than half of Hamas’ fighters while its tunnel network hasn’t been completely dismantled, indicating the group can likely sustain an insurgency against Israel for the foreseeable future. And even if it were possible to destroy Hamas, that outcome could prove to be a catastrophic success when images of the accompanying civilian devastation fuel ever more radicalization among Palestinians and stirs angry Arab publics who pressure their leaders to scuttle Arab-Israeli normalization efforts.\nSimilarly, the Ukrainian government insists it will continue fighting until it regains all of the territory it has lost, including Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014, and there is no sign the US administration is pushing it to reconsider. But as Gen. Mark Milley, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told me a year ago, “neither side is likely to achieve their complete political objectives through military means” so “it will probably end somewhere, somehow at a negotiating table.” And that was before Ukraine lost some of its best troops and equipment in last summer’s highly anticipated offensive, which failed to strike a knockout blow to Russia.\nRelated article\nOpinion: What John Fetterman and Mike Johnson have in common\nTo its credit, the administration seems clear-eyed enough to privately acknowledge Ukraine’s chances for retaking additional territory are slim. But there is still no public indication the US is trying to lay the groundwork for a negotiated settlement. Signaling American resolve can preserve Ukraine’s bargaining position, but it risks convincing Ukraine to reject a reasonable peace deal — if one is eventually offered — and continue fighting in pursuit of morally righteous but unattainable goals.\nLikewise, while the administration has ramped up humanitarian aid to Gaza, encouraged negotiations to get Hamas to release Israeli hostages and called for the Palestinian Authority to administer Gaza, it could do more to convince Israel to fundamentally rethink its destabilizing goals. The Biden administration should publicly and privately convey to Israel’s leaders that their current strategy is unlikely to succeed and undermines regional security.\nThere will be at least a few objections to orienting American policy toward the best possible outcomes in these conflicts — achieving peace and stability in the near term — rather than the unrealistic goals of our partners.\nWar has a way of eliciting worldviews organized around simplistic binaries. After the terror attacks on September 11, 2001, then-President George W. Bush declared that every country had to decide: “Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.” When Biden spoke of the war in Ukraine, Americans were told we faced a choice between offering Kyiv unconditional support or “withdrawing” from the conflict and letting Putin “erase” Ukraine. But these kinds of Manichean views that divide the world into evil aggressors and righteous victims do not make impossible military victories any more achievable.\nRelated article\nOpinion: Congress must let Ukraine win, say Barbra Streisand, Sean Penn, Imagine Dragons, Timothy Snyder and other luminaries\nSome people will say that the US can’t simply tell Ukraine and Israel, both sovereign countries, what to do. Indeed, this has largely been Biden’s public position, evident in his mantra “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine” and in the State Department’s insistence that “the United States doesn’t dictate to Israel what it must do.”\nThese countries do have agency — but so does the United States. American involvement in assisting these nations’ war efforts gives it the right and responsibility to share the course of each conflict in ways that protect its interests. The US can respect Ukraine’s and Israel’s agency without subjugating its own.\nIn Ukraine, this doesn’t mean threatening the withdrawal of aid, which would weaken its battlefield and negotiating position. Instead, the US could have enforced the restrictions it had already made (on Abrams Tanks, F-16s, cluster munitions and long-range missiles) or it could now materially support diplomatic efforts as enthusiastically as military efforts. However, the recent aid package includes long-range missiles, or ATACMS, which suggests Ukraine is readying an offensive against Crimea. For a year and a half, Biden judiciously refused to send these to Ukraine, calling them a “red line” for Putin, who might use nuclear weapons were Crimea attacked.\nIn Israel, putting conditions on military aid is a better idea. The US did use leverage after an Israeli military strike killed aid workers from World Central Kitchen — with sources telling CNN that Biden warned Netanyahu that the US would reconsider how it’s supporting Israel’s war unless Israel allowed for more humanitarian aid in Gaza. After that, Israel acceded to the ultimatum and, per a reported demand by Biden, publicly announced the change that day. Unfortunately, there’s little evidence the president has kept up the pressure. When the aid package passed Congress, a pro-Israel lobbying group cheered that the security assistance came “with no added conditions.”\nOne historical example illustrates how the US might use its leverage with Netanyahu today. After Israel encircled the Egyptian military in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger flew to Tel Aviv and pressured Prime Minister Golda Meir to enact a ceasefire. Egypt’s attack was, like that of Hamas, an unprovoked and surprise act of aggression. Kissinger feared a victory by the Soviet-backed Arab states. But recently declassified documents show he also feared an all-out Israeli victory.\nSign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook\nKissinger wrote that “from an Israeli point of view, it is no disaster to have the whole Arab world radicalized and anti-American, because this guarantees our continued support. From an American point of view, it is a disaster.” Kissinger advised that the US needed “to be taken even more seriously” by Israel, and “our insistence on a more politically oriented policy cannot go unheeded.” This advice rings even truer today.\nFundamentally, negotiated settlements are often morally unsatisfying. Russia shouldn’t be allowed to invade a sovereign country and get away with it. Israel has the right to defend itself. But too narrow a focus on what’s morally just obscures an appreciation for what’s strategically possible. What’s possible, in both Ukraine and Gaza, is peace.\n",

Then just 17 years old, she lists her date of birth as July 1, 1960, exactly a year before she was actually born.\nAccording to a press release sent to CNN by English auction house Auctioneum, Solve Your Problem Ltd. was a recruitment firm set up by Mary Cook, a one-time Portuguese countess who had settled in London after divorcing her husband.\nThe firm was “a high-class establishment, vetting staff for royal residences and for homes of the rich and famous based in London,” according to the auctioneer. Cook kept the contract as a souvenir and it was eventually passed to the company’s current owners, who are now offering it for sale.\n• Sign up to CNN’s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on the royal family, what they are up to in public and what’s happening behind palace walls.\nOf Diana’s altered date of birth, auctioneer Andrew Stowe said in the press release: “Our client had always been told that this was done deliberately, in order that Diana would appear older and therefore more likely to secure a job with the agency, or at least a higher rate of pay! It could, of course, just be a simple oversight!”\nThe young woman listed her religion on the contract as “Protestant” and said that she couldn’t drive. She did not say what kind of work she was looking for or how much she expected to get paid, but that she was seeking employment “as soon as possible.”\nDiana, who died in a car crash in Paris in 1997, had moved to London not long before signing the contract, according to Auctioneum. It shows her address as Cadogan Place SW1 – a few months later she would move to her own flat at Coleherne Court in Kensington.\nThe document, which is expected to sell for up to $10,000, is thought to be the late princess’ first official work contract. She had done some informal childcare work for friends and family previously – two of whom are listed as referees on the document.\n“This is an incredibly important piece of history,” said Stowe. “Getting your first job is a big moment in anyone’s life, let alone when that person becomes one of the most famous figures of the twentieth century. Here we have a teenage Diana Spencer, freshly moved to London, trying to find her way in life and applying for her first job. It’s so human, so real, so normal.”\nRelated article\nThis very ’80s evening gown worn by Princess Diana just set an auction record\nThe contract is annotated in blue by the employer, who describes some of the applicant’s skills as “cook – basic … housework … animals … ballet dancer.” Other comments include “check skirt” and “lovely girl – send anywhere.”\nStowe described the document as “poignant,” adding: “At face value, this is just an everyday document, a piece of office stationery that lived in a filing cabinet alongside hundreds of others. Yet just over two years later, Diana Spencer would become Princess Of Wales and her life would never be the same. This contract is one of the last remaining snapshots of Diana’s life before she was thrust into the spotlight.\n“It’s filled with hope, it’s filled with nerves, it represents the emotions and feelings of every teenager trying to find their first job – and yet, there is of course, a great feeling of sadness attached.”\nThe item is being sold as part of Auctioneum’s Autographs & Memorabilia Online Auction, which ends on Tuesday.\n",

It will be loaded onto a lander made by US company Intuitive Machines, and once deployed it will connect the lander via radio equipment to two roaming vehicles with their own special mission: to search for ice.\nOne of the vehicles, the Lunar Outpost rover, will explore the area known as Shackleton Connecting Ridge, while the other, the Micro-Nova hopper, will plunge into a crater to scan for unprecedented up-close evidence of Moon ice.\nImages of ice — transmitted back to the lander and then Earth in near real-time via the cellular network — would be a world-first. Lunar ice could be used to create breathable oxygen, and even fuel that could eventually be used to launch Mars missions from the Moon.\nFor NASA’s Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon this decade, cellular connectivity is invaluable.\nCurrently, astronauts talk to each other by radio, but NASA wants a lunar communications system capable of supporting high-resolution video and science data, said Engelund — especially as Artemis missions become more sophisticated.\n“Being able to communicate on the Moon is critical to Artemis — as critical as any other mission element like power, water to drink, and air to breathe,” said Engelund.\n“Eventually, this effort will help establish a lunar communications network that could give our explorers the ability to beam scientific data back, confer with mission control, and talk to their families, as if they were walking down the street on their cellphones.”\nIt could lay the groundwork for an off-world internet not dissimilar to that of Earth’s. Personal devices could connect to such networks, allowing ﻿space colonists to use smartphones that can access all the apps and services available to those back on Earth.\nNASA selected Bell Labs as part of its Tipping Point initiative, a series of partnerships with companies to develop technologies for future missions that puts them in prime position for key roles in the future space economy.\nBell Labs was given a $14.1 million grant in 2020, and in January, Nokia was selected by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to begin working on a communications services infrastructure that will eventually serve as the “framework for the lunar economy.”\n“A future lunar economy will critically depend on communication technologies to collect and analyze data, share information, and maintain and control operations,” Thierry Klein, president of Bell Labs Solutions Research, told CNN.\n“This includes sustaining a semi-permanent or permanent human presence on the Moon, as well as automated robotic operations for transportation, resource mining, mineral processing and scientific data collection.”\nThere are potential commercial benefits for Earthly business ventures too.\nIf a network can withstand the journey into orbit, then deploy and endure autonomously amid the vacuum of space, wildly fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation, it will be able to survive the harshest locations on Earth — such as polar ice caps, deserts, or offshore platforms.\n“Especially when it comes to remote deployments, industrial sites, public safety, emergency response, disaster recovery or defense, it is highly beneficial to have compact, low-footprint network equipment that can be easily transported and deployed anywhere,” Klein said.\n",

        "content": "When President Joe Biden visited Virginia to commemorate Earth Day on Monday, he was joined by Sen. Bernie Sanders, a key architect of the clean energy proposals that Biden was rolling out. But those weren’t the only items on the Vermont independent’s mind.\nSanders, according to people familiar with the conversation, used the rare private time with Biden – a longtime Senate colleague who was once his rival in the Democratic presidential primary – to relay concerns about the administration’s handling of the humanitarian situation in Gaza and to urge Biden to use newly authorized funding as leverage over Israel.\n“The main message was: ‘You’re going to have it in your pocket … you need to hold it and condition this funding,” Faiz Shakir, a longtime adviser to Sanders and executive director of More Perfect Union, told CNN. The money “cannot come in and just go right out.”\nThe demands from the progressive flank of the president’s own party come as protests over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza grow in number and intensity, most notably on college campuses, where protesters have decried the stance of “Genocide Joe.” But where the domestic politics of the situation are concerned, the president and his administration remain unbowed.\nThis week’s rapid spread of college campus encampments meant to protest the war has ratcheted up the pressure on the US over its support for Israel. The temperature has been raised on campuses across the country as the protests are met with concern about antisemitic comments that Jewish students have heard at some of the protests and clashes between protesters and police officers sent to break up the encampments.\nColumbia University, the epicenter of the campus protests, has transitioned classes into hybrid mode until the end of the semester as the unrest reaches a fever pitch. Second gentleman Doug Emhoff spoke by phone with two Jewish leaders on campus, a White House official said, to discuss the immediate need to address antisemitism on college campuses.\nDespite being just miles from Columbia and the most tense scenes of the protests, Biden will not be making a visit to campus as he holds events in the New York area Friday. Aides never seriously considered a visit by the president to campus, acknowledging the security situation and political calculus presented challenges too steep.\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, the top Republican helping to shepherd the foreign aid package through the House of Representatives, used his visit on Wednesday in part to demand action from the Biden administration in protecting Jewish students. Johnson, speaking publicly during his visit, said he planned to call Biden following his visit and demand action, including a plan for a potential mobilization of the National Guard.\n“We have to bring order to these campuses. We cannot allow this to happen around the country,” Johnson said. “We are better than this.”\nBiden, for months, has taken the pro-Palestinian demonstrations in stride – including at many of his public events – and advisers say there’s no plan to change course. A lifelong politician, Biden understands there will always be some people who disagree with him, and those people have a right to voice their discontent.\nBut one of those advisers acknowledged the explicit threats targeting Jewish students has been particularly alarming.\n“Protest the war all you want,” the adviser told CNN. “What you don’t have the right to do is target Jewish students.”\nSome senior advisers to the president - closely monitoring the growing unrest – are making the case that the protestors comprise a very small percentage of the student body and do not represent the views of the majority.\nRecent polling conducted by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics would seem to support that view. While just 18% of voters aged 18-29 approved of Biden’s handling of the situation in the Middle East, it ranked near the bottom of issues that mattered most to them – with the economy overwhelmingly top of mind. And the young voters polled sympathize in equal numbers with the Israeli and Palestinian people.\nBut the optics of the situation remain challenging for Biden, who this week signed into law an aid package granting $16 billion in additional military funding for Israel as the protests raged on. While the White House has been dissatisfied with how Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is carrying out the war against Hamas and the volume of humanitarian assistance to Gaza thus far, it remains unclear whether that will materially impact what has so far been unwavering support for Israel from Biden.\nIn February, Biden released a national security memo stating that partners receiving military aid from the US must adhere to international humanitarian law. The White House must by May 8 certify whether Israel is complying. While the administration intends to meet that deadline, officials have not reached a conclusion, CNN has learned.\nDuring a phone call earlier this month, Biden told Netanyahu the US could be forced to make changes to free-flowing support if Israel did not make immediate moves to allow more humanitarian assistance into Gaza, CNN has reported.\nIf the US concludes that Israel is impeding aid and not adhering to human rights laws, the White House could pursue a response that slows military provisions, curtails monetary assistance, or drastically ratchets up the public pressure on Netanyahu by the president. No decisions have been made, officials have said.\nAnd while Sanders sought assurances from Biden on how he was approaching the situation, the president remained characteristically diplomatic, Shakir, the Sanders adviser said.\n“The question for a lot of progressives is, is there any accountability?” he asked.\nCNN’s Sam Fossum contributed to this report.\n",

        "content": "The head of the Federal Student Aid office, which has faced criticism for the botched rollout of this year’s college financial aid form, will be stepping down.\nAccording to a letter to staff obtained by CNN, Richard Cordray said Friday that he will not be continuing in his role for another three-year term. He has served as the chief operating officer of FSA in the Department of Education since May 4, 2021, and will stay on through June to help with the transition.\nThe announcement of Cordray’s departure comes as his office has been under fire for problems with a new version of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, released late last year. Delays and technical glitches have kept millions of students waiting to hear how much college will cost them this fall and have raised concerns that some low-income students won’t enroll at all.\nEarlier this month, Cordray became a focus of a hearing held by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce about the FAFSA rollout.\n“If there was a financial aid director, or even a college president, that delayed financial aid on their campus for up to six months, the professional price that would be paid for that would be pretty steep,” Justin Draeger, president of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, told lawmakers.\nThe committee, led by Republican Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, later posted to X that “It’s time for Richard Cordray to go.”\nIn a statement Friday, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona applauded Cordray’s work to make improvements to the student loan program, administering a record amount of student debt forgiveness and holding schools that defrauded students accountable —but did not mention the FAFSA overhaul.\n“We are grateful for Rich Cordray’s three years of service, in which he accomplished more transformational changes to the student aid system than any of his predecessors,” Cardona said.\n“It’s no exaggeration to say that Rich helped change millions of lives for the better,” he added.\nPreviously, Cordray was the first director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which launched during the Obama administration. Before that, he served as Ohio’s attorney general and was the Democratic nominee for governor of Ohio in 2018.\n“Over my tenure, we provided student loan forgiveness to more than 4,000,000 borrowers and their families; made it easier for people to apply for and manage federal student aid; and took strong actions to hold schools accountable for defrauding students,” Cordray said in a statement sent to CNN.\nThe congressionally mandated overhaul of the FAFSA was authorized through two different pieces of legislation passed in 2019 and 2020. The changes were long overdue and are meant to simplify the form and to make more low-income students eligible for federal student aid such as Pell grants.\nWhile the new version of the form is much shorter, the rollout has been plagued by problems that have created major delays for students planning to go to college this fall.\nFirst, the form wasn’t available until the very end of December — about three months later than usual — and was offline for many hours of the day during the first week of January.\nRelated article\nWhy students are freaking out about the FAFSA this year\nSince then, many families and students have experienced problems and glitches when submitting the form. FAFSA completions among high school seniors are currently down 36% compared with the prior class, according to the National College Attainment Network.\nFurther problems on the back end and a last-minute change to the aid calculation meant that colleges did not receive any FAFSA information until March, even if a student submitted the form back in January. Once colleges received the data from the Department of Education, there were errors with some of the information, and many forms must be reprocessed.\nAs a result, many financial aid applicants are still waiting to hear how much college will cost them next year, even as the typical May 1 college decision deadline approaches.\nThe Biden administration has said that the overhaul of the FAFSA was a huge undertaking — one that not only transformed the form itself, but also the calculations and back-end processing system — and that its requests for more funding from Congress were not met.\nBut Republicans have argued that the Department of Education was too focused on implementing Biden’s student loan forgiveness policies and let the FAFSA work fall to the wayside.\nThe Department of Education has been facing criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle for the delays, and the Government Accountability Office has started an investigation into the new form’s implementation.\nAs the head of FSA, Cordray oversaw not only the FAFSA but also the entire $1.6 trillion federal student loan system.\nDuring Cordray’s tenure, the Department of Education authorized the cancellation of about $153 billion in federal student loan debt for 4 million borrowers. FSA tackled a backlog of debt relief applications, which built up during the Trump administration, from borrowers who said they were defrauded by their for-profit colleges. The office also expanded the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and streamlined debt cancellation for permanently disabled borrowers.\nLast year, the FSA launched a new income-driven repayment plan, known as SAVE (Saving on a Valuable Education), which offers  generous terms for low-income student loan borrowers.\nCordray also oversaw the unprecedented return to repayment after the three-plus-year pandemic pause ended last year.\nWhen the Biden administration tapped Cordray to run FSA, it was viewed as a win for progressives.\nDuring Cordray’s tenure at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — an agency spearheaded by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren — he made it a priority to protect student loan borrowers. The agency secured more than $480 million in debt forgiveness for borrowers who had taken out loans to go to Corinthian Colleges, a now-defunct, for-profit school. It also sued Navient, one of the biggest federal student loan servicers, for allegedly processing payments incorrectly. Navient has denied the allegations, and the lawsuit is ongoing.\n“I’m grateful to Rich for his commitment to building a country that doesn’t just work for the wealthy and well connected, but for all Americans,” Warren said in a statement sent to CNN on Friday.\n",

        "content": "Editor’s Note: Warning: This story contains a graphic image.\nHamas released a video of Israeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin on Wednesday, the first proof that he survived being badly wounded during his capture on October 7.\nGoldberg-Polin, then 23, was kidnapped from the Nova music festival during Hamas’ attacks on Israel when more than 1,200 people died and more than 200 people were taken hostage.\nHe is shown in the undated video with part of his left arm missing several inches above the hand.\nVideo filmed on October 7 showed Goldberg-Polin being taken hostage with his arm severely injured. A firsthand account from a young woman, who was in a bunker with him when Hamas attacked, said he had helped to throw grenades out, before his arm was blown off from the elbow down.\nThe latest video shows Goldberg-Polin sitting in a chair, addressing the camera. Gesturing occasionally with his injured arm, he identifies himself and gives his date of birth and parents’ names.\nHe says he has been “here for almost 200 days,” suggesting the video was filmed shortly before Tuesday, the 200th day of the war.\nGoldberg-Polin’s hair is cropped short in the video, which is edited with a number of cuts from wide shot to close up.\nHe criticizes the Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as other Israeli hostages in Hamas propaganda videos have done. Held captive in Gaza for six months, he is almost certainly speaking under duress.\nHe mentions Israeli government ministers sitting down to holiday dinners with their families, an apparent reference to the Jewish holiday of Passover, which began Monday night and is traditionally celebrated with a family dinner.\nHe urges his own family to stay strong for him and finishes by saying he hopes he was able to give them some comfort on the holiday.\nThe Biden administration received the video Monday – two days before Hamas made it public – and officials have since been in contact with Goldberg-Polin’s family, according to a US official. The FBI’s Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell is running point on examining the video for any potential evidence and information that can be gleaned about Goldberg-Polin and his captivity, the official said.\nGoldberg-Polin is among the most recognizable of the 129 hostages who remain in Gaza. Banners and murals are displayed in Jerusalem, saying: “Bring Hersh Home,” and his parents Rachel and Jonathan regularly meet top US officials in Washington to press the case of the hostages.\nOf the 129 October 7 hostages still being held in Gaza, the Israeli government believes 33 are dead.\nFollowing the release of the video, the Goldberg-Polin family demanded immediate action to release their son and the other hostages still held in Gaza.\n“Seeing the video of Hersh today is overwhelming. We are relieved to see him alive, but we are also concerned about his health and wellbeing as well as that of all the other hostages and all of those suffering in this region,” his parents Rachel Goldberg-Polin and Jon Polin said in a video statement.\nThe Goldberg-Polin family has called on the negotiating parties, including Qatar, Egypt, the United States, Hamas, and Israel, to intensify efforts and strike a deal that would reunite families and end their suffering.\nThey also sent a personal message to their son, “Hersh, we heard your voice today for the first time in 201 days. If you can hear us, know that we love you. Stay strong, survive.”\nThe hostage video released Wednesday of Goldberg-Polin was the first proof he had survived his injuries sustained on October 7. Previous footage, taken on the day of that attack, shows Hamas fighters leading him away from the bomb shelter with part of his arm missing.\nThe first time Goldberg-Polin’s parents saw that video was following an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper in October. The pair were recalling eyewitness accounts of how their son was taken into captivity during a live TV interview, when Cooper realized he had heard details of the story before.\nDays earlier, an Israeli soldier at the site of the Nova music festival had shown Cooper a video of Hamas fighters lobbing grenades into a bomb shelter. The video also showed a young Israeli man – with his hand blown off and bone protruding from his wrist – being marched out of the shelter and thrown along with four others into the back of a truck. Cooper realized this was Rachel and John’s son.\nNot wanting to spring the news on them on live TV, Cooper contacted them after the interview and asked if they wanted to see the video. They later confirmed the man in the video was their son and asked that the video be shared more widely.\nRachel Goldberg-Polin was told by eyewitnesses that as many as 29 people had huddled together in the shelter before Hamas began to throw grenades inside. Eight people survived by hiding under the bodies of the dead, while her son was one of several hostages taken.\nRachel Goldberg-Polin has campaigned for her son’s release for the past six months. She told CNN in January that she wears a piece of tape marking each day that has passed since Hersh was snatched by Hamas fighters.\nHersh, who is left-handed, was set to go on a round-the-world trip he had planned. On December 27, when he had been scheduled to leave, his mother went to the airport with friends and handed stickers of Hersh to passengers on his flight, asking them to send photos from places they visit.\nCNN’s MJ Lee contributed reporting.\n",
