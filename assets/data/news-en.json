    "content": "American Pickers star Danielle Colby has thanked Mike Wolfe for his \"epic\" donation to her exhibition at the Stripping History Museum.\nThe two reality TV stars cohost the show on the History Channel. The program follows them as they scour the country for forgotten gems in junkyards and basements, and recycle and renovate them while meeting quirky characters along the way. The two often take to social media to share their love and support for each other.\nOver the years Colby—who is also a burlesque dancer and an OnlyFans model—has acquired some of the most coveted pieces of burlesque and striptease history, which she is compiling for her space at the Stripping History Museum. This week, she posted to her Instagram account to share the poster Wolfe had given her, which she is adding to the collection.\nNewsweek emailed spokespeople for Colby and Wolfe for comment outside of normal business hours.\n\"Gifts that pique my curiosity and allow my obsessive tendencies to run amok with exhaustive research are my absolute favorite! I'm so excited to hang this rare piece of Burly history in my Stripping History Museum,\" she wrote in the Instagram post, sharing a photo of herself standing alongside the poster.\n\"Thank you @americanpickers Thank you my awesome brother @mikewolfeamericanpicker for this epic donation of this (This Seasons Maddest Merriest Musical Comedy Lovely Adorable Gay DAWN! Gals and Gags, Legs and Laughs! there's nothing like a burlesque show, a lot of laughs a lot of thrills, and a blush or two! America's funniest comedians and the world's most beautiful girls! Adult entertainment\") original poster!\"\nColby told her followers that the poster was specifically made for racier venues during a time in history when there was a lot of back-and-forth on blue laws or moral codes. A blue law prohibits or restricts certain activities on specific days, such as a Sunday.\nShe added: \"My guess is that this poster went against the blue law in whatever theater [it] found itself in and the artist had to go back in and pencil in bikini tops and G strings where they did not exist before. This was a pretty normal thing.\n\"I actually used to do this type of work in my father's photography studio. He learned it from his mother and father. It's the exact same technique that my grandparents used in their photography studio my father used in his and I used in mine before I became a part of American Pickers. These little things always fascinate me.\"\nPeople took to the comments to praise Colby and share their appreciation for the work she does, with one person writing: \"This is so cool. I can't wait to see your museum. Congratulations.\"\n\"Wow! It's amazing!!!!! I am so excited for the museum to open up. I am looking forward to all its glory and for strippers to finally be the main characters [sic] in hi(her)story,\" said another.\nA third added: \"Thanks for all you are doing to bring this history to the forefront. You're awesome!\"\nColby and Wolfe have been co-hosting American Pickers together ever since Frank Fritz left at the end of Season 21. Fritz, who appeared on the program from 2010 to 2020, died on September 30 from the complications from a stroke while in hospice care. He was 60.\nFritz's health took a significant hit in 2022 after he had a stroke that left him in a wheelchair. He also had Crohn's disease—a chronic inflammatory bowel condition that affects the lining of the digestive tract—for several decades.\nWolfe previously had to reassure fans that Colby was still involved in the show after she was missing from a behind-the-scenes video. Twelve people were featured in a video that Wolfe previously shared on his social channels, ranging from other pickers and co-executive producers to production supervisors and a director of photography. Fans noticed that Wolfe's co-host Colby was missing.\n\"She still rocking with us,\" Wolfe said to one concerned commenter and wrote to others that she was back in the office.\n",

    "content": "An Azerbaijani airliner carrying 67 people crashed in southwestern Kazakhstan on Wednesday, killing at least 38 who were on board, according to Kazakh authorities.\nIn a sprawling rescue operation, 29 survivors including two children were pulled from the wreckage near the city of Aktau, Kazakhstan’s Deputy Prime Minister Kanat Bozumbayev said, adding that 11 were in critical condition.\nAzerbaijan Airlines flight J2-8243 was traveling from the Azerbaijani capital Baku to Grozny in the Russian region of Chechnya before it made an emergency landing approximately 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) from Aktau, the carrier said.\nFootage from the crash site captured the moment dazed survivors emerged from the charred plane. All of the survivors have been taken to hospitals, Kazakh authorities said earlier.\n“The bodies are in poor condition, mostly burnt, all collected,” Bozumbayev said. “Now they will be in the morgue, and identification will take place.”\nThere is only one survivor whose identity remains unknown, according to Bozumbayev. “She is unconscious, has no documents, and is in the hospital,” he added.\nA search team has located the plane’s black box, the Azerbaijan state news agency AZERTAC reported, and the Kazakhstan government has set up a commission to investigate the cause of the crash and assist passengers’ families. The government will cooperate with Azerbaijan on the investigation, it said.\nKazakhstan’s Ministry of Emergency Situations said its teams found the aircraft on fire upon arrival at the scene, with rescue units extinguishing the fire on arrival.\nVideo of the crash showed the Embraer 190 plane erratically circling the airfield before the crash. As it hit the ground, the aircraft burst into flames, with bloodied passengers emerging from the wreckage shortly after.\nOne woman who joined the rescue effort told Radio Free Europe’s Kazakh Service that she witnessed a devastating scene that brought her to tears.\n“The front (part of the plane) was on fire. We rescued the survivors. Their bodies were covered in blood. They were crying. Everyone was asking for help,” Elmira, who only provided her first name, said.\nElmira said there were people of all ages among the survivors, including men, women, teenagers and a small child.\n“A little girl came out. She looked at me and said, ‘Save my mom, my mom is still there. She was crying and begging, ‘Please save her, save her,’” she said.\nElmira said that she had traveled by bus to the site of the crash and that she and other volunteers led survivors to the bus to “prevent people from freezing.”\n“It was cold outside. None of them had jackets, just light sweaters. We kept them on the bus until the ambulance arrived,” she said.\nThere were 62 passengers and 5 crew members on board, Kazakhstan’s transport ministry said in a preliminary report. It said 37 of the passengers were Azerbaijan citizens, and 16 from Russia, along with six from Kazakhstan and three from Kyrgyzstan, according to preliminary data. None of those who survived were Kazakh nationals, Deputy Prime Minister Kanat Bozumbayev said.\nAzerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev has cut short his trip to Russia as a result of the incident, Kazakhstan’s state news agency reported.\nAliyev’s government declared a day of national mourning for December 26, Azerbaijani state media reported.\nRussia’s aviation watchdog said in a statement that preliminary information suggested the pilot had decided to make an emergency landing after a bird strike.\nOfficials did not immediately explain why the plane had crossed the sea, but the crash came shortly after drone strikes hit southern Russia. Drone activity has shut airports in the area in the past and the nearest Russian airport on the plane’s flight path was closed on Wednesday morning.\nOn Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it would be wrong to speculate about the cause of the plane crash before an investigation had been carried out, according to Russian state media RIA Novosti.\nEmbraer, a Brazilian manufacturer, said in a statement it is closely monitoring the situation and “we remain fully committed to supporting the relevant authorities.”\nAccording to the Azerbaijan Airlines, the plane had passed a full technical inspection in October this year, Kazakhstan’s state news agency reported.\nKazakhstan’s Transport Police Department opened a pre-trial investigation under a part of the criminal code which involves the “violation of safety rules during the operation of a vehicle, resulting in the accidental death of two or more people,” state-run news agency Kazinform reported.\nAccording to AZERTAC, the pilot had extensive experience and had flown more than 15,000 hours.\nBozumbayev said it was impossible to establish “even a preliminary cause” but that experts were looking into it, Kazinform reported.\nMeanwhile, Azerbaijan Airlines said it has suspended flights from Baku to Grozny and Makhachkala, the largest city of Dagestan, until the investigation into the crash is complete.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin expressed his condolences to those involved in the crash, and said a Russian Emergencies Ministry plane with medical personnel and equipment is flying to Kazakhstan to assist.\n“Let’s hope for a speedy recovery of the injured ones and, of course, I am sure, a thorough investigation will be carried out. We will coordinate the work of our special and aviation services on all issues related to this tragedy,” he said during a summit for the Commonwealth of Independent States.\nThis story has been updated.

    "content": "Hope your Santa hat was fastened, because Beyoncé gave us the ultimate “Cowboy Carter” gift this Christmas.\nThe superstar spread holiday cheer during Wednesday’s Halftime Show at the Christmas Day Texans-Ravens NFL game in her hometown of Houston, Texas, marking the first time Beyoncé performed songs from her hit 2024 album “Cowboy Carter” in front of a live audience.\nBeyoncé began her iconic performance on horseback, literally riding in while singing “16 Carriages.” After dismounting with classic cars arranged in the background, she began her cover of The Beatles’ classic hit “Blackbird,” accompanied by country singers Tanner Adell, Brittney Spencer, Tiera Kennedy and Reyna Roberts, who she collaborated on the song with.\nPost Malone made a surprise cameo to perform their collaboration “Levii’s Jeans,” following Bey’s duet with country singer Shaboozey.\nBacked by a full marching band, Beyoncé also performed “Ya Ya” and was joined on the field by her daughter Blue Ivy, who danced next to her mother during the song “Texas Hold ‘Em.”\n“Merry Christmas, god bless y’all,” Beyoncé said at the end of the set, as she was raised high above the field on a white platform.\nBeyoncé is no newcomer to major NFL-related events. The Grammy-winner headlined the 2013 Super Bowl in New Orleans and joined Coldplay and Bruno Mars on the field during the 2016 Super Bowl show.\nShe also used an ad spot that aired during the 2024 Super Bowl to announce “Cowboy Carter,” the highly anticipated “Act II” follow up to her 2023 album “Renaissance.”\n“Cowboy Carter” was released in March and has gone on to earn 11 Grammy nods.\nQueen Bey teased this week’s performance on Tuesday with a cheeky video of herself stopping a rolling football with her sky-high heels while finger-picking a banjo along to her popular song “Texas Hold ‘Em.”\nThe video is made to appear as though it’s buffering at one point – with a red spinning circle on Beyoncé’s nose – poking fun at Netflix’s previous lagging livestream issues that many called attention to during the slightly glitchy livestream of the Mike Tyson-Jake Paul fight. After the faux ‘glitch,’ Beyoncé is heard giggling and winks to the camera.\nA representative for Netflix previously told CNN that they made additional optimizations of their systems to improve the viewing quality and better handle the large-scale viewership that they anticipate the Christmas Day NFL games to draw.\nNetflix was the streaming host of both the Chiefs-Steelers game – which was played earlier in the day – and the Texans-Ravens game on Christmas Day.\nMariah Carey, the so-called Queen of Christmas herself, also made a splashy appearance during Netflix’s Christmas Day NFL games when she appeared in a pre-recorded video of her classic Christmas hit “All I Want For Christmas is You,” which was streamed ahead of both games.\nCarey’s performance marked the song’s 30th anniversary and showcased the Grammy-winning singer performing on a rooftop in Los Angeles. Carey was surrounded by dancers and children in Christmas-themed costumes and sang amid a faux snowfall.\n",

The Gaza-based television channel is affiliated with the Palestine Islamic Jihad militant group.\nAyman Al-Jadi, Faisal Abu Al-Qumsan, Mohammed Al-Lada’a, Ibrahim Al-Sheikh Ali, and Fadi Hassouna were all sleeping in the vehicle when the strike hit, other journalists at the scene said.\nFootage of the aftermath seen by CNN shows the vehicle in flames with the words “TV” and “PRESS” in large letters visible on the back doors. Another video seen by CNN shows it completely engulfed by flames.\nAl-Quds Today Television condemned the attack and said the five were killed “while performing their journalistic and humanitarian duty.”\nThe Israeli military confirmed it carried out the strike on what it said was an “Islamic Jihad terrorist cell inside in the area of Nuseirat,” but did not provide any proof for its allegations.\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a US-based non-profit group, has said at least 141 journalists and media workers have been killed in Gaza, the West Bank, Israel and Lebanon since October 7th last year, “making it the deadliest period for journalists since CPJ began gathering data in 1992.”\nOf those killed, 133 were Palestinians in Gaza, who “face particularly high risks as they try to cover the conflict.”\nEarlier this month, an Israeli airstrike in Gaza killed an Al Jazeera photojournalist, one year to the day after an attack killed one of his colleagues.\nAhmad Al-Louh, 39, and four other people were killed by the strike that targeted an office of the Civil Defense service in central Gaza’s Nuseirat Camp area, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which treated the casualties.\nAl Jazeera condemned the attack, saying Al-Louh was “brutally killed” while covering a Civil Defense attempt to rescue a family that had been severely injured in an earlier bombing.\nMohammad Al Sawalhi, a stringer for CNN in Gaza, said Al-Louh was well known among journalists in Gaza and was often embedded with the Civil Defense in his capacity as a journalist, covering rescue missions.\nThe Israeli military confirmed it targeted the Civil Defense offices in a “precise strike,” claiming the site was being used as a “command-and-control center” by Hamas and alleging that Al-Louh was a “terrorist” who had previously served with Islamic Jihad. The IDF did not provide any proof for its allegations.\n",

National Geographic says these semi-aquatic mammals live in the northern and central parts of South America, though a small invasive population has been found in Florida too.\nThese animals are known for their friendly and sociable nature, and have become a popular tourist attraction in countries like Brazil and Japan, where capybara cafes offer people the chance to hang out with the rodents and pet them.\nGeorgia-based veterinarian Jess Kirk says in a Vet Explains Pets article that due to their calming presence, capybaras are known to help reduce stress and anxiety, and are often used in animal-assisted therapy programs to provide emotional support and comfort.\nWhile overall capybaras are not considered an endangered species, there are lots of vicious predators after them, including jaguars, pumas, caimans, snakes like the boa constrictor, and birds of prey like the caracara and black vulture, among others.\nIn some areas their existence is also severely threatened by people who hunt them for their skin, who have already wiped out entire local populations. These creatures are also impacted by the issue of deforestation, as some of their natural habitats are being converted to make way for crop fields and cattle ranches.\nCapybaras have long been a key part of internet culture, becoming the source of memes and viral posts. According to a 2021 article in Vice, the online popularity of the creatures is likely down to their unusual size and appearance, as well as the perception of them as representing the underdog.\nInternet users could not believe their eyes, and some were jealous that their schools never brought in such special guests.\nOne user, Moxie said: \"Ok..it's not just a capy...ITS A BABY CAPY!!!!!!!!!!\"\nButterfly wrote: \"What university is this?

It is a hazardous location for stowaways, who could encounter low oxygen levels, hypothermia, crushing, or the risk of falling during the flight.\nStowaways often get crushed when the landing gear retracts, as there is not much room.\nHiding in an airplane's wheel well is the most common method used by stowaways in their attempts to reach their destination. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, at least 77 percent of individuals who have tried to unlawfully board an aircraft this way have died.\nAs the flight reaches higher altitudes, conditions worsen. Oxygen levels drop significantly, making it difficult for stowaways to stay conscious. Outside temperatures can plummet to as low as 75 or 80 degrees below zero, severely affecting blood circulation. Stowaways face the risk of frostbite and even hypothermia.\nUnited Airlines told CNN in a statement on Wednesday: \"Upon arrival at Kahului airport in Maui on Tuesday, a body was found in the wheel well of one of the main landing gears on a United aircraft.\"\n\"The wheel well was only accessible from outside of the aircraft,\" United Airlines said. \"At this time, it is not clear how or when the person accessed the wheel well.\"\n\"United is working with law enforcement authorities on the investigation,\" the statement read.\nInvestigations into the mysterious death are ongoing as the Maui Police Department continues its inquiries.\n",

    "content": "Few brands have had their future questioned in recent years like Infiniti. Despite that loud criticism from industry watchers, enthusiasts and analysts alike, Infiniti is driving forward, aiming to redefine modern luxury.\nKey to this is the redesigned, next-generation Infiniti QX80. The flagship three-row sport utility vehicle (SUV) is larger and more refined than before, serving as a showcase of what Infiniti is capable of as Nissan's premium arm.\n\"As a foundation of our business strategy, the all-new 2025 Infiniti QX80 sets the tone for our product renaissance and exemplifies our commitment to redefining modern luxury,\" Craig Keeys, group vice president, Infiniti Americas, told Newsweek. \"As our flagship SUV, the QX80 embodies bold design, advanced technology and expert craftsmanship, showcasing the very best of Infiniti. This momentum will carry through our lineup, including the popular QX60 and highly anticipated, all-new QX65.\"\nIn 2023, the Infiniti brand reported a 40 percent year-over-year increase in new vehicle deliveries. This year, through the end of the third quarter, the company's sales are down 12.8 percent compared to 2023. The new QX80 went on sale in North America in the July of this year.\nThe largest QX80 markets in the U.S. are Dallas, Houston and Tampa with New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago picking up steam. Power couples, those Infiniti defines are as partners that are decision makers, are the key buyers. They are typically married with children and want a new SUV with bod design, technology that integrates easily into their lives, and considers their vehicle an extension of hospitality.\nOf the QX80s that Infiniti sells, the QX80 Autograph trim level is the highest-selling trim level. That, the highest grade offered, has a starting manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) of $110,595, a $25,045 premium over the entry level QX80 Pure model.\nAt that price, the QX80 competes with the Mercedes-Benz GLS (starting MSRP of $89,200), BMW X7 ($84,300), and Audi Q7 ($60,500), as well as the GMC Yukon ($66,900) and Cadillac Escalade ($87,595).\n\"This is the first time we're transacting cars that are above $110-120,000. For QX80, the average household income we were targeting [is] around $500,000, and we're getting the vast majority of those who buy the Autograph, about 60 percent of the mix right now, are above a million dollars of household income,\" Ponz Pandikuthira, regional senior vice president and Chief Planning Officer, Nissan Americas, told Newsweek, pointing out that signals great success because when you have a million-dollar wage, you, \"have the choice of just about any vehicle.\"\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, U.S. Census Bureau and a 2022 survey by YouGov, 0.5 percent of U.S. household incomes are $1 million or more. One percent of U.S. households bring in at least $500,000 annually. There are approximately 131 million households in the country.\nThe luxury and premium family SUV market is competitive, with Acura and Cadillac encroaching on true luxury territory and technology beginning to serve as a greater differentiator than price though the two often correlate. Those with high household incomes aim to pick vehicles that are status symbols as much as they are competent daily drivers.\nInfiniti plans to address that market with another new SUV, the QX65, a two-row midsize model, in the coming year. It is expected to play off trends started by BMW then further materialized by Mercedes and Audi, delivering a sloped rooftop akin to fastback-like design.\nMercedes called them Coupes, Audi named theirs Sportback. Infiniti's approach is to add a five where the zero is in the model name, and give the SUV a bit of its own personality. They've already proven this out with the QX55, which has sold about half as well as the QX50 in recent years, increasing the total number of Infinitis sold of their size when sales numbers are combined.\n",

    "content": "With the presidential election decided and the once and future president Donald J. Trump poised to reenter the White House on January 20, America stands on the threshold of a new era of prosperity at home and peace abroad. The final year before the republic celebrates the 250th anniversary of its independence will see the end of four years of chaos masquerading as \"unity\" under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, a disastrously unqualified presidential candidate who offered more decay, decline, and disorder masquerading as \"joy.\"\nTrump's return, which Harris will be constitutionally obliged to certify on January 6, will also represent a rare break with rule by Washington's corrupt and discredited administrative-managerial caste in favor of an administration determined to demolish its structures, banish its values, and prevent its return.\nWith a trifecta of Republican control in the White House and both Houses of Congress, along with a Supreme Court majority, Trump will have the power to maintain and expand the tax cuts of his first administration. He will also have the opportunity to slash the bloated federal budget by as much as one-third, the goal set by Department of Government Efficiency co-chief Elon Musk, a shrewd businessman and tech leader who also happens to be the richest man in the world. These measures will both restore hard-earned capital to the American people and significantly lessen irresponsible public spending and debt liability. The overall effect should reduce or eliminate lingering Biden-era inflation while powering the same levels of respectable growth that benefited the country in Trump's first administration.\nMeanwhile, protections for American jobs and manufacturing will reverse decades of economically harmful and strategically short-sighted decline and strike a blow against middle American poverty, the national addiction epidemic, and \"deaths of despair\" that have kept much of the population from prosperity. Pro-growth policies in the energy sector will restore the economically and strategically essential goal of American energy independence, a major achievement that Biden recklessly abandoned.\nThe powerful legacy of Trump's first administration has already attracted impressive pledges of foreign investment as well as a near-immediate willingness to talk peace from all sides in the conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. It has even prompted unexpected Mexican resolve to work productively on controlling the United States' southern border and drug trafficking, issues Biden and Harris barely addressed and tried hard to avoid in their failed presidential campaigns. The same foreign leaders who were content to snub or ignore Biden's feckless foreign policy team up until just a few weeks ago are now preparing to work for lasting solutions that the incumbent president's absent leadership consistently failed to realize but that Trump is well positioned to deliver.\nThe Biden-Harris administration saw our greatest enemies on the march to disrupt an American-led world with little opposition. The incoming Trump administration, by contrast with Biden's sedate and self-involved Washington, already sees them beating a retreat. With Trump back in office, the year 2025 will likely see decisive ends to the wars and the expansion of security arrangements—such as the historic Abraham Accords of 2020—that will assure renewed American ascendancy. An ever-more-isolated Vladimir Putin will have to comfort himself with dubious gains in eastern Ukraine while Iran's mullahs sullenly accept the destruction of their clients in Syria, Lebanon, Gaza, and Yemen; lose their lucrative international oil markets; abandon their dreams of regional hegemony; and fall asleep every night hoping they do not share the fate of Bashar al-Assad.\nAs American confidence and wealth grow under Trump's restored leadership, the president-elect also seems ready to end any role in national government for the destructive anti-American ideologies of critical race theory (CRT) and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)—thought systems that subordinate merit, hard work, and excellence to race, skin color, and grievance. Preliminary signs suggest that few Americans will miss either CRT or DEI, which state and local governments, courts, the private sector, and, increasingly, even the fading left-leaning bastions of academia and legacy media are racing to abandon. Unburdened by what has been, the hardworking majority of all backgrounds will find routes to prosperity without government and its malign adjunct ideologues standing in the way.\nThe fight will be hard, and resistance may be formidable. The GOP's congressional majorities are slim, and the administrative state is as resourceful as it is ruthless. Most Democrats and a declining but still powerful cohort of establishment Republicans would prefer a weaker nation without Trump over a stronger America with him. But if we have learned anything about Donald Trump over the past decade, the safe bet is that America in 2025 will be stronger, freer, wealthier, healthier, and happier than it has been for a long time and possibly ever. Truly, it will be great again.\nPaul du Quenoy is President of the Palm Beach Freedom Institute.\nThe views expressed in this article are the writer's own.\n",

    "content": "Scientists have been searching the skies for an extraterrestrial intelligence for years and found nothing. However, many believe the chances of success are improving fast, so if 2025 turns out to be the year that we make first contact with a non-Earthly intelligence, how will people react?\n\"I've bet everyone a cup of Starbucks that this will happen, so obviously I believe the chances are good,\" said Seth Shostak, a speaker, author and senior astronomer at the SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) Institute.\nBorn in 1943, Shostak has observed scientific efforts to find an ET intelligence since his youth growing up in New York City. He explained why he is now more optimistic than ever.\n\"This is primarily based on the unrelenting march of technology. Every two years, more or less, the speed at which we're searching for a signal doubles, so I suspect that such a discovery is imminent.\"\nFinding an ET intelligence would compare to Europeans discovering the New World and its native inhabitants at the end of the 15th century, Shostak says, but be even more important.\n\"It will be an inflection point for humanity, and I suspect that future histories will split the human experience into time before and after the discovery of other beings.\nShostak dismisses the idea that people would panic, given that most Americans believe that aliens exist.\nRather, he says, many people would be fascinated and would try to reach out to the aliens.\n\"You can be sure that everybody in the world who has the capability to broadcast a response will try and do so, right.\n\"You know, just talk to us, that kind of thing. And I'm sure that would happen. And honestly, I don't see anything wrong with that. That's what humans do.\"\nThere will be some, says Shostak, that will not want to respond to the alien signal at all, people who think that it would be like shouting in the jungle.\n\"You don't know what the consequences of doing that might be. And keep in mind that any society that could actually hear anything we said could actually pick up a signal, they would willy-nilly be more advanced technically than we are.\n\"So you know, maybe it's not a good idea to let them know that we're here now.\"\n\"They [aliens] might decide that, well, okay, there's a world there that has obviously the raw materials for a technological society, so let's go take them.\n\"They might not just welcome us with open arms and offer us some hors d'oeuvres or whatever.\"\nThe instinct to lie low would be pointless, in any case, says Shostak, as through our television, radio, and radar stations we are advertising our existence to the cosmos 24/7.\nThen there will be the optimists, he says, who will see the arrival of ET as an opportunity.\n\"Maybe they could tell us all sorts of useful stuff that otherwise we're going to spend the next couple of centuries figuring out for ourselves.\"\nMany other people might react by trying to figure out what the content of the alien signal is. Everyone, says Shostak, could play a part in that.\n\"If we get some kind of message from them that we don't understand, that could be that could make all kinds of impacts.\n\"The next thing to happen, in my opinion, would be to put whatever is on that signal, whatever modulation, whatever message, just put it on the internet and let people try and figure it out.\n\"It's like deciphering the hieroglyphics and the 1830s—just let a lot of people try.\"\nThere could be a profound religious reaction from people, Shostak says, because the arrival of ET may lead people to question their beliefs.\n\"Well, what happened in the 18th century when Europeans began landing on these islands in the Pacific? And all the ones that were inhabited had religious beliefs.\"\n\"What effect did it have when the Europeans showed up on these big wooden sailing ships that these guys didn't have, and it pretty much wiped out most of their religions.\n\"Because the attitude was these guys can sail across the ocean to get to us. Whatever religion they've has more mojo, if you will, than our religion. So they switched over in most cases.\"\nGiven the presence of rovers on Mars it's possible microbial life will be found there in coming years. While not as dramatic as a signal from an ET intelligence, Shostak says of this potential discovery; \"I wouldn't sell it short.\"\n\"I wouldn't underestimate the impact of that, because if we were to find, even just microbes on Mars or even dead microbes on Mars, that would tell you that life is not a miracle, right?\"\n\"Life can spring up anywhere where their conditions are reasonably salubrious. And I think that that will affect some fraction of the populace in a fairly dramatic way, because there are plenty of people out there who figure that Earth is very special, because we've got life.\n\"If we were to find that biology got to start on Mars too, it would once again underscore the fact that we're not terribly special, something that our moms never told us, and would probably, be disquieting to many people.\"\nOf the UFO and recent drone sightings phenomena in the northeast U.S., Shostak says that, while more than half the American public think at least some of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) are alien craft, he doesn't believe it.\n\"Are drones flying over New Jersey because the aliens are interested in New Jersey culture?\"\nShostak thinks that when we find a signal from an ET intelligence it might not have come from a life form at all.\n\"Personally—if we pick up a signal—I don't expect it would be the result of some biological being transmitting something into space.\n\"Biological intelligence is, from my point of view, merely a weigh station to the development of synthetic intelligence—thinking machines.\n\"I think our descendants living in the next century will find it quaint that we still figured that extra-terrestrial intelligence would be housed in a living being.\"\n",

    "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\nThis year, scientists were able to pull back the curtain on mysteries surrounding figures across history, both known and unknown, to reveal more about their unique stories.\nIn some cases, analysis of ancient DNA helped fill knowledge gaps and change preconceived notions. A prime example is how aDNA research is reframing the way people understand the archaeological site of Pompeii, which remains trapped beneath a layer of ash thousands of years after Mount Vesuvius’ eruption in AD 79 doomed the Roman town.\nGenetic traces collected from the bones of victims showed that what was once considered to be a mother holding her son in their final moments was an unrelated adult male who likely offered comfort to a child before they perished, and they challenged other long-held assumptions.\nHere are some of the ways science sparked a new understanding of historical figures in 2024, and in some cases, led to more mysteries that have yet to be untangled.\nA detailed analysis of tooth enamel, tartar and bone collagen helped researchers uncover details about “Vittrup Man,” a Stone Age migrant who died violently in a swamp in northwest Denmark about 5,200 years ago.\nHis remains, recovered from a peat bog in Vittrup, Denmark, in 1915, were found alongside a wooden club that was likely used to beat him over the head. But little else was known about him.\nUsing cutting-edge analytical methods, Anders Fischer, project researcher in the department of historical studies at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, and his colleagues set out to “find the individual behind the bone” and tell the story of the oldest known immigrant in Denmark’s history.\nVittrup Man grew up along the Scandinavian coast and belonged to a hunter-gatherer community, enjoying a diet of fish, seals and whales. But his life changed drastically in his late teens when he made the move to Denmark and shifted to a farmer’s diet, eating sheep and goat. He died between the ages of 30 and 40.\nVittrup Man may have been killed as a sacrifice, or perhaps he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. But Fischer found the use of multiple techniques to uncover aspects of his identity gratifying.\n“In the Vittrup case we meet a genuine first-generation immigrant and can follow his remarkable geographic and dietary transition from northern to southern Scandinavia and from a fisher-hunter-gatherer to a farmer way of life,” he said.\nSeparately, researchers were able to connect the identity of a skeleton found in a castle well to a passage from an 800-year-old Norse text.\nThe Sverris saga, which related the story of the real-life King Sverre Sigurdsson, includes a description of an invading army tossing the body of a dead man down a well at Norway’s Sverresborg castle in 1197 in a likely attempt to poison the water supply.\nA team of scientists recently studied bones uncovered in the castle’s well in 1938. Using radiocarbon dating, the researchers determined that the remains were about 900 years old. Genetic sequencing of tooth samples laid bare that “Well-man” had a medium skin tone, blue eyes, and light brown or blond hair. And in a twist, his genetics couldn’t be traced to the local population.\n“The biggest surprise for all of us was that the Well-man did not come from the local population, but rather that his ancestry traces back to a specific region in southern Norway. That suggests the sieging army threw one of their own dead into the well,” study coauthor Michael D. Martin, a professor in the department of natural history at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology’s University Museum in Trondheim, said in October.\nImprovements in molecular genetics over nearly two decades have helped researchers get to the bottom of a longstanding historical puzzle of a so-called “lost prince” who appeared seemingly out of nowhere in mid-19th century Germany.\nFor 200 years, there was speculation that an enigmatic man named Kaspar Hauser was secretly a member of German royalty. When he was found wandering without identification in Nuremberg in May 1828 at the age of 16, Hauser was barely able to communicate with those questioning him.\nA story about Hauser being a kidnapped prince, taken from the royal family of Baden in what’s now southwest Germany, spread like wildfire.\nRelated article\nScientists think they know why Stonehenge was rebuilt thousands of years ago\nThere have been multiple studies of genetic data taken from items that belonged to Hauser, but the conflicting results led to a stalemate with no answers.\nThis year, researchers conducted a new analysis of Hauser’s hair samples and were able to prove that his mitochondrial DNA, or genetic code passed down on the maternal side, did not match the mitochondrial DNA from the Baden family.\nDisproving the royal hoax may have solved one mystery, but another one has taken its place. Just who was this man? As his tombstone reads, Hauser remains “the riddle of his time.”\nClassical composer Ludwig van Beethoven died at 56 in 1827 after a lifetime of ailments including deafness, liver disease and gastrointestinal complaints. The composer expressed his wish that his ailments be studied and shared so “as far as possible at least the world will be reconciled to me after my death.”\nIn May, researchers published a study showing high levels of lead detected in authenticated locks of Beethoven’s hair and suggested the composer had lead poisoning, which may have contributed to his recurring health woes.\nThe findings built on previous revelations after Beethoven’s genome was made publicly available to investigate the complicated nuances of his health.\nIn addition to lead, Beethoven’s locks also contained increased amounts of arsenic and mercury — but how did they get there? The substances were likely from an accumulation of a lifetime diet of fish from the polluted Danube River and plumbed wine, which was sweetened and preserved with lead.\nThe new findings add to a better understanding of the composer as well as the complex, sweeping symphonies he left behind that orchestras still play around the world.\n“People say, ‘The music is the music, why do we need to know about any of this stuff?’ But in Beethoven’s life, there is a connection between his suffering and the music,” William Meredith, Beethoven scholar and study coauthor, said in May.\nA study of skeletal remains using new DNA analysis techniques shed light on the fate of family members of the first US president, George Washington, in March.\nWashington’s younger brother Samuel, who died in 1781, and 19 other members of the family were buried in a cemetery at Samuel’s estate near Charles Town, West Virginia.\nBut some of the graves were unmarked, most likely to prevent grave robbing, Courtney L. Cavagnino, a research scientist with the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System’s Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory, told CNN in March.\nCavagnino led a team that studied remains excavated from the cemetery in 1999, identifying two of Samuel’s grandsons as well as their mother. The study team carried out the excavations to find Samuel’s final resting place, but the whereabouts of his grave remain a mystery.\nHowever, the techniques used in the study could be employed to identify unknown remains of those who have served in the military, going as far back as World War II.\nMeanwhile, a separate investigation of unmarked graves found at the British settlement of Jamestown, Virginia, revealed a long-hidden scandal within the family of the colony’s first governor, Thomas West.\nResearchers analyzed DNA from two male skeletons within the graves, and both men were related to West through a shared maternal lineage. One of the men, Capt. William West, was born to West’s spinster aunt, Elizabeth — and illegitimate.\nDetails of West’s birth were deliberately removed from the family’s genealogical records at the time, researchers found, suggesting that the secret of his true parentage is what inspired him to set sail across the Atlantic Ocean and join the colony.\nDanish astronomer Tycho Brahe is associated with celestial discoveries during the 16th century. But he was also an alchemist devoted to brewing secret medicines for elite clients, such as Rudolf II, the Holy Roman emperor.\nRenaissance alchemists kept their work covert, and few alchemical recipes have survived to modern times. Although Brahe’s alchemical lab, located beneath his castle residence and observatory Uraniborg, was destroyed after his death, researchers carried out a chemical analysis of glass and pottery shards recovered from the site.\nThe analysis detected elements such as nickel, copper, zinc, tin, mercury, gold, lead and a big surprise: tungsten, which hadn’t even been described at the time. It’s possible that Brahe isolated it from a mineral without realizing it, but the discovery raises new questions about his secretive work.\nSeparately, centuries after German astronomer Johannes Kepler made sketches of sunspots in 1607 from his observations of the sun’s surface, the pioneering drawings helped scientists piece together the history of the sun’s solar cycle.\nWhile each cycle of waxing and waning solar activity typically takes about 11 years, there have been times when the sun behaved differently than expected. And Kepler’s long-forgotten drawings, made before the advent of telescopes, were dusted off this year when scientists analyzed them to learn more about the Maunder Minimum, a period of extremely weak and abnormal solar cycles between 1645 and 1715.\nKepler’s drawings were made using a camera obscura, a device that utilized a small hole in the wall of the instrument to project the sun’s image on a sheet of paper. His sketches captured sunspots, which helped astronomers determine that the solar cycles were still occurring as expected when Kepler observed them, rather than lasting for abnormally long amounts of time as previously believed.\nBrahe and Kepler, along with Sir Isaac Newton and Galileo Galilei, were giants who replaced the medieval view of the world with a modern one, said Kaare Lund Rasmussen, lead author of the Brahe study and a professor emeritus in the department of physics, chemistry and pharmacy at the University of Southern Denmark.\nAnd this year, both Brahe and Kepler’s centuries-old work have contributed new pieces that help scientists reconstruct the puzzles of the past.\n",

    "content": "The best time to buy an electric vehicle may be right now. That’s because a $7,500 federal tax credit could soon disappear.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has said he will move to eliminate the tax credit, possibly as soon as he takes office. It is even conceivable that the tax credit’s elimination could be made retroactive to the beginning of January, which would give EV buyers only a week left to be certain of locking in the credit.\nRelated article\nTrump may end the $7,500 EV tax credit. Elon Musk and Tesla would reap the rewards\n“I would be very inclined to say yes, it’s going away,” said Ivan Drury, director of insights at car buying site Edmunds. While it’s unclear exactly how Trump would eliminate the credit, Drury said he expects it won’t last long into the new administration. It could be done as part of tax legislation that Republicans are promising early in 2025. Or  a Trump-controlled Internal Revenue Service could simply issue a new rule making the credit unavailable.\n“The simplest route that’s possible, is the one that they’re likely to take,” Drury said.\nBut the tax credit is only part of the reason that it could make sense for potential EV buyers to act sooner than later. The combination of the federal tax incentive, and weakening sales could make this an ideal time to buy an EV.\nThe slowing demand by American buyers, and more choices of EV models, led to record inventories of electric vehicles on dealer lots earlier this year, and that glut remains in place. Drury said that 64% of EVs sitting at dealerships are last year’s models, nearly twice the percentage of traditional internal combustion vehicles. Automakers traditionally release the next year’s models in the fall rather than waiting for the new year.\nThe glut of EVs and increased competition has led legacy automakers to offer attractive financing terms to try to move the older EV models. Data from Edmunds shows that the average lease payment on non-Tesla EVs is down 40% from the start of 2023, far more the drop in transaction price alone. The difference is that the average interest rate on the lease has been cut by more than half.\n“If you buy an EV now, you’re not only sure of getting the EV tax credit that might not be there for much longer, you got incentives from automakers that can’t move them,” said Drury. “You’re doubling down. It won’t get any better.”\nThe loss of the tax credit, and the inevitable weaker demand that would follow, could lead legacy automakers to pull back on their EV production more than they already have, Drury said. So the incentives now being offered could vanish as well.\nThe auto industry will likely fight to preserve the tax credit. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry trade group that includes most automakers – but not Tesla – wrote a letter to Congress in October, ahead of the election, urging that the tax credit remain in place.\nThe letter says US manufacturers rely on the credit to compete with Chinese EV production and advancements. Global automakers have invested billions of dollars in the transition from gasoline powered cars to electric vehicles, and a forced pullback could lead to huge losses.\nBut the group and individual automakers declined to comment on their plans, or their views on what happens if the tax credit goes away, when contacted recently by CNN.\nAnd Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who donated hundreds of millions of dollars to help Trump get elected and who has been spending extensive time with the President-elect, has encouraged Trump to end the credit. Musk has said it would “only help Tesla.”\nRelated article\nElon Musk bet big on Trump. Here’s what he stands to gain — and lose — from his win\nThe disappearance of the tax credit would probably hurt legacy automakers planning to roll out more EVs in the coming years, such as General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, or other small EV upstarts like Rivian, none of which have profited off of EV sales yet, due in large part to vast startup costs. If demand for EVs falls along with the disappearance of the tax credit, those automakers could be forced to pull back on their EV production to trim their losses, reducing competition for Tesla among EV car shoppers.\nEven with the slowing EV demand, many experts still forecast that total US sales of EVs could continue to edge higher, just at a much slower pace than in the past.\n“We still have upwards of 20 EV models coming into the market in 2025,” said Chris Hopson, principal automotive analyst for S&P Global. He said those increased offerings will bring in new buyers, and more electric cars will be sold as a result.\nHe said that if the tax credit disappears early in the year, it could cause S&P to pull back on its EV forecast somewhat, but he would still expect a modest gain. But how the automakers react to the lack of tax credit could determine how much sales fall. They could cut prices more than they have in recent years.\n“Automakers can play with pricing to adjust for lack of credits,” Hopson said.\nAnd some states may step up with their own tax credits to make up for the loss of federal tax credits. That’s something California is looking to do.\nDuring the campaign President-elect Donald Trump frequently criticized EVs, though he qualified that criticism once Musk became one of his more prominent, and financially important, supporters. Still, Trump promised to get rid of an electric vehicle target from the Environmental Protect Agency of a minimum of 35% of new cars sold by 2032, which he refers to as an “EV mandate.”\n",

    "content": "There’s no shortage of laughter in Dennis Perry’s house. Ask him about his grandkids, and he instantly starts to chuckle. And if the subject of fishing or how much he loves his wife, Brenda, comes up, you’re rewarded with a belly laugh.\nThe kids call him “Papa Sunshine,” a nickname befitting a man whose smile you can hear through the phone. That Perry can laugh at all is something of a miracle – especially after all he’s been through.\nIn 2003, Perry, who is White, was convicted and sentenced to two consecutive life sentences in prison for the brutal 1985 slaying of a Black couple named Harold and Thelma Swain at their church in southern Georgia.\nHe has always – emphatically – maintained his innocence: throughout his arrest, his trial and conviction, and every single day of the nearly 21 years he spent incarcerated.\nIn 2020, attorneys with the Georgia Innocence Project and an Atlanta-based international law firm, King & Spalding, presented a judge with a wealth of new DNA evidence to prove what Perry says he knew all along: “You got the wrong man.”\nIn a matter of months, Perry was free from prison, back home in the loving embrace of his wife and the gaggle of kids and grandkids who adore him. But the wrongful conviction stole decades of his life and with Perry’s exoneration came a tidal wave of new questions: How did the justice system get this case so wrong? And if Perry didn’t murder the Swains all those years ago, who did?\nEarlier this month, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation took a step toward answering some of those questions, arresting and charging a man they now accuse of the murders at Rising Daughter Baptist Church nearly 40 years ago.\nBut that arrest, coupled with Perry’s exoneration, has reopened old wounds in this rural Georgia community, and revealed that sometimes, even a broken justice system can’t shatter the human spirit.\nOn a Monday night in March 1985, a White man walked into the vestibule of the Rising Daughter Baptist Church in a small Georgia community known as Spring Bluff.\nInside the chapel, the women of the historically Black congregation were holding a meeting. They were joined that night by Harold Swain, 66, one of the church deacons and a beloved member of the close-knit community near Georgia’s coast.\nA woman who attended the meeting later told police she excused herself just before 9 p.m. and saw a White man with long, blond hair in the church’s entryway.\n“I asked if he wanted something and he (said) ‘yes,’ he wanted to talk to someone and pointed into the church at Deacon Swain,” Vanzola Williams told the Atlanta Journal newspaper the day after the murders.\nSwain went to speak with the man and witnesses later told investigators they heard scuffling in the lobby followed by the unmistakable sounds of gunshots. Everyone ducked behind pews or ran for shelter – everyone except for Swain’s wife, Thelma, 63, who ran toward the lobby and her husband.\nAnother shot rang out and then, silence.\nBy the time police arrived, Harold and Thelma Swain were dead, and the killer was long gone. Police recovered bullet casings, shirt buttons and three pairs of glasses from the scene. Investigators later determined two sets of glasses belonged to the Swains. But the third pair was believed to belong to the killer, court records show. After a closer examination investigators found several “Caucasian hairs” in the glasses.\nThat hair was tested for DNA, a decision that decades later would prove key to exonerating Perry and help lead to the arrest of the alleged killer.\nBut that night, the women of the congregation gave vastly different descriptions of the man in the lobby. Multiple computer-generated sketches were combined into a single composite image of a young White man with long hair and circulated throughout the community.\n“You’ve got to put yourself back in that moment in ‘85 when this horrific thing happens inside this historic Black church,” said Joshua Sharpe, an investigative journalist whose award-winning reporting on the Swains’ murder and Perry’s wrongful conviction will soon be released in the book “The Man No One Believed: The Untold Story of the Georgia Church Murders.”\n“The power of this case, and the weight of it, this doesn’t happen anywhere, let alone here. There are all these tips – we’re talking dozens that at some point becomes hundreds of suspects.”\nBut weeks went by without an arrest, then months, then years. The case grew cold while the Swain family grieved. Harold’s brother, Charlie Swain, and his sister, Pearl Swain Cole, told CNN the sudden loss of their older brother rocked their entire family.\n“It was just a hurting thing due to the fact that somebody would go in church and kill someone,” Swain said. “He was very respected. He drove the school bus, and he was a deacon. … No one really hated him.”\nThe family was at a loss for who would do something so horrific. Then, in 1988, investigators got a boost from an unlikely source: “Unsolved Mysteries.”\nThat November, the TV series aired a recreation of the Swains’ murder featuring several of the women who’d witnessed the attack and the actual evidence from the crime scene. The episode also broadcast the composite sketch of the so-called killer and soon tips were pouring in again.\nMultiple suspects were considered, alibis checked, but still no arrests were made. For more than a decade, the Swains’ murder case remained cold. That changed in 1998, when the Camden County Sheriff’s Office hired a former deputy and gave him a year to reinvestigate the murders.\nWithin weeks, he’d zeroed in on a suspect: Dennis Perry.\nPerry told CNN he didn’t even realize he was a suspect in the Swains’ murder until cops began knocking on his door more than a decade later.\n“I kept telling him, ‘Y’all got the wrong one. Y’all have the wrong person,’” Perry recalled. “They wanted to arrest somebody … and that’s what they did.”\nOn the day he was arrested, Perry said police pulled him over on his way home from work.\n“I look in my rearview mirror and there’s pistols and shotguns and everything else pointed at me,” he recalled.\n“That day right there is in my mind,” Perry said through tears. “And I’ll never, I’ll never forget it.”\nAlthough he grew up with his grandparents in Camden County, where the murders took place, Perry said back in 1985 he was living with his mother outside metro Atlanta, nearly five hours away from Rising Daughter.\nPerry didn’t own a car at the time, so he caught a ride with his neighbor to work each day. During the initial murder investigation, police confirmed Perry’s alibi with his neighbor and cleared him as a suspect, court records show.\nBut by the time the trial began in 2003, the original investigators had retired and much of evidence that could have helped Perry’s defense team prove his alibi was “lost” or missing from the case file, according to court records.\nThe glasses found at the crime scene had also disappeared, but not before they could be analyzed, and the “Caucasian hairs” tested for DNA.\nThe DNA results from the hair excluded Perry, court records show.\nAnd, the “unusual” glasses were examined by an optometrist, who noted the owner was “extremely far-sighted with an astigmatism in his right eye,” court records show. Perry’s eyes didn’t match the prescription, as a test revealed he had “20/20 vision in each eye and no astigmatism.”\n“If you look at Dennis’ case, it has to make anyone very concerned that Dennis could have been prosecuted and convicted of murder with absolutely no physical evidence linking him to the crime scene,” Susan Clare, an attorney with King & Spalding who worked on Perry’s exoneration team, told CNN.\nInstead of relying on physical evidence, the state built the case against Perry on the testimony of a woman named Jane Beaver – Perry’s ex-girlfriend’s mother.\nAfter the “Unsolved Mysteries” episode aired, Beaver began her own ad hoc investigation into the murders, showing a photo she had of Perry to the women who witnessed the shooting and asking whether he was the White man in the lobby that night.\nDuring the trial, Beaver’s testimony provided a motive and a means for Perry to have committed the murders, court records show. Clare said prosecutors also leaned heavily on the witness’ positive identification of Perry as the man in the lobby – even though Beaver had suggested he was the killer when she showed them his photograph a decade earlier.\nRelated article\nHe spent two decades in prison for church murders. New DNA evidence shows someone else did it\nYears later, attorneys working on Perry’s exoneration learned Beaver received $12,000 to testify, according to court documents. Clare said the state’s key witness being paid was never disclosed to Perry’s legal team – and that knowledge could have changed their entire defense.\nAfter a weeklong trial, Perry was convicted of the murders of Harold and Thelma Swain.\nThe case was originally tried as a capital offense and the state had asked for the death penalty. But Charlie Swain said he and his family agreed they didn’t want to see anyone else killed.\n“Dennis’ mama thanked me for it,” Swain said. “And I’m glad I did because he would have been the wrong person.”\nAfter the verdict, Perry said prosecutors approached him with an offer: He could serve two consecutive life sentences, but he wouldn’t have the option to appeal.\nIn that moment, Perry said he was only sure of one thing: “I wasn’t ready to die yet. So, I said, ‘OK, I’ll take that.’”\nIn all the years she’s known her husband, Brenda said she’s never truly seen him mad. Dennis admits it’s not really in his nature.\nBut that’s OK, Brenda said; she’s willing to be mad enough for the both of them – especially about his conviction.\n“You take somebody out of the midst of society and pick them up and drop them down in a pit of hell – in a prison? – they don’t know what to do, how to survive.”\nBrenda and Dennis got married while he was in prison, and she said she hated the thought of him in there alone. So, she visited Perry every weekend, oftentimes with the grandkids in tow. On one memorable visit, she said their granddaughter pointed up at the barbed wire surrounding the prison.\n“She says, ‘You know, Granny, isn’t it nice of those people to put that barbed wire up there so those bad people can’t get in there to Papa,” she recalled as Perry chuckled. “In her heart of hearts, she really believed they were protecting him.”\nBut the sad truth was life behind bars was hard for Perry. The family always stressed to the kids that “Papa Sunshine” should never have been sent to prison in the first place.\n“They always knew that he was in there for somebody telling a lie,” Brenda said. It took more than two decades for the family to convince the rest of the world of the same thing.\nAlthough he had agreed not to appeal his sentence, Perry said he began writing to the Georgia Innocence Project about his case a few years after he was sent away.\n“I prayed a lot,” Perry said, “hoping that one day, some eyes would be open, some ears would be opened – somebody would hear my case because I knew I didn’t do it.”\nThe Innocence Project took on the case. Years later, in 2018, they brought on Phil Holladay and a team at King & Spalding to help. After meeting Perry for the first time, Holladay said he and Clare were confident he was innocent.\n“I walked in the house and my wife said, ‘Well, how did it go?’ And I said, ‘He didn’t do it,’” Holladay recalled, adding that his wife, who’s also an attorney, was skeptical of his certainty.\n“I said, ‘Dennis is one of the most gentle people I’ve ever met, and he just wouldn’t have it in him.’”\nPerry said he dubbed his legal team his “12 disciples.”\n“They never gave up,” he said, “And I thank God for that.”\nBut the question remained, if Perry didn’t kill the Swains, who did? Over the years, multiple true crime junkies have asked the same. In 2018, the podcast “Undisclosed” dedicated an entire season to reinvestigating the Swains’ murder and Perry’s conviction.\nThe following year, Sharpe, who was an investigative journalist with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, said his interest in the case piqued when he learned about it from the Georgia Innocence Project. It was the first time he’d heard of the murders, he said, even though he grew up down the road.\nSharpe dove into the case and began reexamining the alibis of previous suspects. That included looking into a man named Erik Sparre, whose name had come up early in the investigation into the murders.\n“I decided to give him the same benefit of the doubt that I give everybody else: ‘He’s got an alibi, he must be telling the truth, but I’m going to look into it,’” Sharpe said.\nOn the night of the murders, Sparre said he was working an overnight shift at a local Winn-Dixie grocery store. Sharpe said he began searching for the store’s manager, who police records show had confirmed Sparre’s alibi to investigators.\nEventually, Sharpe said he connected with the manager, who was much older now but  categorical about one thing: He never spoke to the police.\n“He’s like, ‘I never talked to the cops about this, and I would have known if they asked me about this because it was the biggest thing that happened,’” Sharpe told CNN. “’I definitely would have remembered him calling about one of my employees.’”\nWhat’s more, Sharpe said the man told him the personal details listed in the police file – like his name and address – were incorrect. He later gave a sworn statement with the same denial, according to a court document.\nArmed with such an emphatic denial, Sharpe said he continued to do his due diligence by contacting both Sparre and the Georgia Innocence Project for comment. Little did he know his line of questioning would trigger a chain of events that would ultimately lead to Perry’s exoneration.\nChristina Cribbs, a senior attorney with the Georgia Innocence Project, said the team sent an investigator to Sparre’s home and asked his mother to volunteer a DNA sample. She agreed, believing it would potentially help clear her son in the case.\nBecause children inherit their mitochondrial DNA from their mothers, a DNA test can show with a high probability of certainty whether two people are related. This kind of DNA testing has become a critical tool for forensic investigations.\nRelated article\nMan arrested after DNA helps crack cold case killing nearly 40 years later as police link him to another case\n“It just so happened that (Sparre) and his mother’s was a very uncommon (DNA) profile,” Cribbs said. “They were able to compare that to the profile that they had gotten from the hair on the glasses before Dennis’ trial – and it was a match.”\nAccording to court records, the DNA analysis was “able to exclude 99.6%” of the North American population as contributing the hairs found at the crime scene – but Erik Sparre could not be excluded.\nWhen Sharpe called Sparre to discuss the DNA results, he maintained his innocence, as he had in their previous interviews.\nSparre said, “Listen, this DNA is going to prove that I didn’t do that,” Sharpe recalled of the conversation, which was later published in the AJC. “And I said, ‘OK.’ And … you know, it didn’t work out that way.”\nEven if 99.6% of the population could be excluded from the crime based on the hair found at the scene, that still leaves more than a million potential suspects in North America alone.\nBut the DNA evidence was the breakthrough his attorneys needed to prove Dennis Perry could not have been the person wearing the glasses that night.\nPerry’s legal team filed a motion for a new trial in 2019, outlining why this new DNA evidence, coupled with years of other facts they had gathered to demonstrate Perry’s innocence, should be enough to overturn his conviction for the murders of Harold and Thelma Swain.\nAnd a judge agreed. After 20 years, 10 months and six days, Dennis Perry was released from prison in 2020. Nearly a year later, he was exonerated.\nOn December 9 – nearly 40 years after the murders of Harold and Thelma Swain – the Georgia Bureau of Investigation arrested Erik Sparre at his home in Waynesville, Georgia.\nHe was charged with two counts of murder and two counts of aggravated assault, according to a statement from the GBI.\nStephen Tillman, Sparre’s public defender, confirmed his office is handling the case but declined to comment further.\nCNN also reached out to several of Sparre’s relatives, one of whom agreed to an interview, but declined to be identified out of concern for the safety of his family.\nOver the past four years, the allegations surrounding Erik Sparre have taken a toll on their wider family, he said. This was further compounded when Sparre’s mother, Gladys, died due to previous health issues shortly after Perry was exonerated.\nSince Erik Sparre’s arrest earlier this month, his family has struggled to reconcile the allegations with the man they’ve come to know, his relative said.\nThe two had reconnected in recent years after decades of being estranged. Now, he now wonders if it’s something he will come to regret.\n“If I found out that he did do it, I would be upset that I’ve ever allowed him into my life,” the relative said.\n“My big fear is that the GBI has a black eye from imprisoning the wrong guy for 20 years, and they’re not going to let that happen again. I guess that kind of makes me wonder what they got, what they know.”\nPerry’s exoneration has also opened old wounds for the Swain family, who thought they’d found some semblance of closure.\n“After they found that Dennis didn’t do it, it even hurt worse because – who did?” Charlie Swain said. Now, with Sparre’s arrest and the prospect of another trial, Swain and his sister said they hope they will finally have answers.\n“We just pray and hope that we will find closure in this lifetime,” he said.\nAs a wrongfully convicted man, Dennis Perry takes the idea that you’re innocent until proven guilty to heart and he declined to discuss Sparre’s arrest. The 62-year-old is far more focused on soaking up every moment with his family and grandbabies. The 4-year-old, he proudly says, recently learned how to steer a golf cart.\nGeorgia is one of a dozen states that does not automatically compensate exonerees. The Georgia state legislature passed a bill in 2022 to compensate Perry for the decades he spent in prison.\nBut at night, when his guard is down, the memories of all he witnessed and experienced during those decades in prison resurface. At least twice a week, Brenda says, he wakes up in a sweat.\n“You don’t unsee the things you saw, and you can’t unhear the things you heard,” she said sagely. Perry agrees.\nThe family still lives in Camden County, less than 10 miles away from Rising Daughter Baptist Church. When he first got home, Perry said he couldn’t bring himself to even drive near the church and he was scared to venture into town by himself.\nNow, Perry says he’s proudly embracing his life, bolstered by a profound appreciation for freedom. His license tag reads exonerated.\n“They got to read it, and if they run it, it says his name,” Brenda quips. Perry just laughs.\nCNN’s Christina Zdanowicz contributed to this report.\n",

    "publishedAt": "8:00 AM EST, Wed December 25, 2024",
    "content": "Like millions of American teens, Kailey Corum is savvy about the dangers of TikTok — but she’s also wary about government efforts to shut it down.\nThe Virginia high school student uses the platform to catch up on news, listen to music and discover cooking tips. She chooses her words carefully when describing whether she trusts the Supreme Court to decide the fate of an app that 17% of teenagers report using “almost constantly.”\n“I don’t put, exactly, full faith into it,” said Corum, a junior, as she stood outside the Supreme Court after a recent tour of the building with her classmates. “But there’s not much personally I can do.”\nIn the coming months, the Supreme Court will decide a series of blockbuster cases that could significantly transform the lives of the nation’s teenagers — potentially limiting access to vaping products, upholding a ban on transgender care for minors and deciding whether the controversial TikTok law can be squared with the First Amendment.\nThe appeals have made their way to the justices — including two who still have teenage children — at a moment when lawmakers are engaging in fierce culture war fights over school book bans, transgender student athletes and the teaching of American history – prompting a flood of litigation that is already working its way through federal courts.\nThe disputes are heating up even as there are signs that young people are especially disillusioned with Washington generally and the Supreme Court specifically. A Marquette Law School poll last week found the high court’s approval among Americans 18-29 stands at 44%, lower than any other age category.\n“It does feel like the biggest cases are ones that will directly implicate children’s interests,” said Aaron Tang, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, who specializes in education law. “I don’t think we should be surprised that more and more cases are going to get to the court directly implicating young people when so many state and local lawmakers are legislating with morality and young people on their minds.”\nThe Supreme Court added to its “teenager term” on Wednesday by agreeing to hear arguments in the fast-moving challenge to the widely bipartisan TikTok ban President Joe Biden signed in April. The law followed years of concern that TikTok’s Chinese parent company poses a national security risk. It would allow TikTok to continue to operate in the US if its US-based subsidiary makes a clean break from Chinese ownership.\nPediatricians and other experts have for years warned about the potential harms of social media for teenagers, but it was national security — not social science — that ostensibly prompted Congress to approve the TikTok ban. Because of that, the questions now pending at the Supreme Court don’t deal with how young people interact with the app, even though they will be most affected by the court’s decision.\nThe ban is set to take effect January 19.\n“The court, I don’t think, is thinking of this in terms of children,” said Leslie Y. Garfield Tenzer, a law professor at Pace University who focuses on social media.\n“We all think of TikTok as being essential to teens and content creation — and Ariana Grande doing the ‘Wicked’ dance and everyone mimicking it — but the reason that the ban is in place is not because of that type of content,” Tenzer said. “It’s because of the fear that the People’s Republic of China can manipulate us.”\nThat disconnect between the legal questions raised in the case and the potential impact on young people and their parents is a theme that runs through several of the major cases this term. A majority of the court’s justices signaled this month they are prepared to back a divisive Tennessee law that bans gender-affirming care for minors. Much of that argument on December 4 focused on whether courts should defer to state lawmakers in making those difficult choices. Far less time was spent on the transgender minors who have described the care as essential.\nThe court notably declined to consider a question about whether parents have a right to direct care for their children.\nA case pending about the Food and Drug Administration’s effort to yank vaping products from shelves, meanwhile, has less to do with the health risks for youth than with whether the agency followed the proper legal protocols when it stepped in to regulate the multibillion-dollar industry. Nineteen percent of high school students vaped in 2020, the FDA says, a far higher share than that of students who smoked.\nAt the center of both disputes are questions about whether state lawmakers and agencies overstepped when they enacted policies they say are necessary to protect young people. At least one conservative — Justice Clarence Thomas — appeared potentially persuaded by Tennessee’s argument that its transgender care ban applies to people based on age rather that sex and on their medical choices — a distinction that would make it easier for the state to defend the law in federal court.\n“So why isn’t this simply a case of age classification when it comes to these treatments as opposed to a ban?” Thomas asked the attorney for the Biden administration.\nTexas is making similar arguments in a case the court is set to hear next month concerning a state law that requires age verification for sexually explicit web sites. Opponents, including the porn industry, say the law violates the First Amendment by making it harder for adults to access adult content online. But supporters say the law is first and foremost about safeguarding minors.\n“Texas seeks to protect kids from some of the most prurient sexual content imaginable,” attorneys for the state wrote in court papers. “Texas has addressed only websites dedicated to pornography, has allowed them to comply by using common age-verification technology, and has not imposed criminal penalties. Such a modest but important law satisfies any level of scrutiny.”\nBecause of the way lawsuits move through the federal judiciary, the Supreme Court is limited in how it frames its cases and who is heard. While the justices did not grant a separate appeal from the transgender minors and their families affected by Tennessee’s ban, the court did allow their attorney to present arguments earlier this month.\nStill, experts say the cases that will affect teenagers that are now pending give attention to young people only secondarily.\n“The court isn’t directly evaluating what it thinks will be best for young people,” Tang said. “The court is evaluating whether state lawmakers — or the FDA, in the vaping case — were correct in their assessment of what would be best for young people.”\nThat worries advocates who work with teenagers, who fear that some of the most contentious fights playing out in Congress and statehouses across the country are more about politics than they are about protecting minors. A Gallup-Walton Family Foundation survey from earlier this year found that 44% of voting-age members of Gen Z said they trust the Supreme Court “very little,” while 20% said they had “quite a lot” or “a great deal” of trust in the court.\n“What we have heard from them is an increase in distrust and an increase in disillusionment with government institutions,” said Diana Thu-Thao Rhodes, a vice president at Advocates for Youth, a reproductive and sexual rights organization.\n“The impact is directly on young people,” she said, “and yet we don’t necessarily hear the voices of young people.”\nSpencer Rahim, also a high school junior from Virginia, said that most teenagers he knows manage to find ways around the concerns many have about TikTok. Some, for instance, simply avoid posting personal material.\n“To me,” he said, “it’s not really that big of a concern.”\nLess certain for Rahim, however, is how the justices will tackle the issue.\n“They need to listen to the people a little bit more,” he said.\n",

    "content": "Twenty years ago on December 26, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake triggered massive tsunamis across the Indian Ocean, sending waves slamming into the coasts of 14 countries with devastating power.\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami was one of the deadliest disasters in modern recorded history, killing an estimated 230,000 people and affecting millions.\nThe initial earthquake struck off the western coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, on the morning of Boxing Day. Whole towns and villages were swept away as thousands of miles of coastline was destroyed in Indonesia, India, Thailand, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Seychelles and Somalia.\nThe scale of the tragedy was magnified by its sudden onslaught.\nThe lack of an early-warning system and minimal sea-level data left seismologists scrambling to determine the earthquake’s magnitude and exactly if – and where – the waves would hit.\nMany were left without warning, and little time to escape. Others had no idea what was happening as the ocean withdrew, exposing the seafloor - a natural warning sign of a possible tsunami approaching.\nIndonesia’s Aceh province, which was closest to the epicenter, was the worst hit with an estimated 130,700 people killed and 565,384 internally displaced, while 199,766 houses were destroyed or damaged.\nThe horror of the tsunami endures two decades later with communities that have since rebuilt and families who lost loved ones still bearing the scars.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration called the tragedy a “wake-up call” and has since ramped up investment in tsunami science and the deployment of buoys used in tsunami monitoring systems to detect seismic events quicker and more accurately.\n",

    "content": "With three seconds left on the clock, the score knotted up at 58 — the fifth tie of the fourth quarter — Notre Dame had the ball and a chance to win its first women’s basketball title.\nThe inbound went to Arike Ogunbowale, who muscled through the defense, dribbled twice as she moved down the sideline, and hoisted and sunk a three-pointer to seal the game against Mississippi State on April 1, 2018.\nTucked in a corner of a sports bar in Portland, Oregon, Jenny Nguyen and her friends erupted in joy and slapped high-fives while the rest of the patrons looked over in confusion.\nAll the theatrics from the NCAA women’s basketball championship game took place on a TV with no sound. The other two-dozen-plus TVs in the bar were tuned to regular season men’s baseball and basketball games.\nWatching those dramatic games with no sound was among a long list of challenges in watching women’s sports at bars. But this time, it served as a tipping point for Nguyen and ended up launching an entire movement.\n“I was frustrated with the situation, and I blurted out, ‘The only way we’re ever going to experience women’s sports in the way it should be is if we had our own place,’” she said.\nFour years later, in April 2022, Nguyen did just that: She opened The Sports Bra, thought to be the world’s first bar that exclusively airs women’s sports.\nGetting The Sports Bra off the ground wasn’t easy. There were vocal naysayers who said the venture was doomed to fail, claiming “nobody watches women’s sports.” Plus, funding was hard to come by as banks tightened up their lending during the Covid-19 pandemic and Nguyen was an unemployed chef and unproven entrepreneur.\nSo she emptied out her savings account and turned to Kickstarter on Valentine’s Day in 2022. The Sports Bra hit its goal of $48,700 eight days later and ultimately ended up raising upward of $105,000.\nEight months after opening, The Sports Bra surpassed $1 million in sales.\nThe concept has not only inspired other entrepreneurs to open women’s sports bars of their own, but also The Sports Bra is set to become a national franchise, helped by an investment from Alexis Ohanian, the Reddit co-founder and Serena Williams’ husband.\n“Sports bars have been around for 40-plus years, and it feels like they haven’t changed much,” Nguyen told CNN. “And they were really built for 50% of the population or less. We (women’s sports fans) weren’t in mind for celebrating fandom of sports.”\nBasketball was Nguyen’s No. 1 love. The Portland native grew up watching the Portland Trail Blazers in their heyday, cutting the athletes’ pictures out of magazines and hanging them on her bedroom walls.\nNaturally athletic, she took right to the game as well.\n“I really didn’t want to play anything else,” she said. “My dad loves soccer. He grew up playing soccer in Vietnam, so he tried to push me in that direction. But literally every time a ball came near me, I would pick it up and want to dribble it.”\n“Jenny the Basketball Player” quickly became her moniker in the schoolyard, and that followed her to middle school, to high school and to college. She met most of her friends through basketball, and, as such, most of their social excursions took place at a sports bar.\n“And we really only ever wanted to watch women’s basketball,” she said.\nAnd, typically, it was a chore.\nBarkeeps frequently balked at changing channels to a women’s game, even if TVs were plentiful. Landing a women’s game with sound was a major feat.\nAnd, unfortunately, the visits often came with harassment: Other patrons would make them feel unwelcome or unsafe.\n“I thought maybe it was just my situation here, looking the way I do and feeling the way I do,” she said. “But after we opened The Sports Bra, it became clear that folks all over the place were having similar experiences to ours here.”\n“The Bra” may exclusively show women’s sports, but its patrons are all ages, all genders.\n“So many folks who come into the Bra, they will tell me that it never occurred to them that this was needed,” Nguyen said. “When guys come in here, they say things like, ‘Wow, it never occurred to me that when I walk into a sports bar, it’s always men’s sports.’”\nThe Sports Bra’s emergence and success comes as women’s sports are also in the midst of a renaissance.\nRecords are being shattered for viewership, attendance and sponsorships; new professional leagues in hockey, basketball and baseball are getting off the ground; existing leagues are expanding with new teams, including a WNBA team in Portland that will debut in 2026; and athletes’ pay is improving.\nAnd perhaps most importantly, those games and events are more readily available to watch and stream.\nWomen’s sports coverage on TV has long been overwhelmingly overshadowed by coverage of men’s sports, said Cheryl Cooky, a professor of American studies and women’s, gender and sexuality studies at Purdue University.\nCooky has researched gender, sports, media and culture for more than 35 years, notably via a longitudinal study that started in 1989 and is updated every five years tracking televised coverage of women’s and men’s sports.\nAs of 2019 (this year’s data is due out in 2025), women’s sports coverage on TV remained a small fraction of the coverage of men’s sports, with a mere 5.1% of TV sports news airtime devoted to women’s sports. Airtime peaked at 8.7% in 1999, when women’s soccer fandom reached a fever pitch during the World Cup.\nCooky anticipates that the coverage share picked up this year as athletes such as gymnast Simone Biles, tennis player Coco Gauff, and basketball players A’ja Wilson, Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese made history in their respective sports and helped drive visibility for all female athletes in the process.\n“The legacy media can no longer dismiss the interest in women’s sports, because the interest is so much more visible now than it has been in the past,” Cooky said. “Fans can follow teams and leagues and athletes on social media and podcasts. We do have more visibility, more coverage, more content than we have in the past.”\nA Bar of Their Own, a women’s sports bar that opened this year in Minneapolis, subscribes to about 15 different streaming services and is frequently on the horn with providers to secure commercial streaming rights, founder Jillian Hiscock told CNN.\n“We have to make it easier for people to be a women’s sports fan,” she said.\nIt is improving, as Hiscock has witnessed in the nine months the bar’s been open. Earlier this month, ESPN carried the UConn and Notre Dame women’s basketball game, which ultimately set season-high viewership ratings for women’s college basketball.\n“We’ve seen national championship games being played on ABC or NBC, so people don’t have to have additional subscriptions in order to watch some of these games,” she said. “As for the viewership records being broken, I want to say, ‘Yeah, it’s because we’re showing it.’ This is what happens when you show women’s sports — people watch it.”\nWhile that message hasn’t gotten through in the past, Hiscock said she feels like the momentum now is unmistakable. Not only are games being carried on major networks and more women’s sports bars are popping up across the country, but traditional sports bars are showing more women’s games as well, she said.\nAnd Nguyen, who inspired A Bar of Their Own, played a critical role in fueling that expansion, Hiscock said.\n“We’ve absolutely shown that there is the demand, and we simply don’t have the supply for all the demand in our space,” Hiscock said. “That was one of the first things (Nguyen) said to me was that it’s always been about more eyes on women’s sports.”\n“She really was that trailblazer in pushing that message that has benefited all of us that have come after her and continue to benefit those that come after us,” Hiscock added.\nAs The Sports Bra’s brand continues to have more weight, that’s led to other revenue-generators such as merchandise sales, sponsorships, business partnerships, analytics and, now, franchising.\nNguyen told CNN that there’s been “overwhelmingly positive” interest from potential franchisees and that The Sports Bra is in the process of “thoughtfully and carefully selecting folks and cities” to join the company in its next stage of growth.\nIn an April video announcing his investment, Ohanian said, “You look at all these sports now, there’s undeniable excellence coming from women.… Every bar I ever walked into was only showing exclusively men’s sports.”\nNguyen sees far more to come.\n“You know how you write a business plan, and at the end, they ask where you see your business in five years, 10 years, 25 years? I wrote that I’d love it if the Bra was in maybe a dozen metropolitan cities across the US,” she said. “That was my biggest dream, and that maybe we would do collaborations with Nike or work with local sports teams.”\n“Clearly, I didn’t dream big enough,” she added.\n",

BYD said then that it had cut ties with the firm that hired the workers and was working with authorities.\n“Being unjustly labeled as ‘enslaved’ has made our employees feel that their dignity has been insulted and their human rights violated, seriously hurting the dignity of the Chinese people. We have signed a joint letter to express our true feelings,” Jinjiang said on its official Weibo account.\nTheir statement was reposted by Li Yunfei, general manager of branding and public relations at BYD, on his own Weibo account. He accused “foreign forces” and some Chinese media of “deliberately smearing Chinese brands and the country, and undermining the relationship between China and Brazil.”\nA BYD representative directed Reuters to Li’s Weibo post when asked about Jinjiang’s comments and the situation. Jinjiang did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.\nOn Wednesday, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the Chinese embassy in Brazil was communicating with Brazilian counterparts to verify the situation and handle it.\nBYD has been building the factory with an annual capacity of producing 150,000 cars initially in Brazil, the Chinese EV giant’s largest overseas market, as part of plans to start production there in 2024 or early 2025.\nRelated article\nChinese EV maker BYD’s revenue beats Tesla for first time\nBrazil is poised to hike tariffs on imported EVs to 35% in July 2026 from 18% currently.\nJinjiang said there had been translation and cultural difference issues that had led to the situation and that questions from the Brazilian inspectors had been “suggestive.” It also posted a video showing a group of Chinese workers in front of the camera with one of them reading out a letter that Jinjiang said the workers have jointly signed.\nThe letter said, for instance, that 107 workers had handed their passports to the company for help with applying for a temporary ID certificate in Brazil. The Brazilian labor inspectors had said that the workers had had their passports withheld by the company.\n“We are very happy to come to Camacari to work,” an unidentified Chinese male said in the video.\n“We have been complying with laws and regulations, working hard during the period with a hope that the construction of the biggest new energy vehicle project in Brazil could be completed as soon as possible,” he added.\n",

    "content": "Russia launched an “inhumane” attack on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure on Christmas Day, with explosions reported across the country, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said.\nIt is the thirteenth time this year Russia has carried out a major attack on Ukraine’s power grid, according to DTEK, the country’s largest energy provider, leaving it in a precarious position while the war grinds into a third winter.\nAt least one person died in the attacks in the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region, while six others were injured in Kharkiv – less than 20 miles from the Russian border – Ukraine’s national police said, adding that residential buildings and civilian infrastructure were damaged in the attack. At least seven missile strikes targeted the city, regional governor Oleh Syniehubov said.\nHalf a million households have been left without heating in the Kharkiv region in temperatures of 3 degrees Celsius (37 degrees Fahrenheit). Kyiv has imposed rolling blackouts to stabilize the grid, DTEK said.\nUkrainian forces meanwhile said Wednesday that they attacked a Russian command post overnight in Lgov in the Kursk region, where Kyiv launched a surprise offensive this year.\nFour people were killed and five have been hospitalised, including one woman in a serious condition, according to local authorities in the Kursk region.\nIn Russia’s North Ossetia-Alania, the ministry of defence said an explosion and fire in a shopping center in Vladikavkaz was caused by falling debris from a drone shot down by air defence forces Wednesday morning which killed one person.\nPrior to 2023, most Ukrainians celebrated Christmas on January 7 under the Julian church calendar, but last year Zelensky signed a law formally changing the date as a way of further distancing the country from the traditions of the Russian Orthodox Church – and bringing it in line with much of the rest of Europe.\nUkraine created its own independent Orthodox Church of Ukraine in 2018, splitting from the Moscow-affiliated Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC). Since then, religious affiliation has increasingly been viewed as a symbol of national loyalty.\nThe holiday is now celebrated by Ukrainian Orthodox Christians on December 25, and Zelensky said Russia’s intentions were clear.\n“Every massive Russian strike requires time for preparation. It is never a spontaneous decision. It is a deliberate choice – not only of targets but also of timing and date,” Zelensky said.\n“Today, Putin deliberately chose Christmas for an attack. What could be more inhumane?”\nRussia launched more than 70 missiles on Wednesday, including ballistic missiles, and more than 100 attack drones targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, he said, adding more than 50 missiles were shot down along with a “significant” number of drones.\n“Unfortunately, there are hits. As of now, there are blackouts in several regions,” he added.\nDTEK said the attacks severely damaged equipment at its thermal power plants across the country.\n“This year, it is the thirteenth massive attack on the Ukrainian energy sector and the tenth massive attack on the company’s energy facilities,” the company said, adding its thermal power plants have been shelled more than 200 times since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.\nRussia attacked “the energy sector again on a massive scale,” Ukraine’s energy minister German Halushchenko said on his Facebook page. Ukraine’s energy operator imposed emergency blackouts in several parts of the country, the minister added.\nUkraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha said on X that a Russian missile passed Moldovan and Romanian airspace “reminding that Russia threatens not only Ukraine.”\nMaia Sandu, president of the Republic of Moldova said on X: “While our countries celebrate Christmas, Kremlin chooses destruction – targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and violating Moldova’s airspace with a missile, actions that clearly violate international law. Moldova condemns these acts and stands in full solidarity with Ukraine.”\nRomanian’s ministry of national defense said they could not confirm that Romanian airspace was crossed.\nPoland scrambled fighter jets in response to a Russian missile threat in western Ukraine, according to the Polish Operational Command.\nWednesday’s attack follows a deadly Russian strike on the city of Kryvyi Rih on Christmas Eve. At least one person was killed and 17 others were injured after a Russian missile struck a residential building in the city – the hometown of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n",

    "content": "Imagine, if you will, the most glorious festive feast, with an oversize turkey, stuffing two ways, holiday ham, the requisite fixings and at least half a dozen pies and cakes. That may all sound grand — that is, until you consider the extravagant displays of the ancient Roman banquet.\nMembers of the Roman upper classes regularly indulged in lavish, hours-long feasts that served to broadcast their wealth and status in ways that eclipse our notions of a resplendent meal. “Eating was the supreme act of civilization and celebration of life,” said Alberto Jori, professor of ancient philosophy at the University of Ferrara in Italy.\nAncient Romans enjoyed sweet and salty concoctions. Lagane, a rustic short pasta usually served with chickpeas, was also used to make a honey cake with fresh ricotta cheese. The Romans used garum, a pungent, salty fermented fish sauce for umami flavor in all dishes, even as a dessert topping. (For context, garum has a similar flavor profile and composition to current-day Asian fish sauces such as Vietnam’s nuoc mam and Thailand’s nam pla.) The prized condiment was made by leaving fish meat, blood and guts to ferment inside containers under the Mediterranean sun.\nGame meat such as venison, wild boar, rabbit and pheasant along with seafood like raw oysters, shellfish and lobster were just some of the pricey foods that made regular appearances at the Roman banquet.\nWhat’s more, hosts played a game of one-upmanship by serving over-the-top, exotic dishes like parrot tongue stew and stuffed dormouse. “Dormouse was a delicacy that farmers fattened up for months inside pots and then sold at markets,” Jori said. “While huge quantities of parrots were killed to have enough tongues to make fricassee.”\nGiorgio Franchetti, a food historian and scholar of ancient Roman history, recovered lost recipes from these repasts, which he shares in “Dining With the Ancient Romans,” written with “archaeo-cook” Cristina Conte. Together, the duo organize dining experiences at archaeological sites in Italy that give guests a taste of what eating like a Roman noble was all about. These cultural tours also delve into the eyebrow-raising rituals that accompanied these meals.\nAmong the unusual recipes prepared by Conte is salsum sine salso, invented by the famed Roman gourmand Marcus Gavius Apicius. It was an “eating joke” made to amaze and fool guests. The fish would be presented with head and tail, but the inside was stuffed with cow liver. Clever sleight of hand, combined with shock factor, counted for a lot in these competitive displays.\nGorging for hours on end also called for what we would consider untoward social behavior in order to accommodate such gluttonous indulgences.\n“They had bizarre culinary habits that don’t sit well with modern etiquette, such as eating while lying down and vomiting between courses,” Franchetti said.\nThis 2,300-year-old mosaic made of shells and coral has just been found buried under Rome\nThese practices helped keep the good times rolling. “Given banquets were a status symbol and lasted for hours deep into the night, vomiting was a common practice needed to make room in the stomach for more food. The ancient Romans were hedonists, pursuing life’s pleasures,” said Jori, who is also an author of several books on Rome’s culinary culture.\nIt was, in fact, customary to leave the table to vomit in a room close to the dining hall. By using a feather, revelers would tickle the back of their throats to stimulate the urge to regurgitate, Jori said. In keeping with their high social status, defined by not having to engage in manual labor, guests would simply return to the banquet hall while slaves cleaned up their mess.\nGaius Petronius Arbiter’s literary masterpiece “The Satyricon” captures this typical social dynamic of Roman society in mid first century AD with the character of wealthy Trimalchio, who tells a slave to bring him a “piss pot” so he can urinate. In other words, when nature called, revelers didn’t necessarily go to the bathroom; often the WC came to them, powered again by slave labor.\nIt was also considered normal to break wind while eating, because it was believed that trapping gas inside the bowels could cause death, Jori said. Emperor Claudius, who reigned from 41 AD to 54 AD, is said to have even issued an edict to encourage flatulence at the table, based on writings in the “Life of Claudius” by Roman historian Suetonius.\nBloating was reduced by eating lying down on a comfortable, cushioned chaise longue. The horizontal position was believed to aid digestion – and it was the utmost expression of an elite standing.\n“The Romans actually ate lying on their bellies so the body weight was evenly spread out and helped them relax. The left hand held up their head while the right one picked up the morsels placed on the table, bringing them to the mouth. So they ate with their hands and the food had to be already cut by slaves,” Jori said.\nFood leftovers and meat and fish bones were thrown on the floor by guests. To get a sense of the scene, consider one mosaic found in a Roman villa in Aquileia, which depicts fish and food leftovers scattered on the floor. The Romans liked to decorate banquet hall floors with such images in order to camouflage real food strewn on the floor. This trompe-l’oeil tactic, or the “unswept floor” effect, was a clever mosaic technique.\nLying down also allowed feast goers to occasionally doze off and enjoy a quick nap between courses, giving their stomach a break.\nThe act of reclining while dining, however, was a privilege reserved for men only. A woman either ate at another table or knelt or sat down beside her husband while he enjoyed his meal.\nAn ancient Roman fresco of a banquet scene at Casa dei Casti Amanti in Pompeii, for example, depicts a man reclining while two women kneel on either side of him. One of the women tends to the man by helping him hold a horn-shaped drinking vessel called a rhyton. Another fresco from Herculaneum, displayed at Naples’ National Archaeological Museum, depicts a woman seated close to a man who is lying down while also raising a rhyton.\n“Men’s horizontal eating position was a symbol of dominance over women. Roman women established the right to eat with their husbands at a much later stage in the history of ancient Rome; it was their first social conquest and victory against sexual discrimination,” Jori explained.\nThe Romans were also very superstitious. Anything that fell from the table belonged to the afterworld and was not to be retrieved for fear that the dead would come seek vengeance, while spilling salt was a bad omen, Franchetti said. Bread had to be solely touched with the hands and eggshells and mollusks had to be cracked. Were a rooster to sing at an unusual hour, servants were sent to fetch one, kill it and serve it pronto.\nFeasting was a way to keep death at bay, according to Franchetti. Banquets ended with a binge-drinking ritual during which diners discussed death to remind themselves to fully live and enjoy life — in short, carpe diem.\nIn keeping with this world view, table objects, such as salt and pepper holders, were shaped as skulls. According to Jori, it was customary to invite beloved dead ones to the meal and serve them platefuls of food. Sculptures representing the dead sat at the table with the living.\nWine wasn’t always drunk straight but spiked with other ingredients. Water was used to dilute the alcohol potency and allow revelers to drink more, while seawater was added so that the salt preserved wine barrels coming from faraway corners of the empire.\n“Even tar was a common substance mixed with the wine, which over time blended with the alcohol. The Romans could hardly taste the nasty flavor,” Jori said.\n‘Lost’ ancient Roman palace reopens after 50 years of neglect\nPerhaps in the ultimate symbol of excess, the epicure Apicius allegedly committed suicide because he had gone broke after throwing too many lavish banquets. He left behind, however, a gastronomic legacy, including his famous Apicius pie made with a mix of fish and meat such as bird interiors and pig’s breasts. A dish that might struggle to entice at modern feasting tables today.\nThis article was first published in November 2020.\n",

    "content": "Editor’s Note: Examining clothes through the ages, Dress Codes is a new series investigating how the rules of fashion have influenced different cultural arenas — and your closet.\nRed velvet suit, white fur trim, tall black boots, cozy (if not indulgent) pom-pom hat. Santa Claus’ uniform may have some variations, from Tim Allen’s off-duty outfits in “The Santa Clause” as he slowly transforms into the legendary gift-giver, to The Plastics’ spaghetti-strap-dress versions in “Mean Girls,” but his signature look is ingrained in pop culture and popular imagination older than anyone living today.\nHis dress codes ensure uniformity across mall Santas around the US, with aspects that are seemingly non-negotiable, despite the fact that he’s — spoiler alert — not real. A Santa Claus wearing a dark green suit at Bloomingdale’s for the department store’s “Wicked” partnership made tabloid headlines as the latest attempt to spark holiday outrage. One mom told the New York Post of the promotion: “Not everything needs to be changed or challenged… Green Santa is stupid. Hard pass.”\nBut Santa didn’t always wear red, and in fact, his outfits, appearance and height took nearly a century to become the iconic character we recognize today. His predecessors include the early Christian bishop St. Nicholas and his Dutch equivalent Sinterklaas; the hooded French patriarch Père Noël; and the German gift-bestowing baby Jesus, Christkindl (which, stateside, led to the mispronounced nickname Kris Kringle), among many others. But the Americanized Santa first began taking shape in the 1820s and kept evolving through poetry, editorial illustrations and advertisements.\nSanta’s key features — a bearded, fur-wearing man pulled by reindeers on a sleigh — became canon thanks to the Clement Clarke Moore poem “A Visit from St. Nicholas” (also known as “‘Twas the Night Before Christmas”) in 1823, as well as a lesser-credited anonymous poem that preceded it in 1821 that named him “Santeclaus.” But everything else he wore was subject to interpretation.\n“The 19th century was the time in which the arguments about what Santa looked like and what he wore were quite prominent,” said historian Gerry Bowler, author of “Santa Claus: A Biography,” in a phone interview.  “It took about 80 years for American artists to settle on Santa’s outfit. Up to that time you could have put them in any color, in all kinds of robes and variations of it.”\nSome early interpretations of Moore’s vision show the jolly holiday intruder as a small and sly elfish peddler of goods who could more believably fit inside a chimney: An 1864 illustrated version of the poem dresses St. Nicholas, who traditionally wears Bishop garments, in a yellow suit and fur cap, as well as an oil painting in 1837, which shows him in a fur-lined red cape. But others played loose with his look: a P.T. Barnum advertisement from 1850 promoting the singer Jenny Lind shows him as a beardless Revolutionary War-era figure, while a 1902 cover for L. Frank Baum’s “The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus” puts him in a dark frock with animal print fur trim and flamboyant red boots.\nThomas Nast, the Harper’s Weekly cartoonist who gave us donkeys for Democrats and elephants for Republicans, played an instrumental role in envisioning Santa. He first drew him in 1863, during the Civil War, wearing stars and stripes as he handed out presents to Union Army soldiers. But the artist’s but most enduring image from 1881 is a version of him in a buckled red suit, nearly indistinguishable from today — though the political messaging to support military wages has been lost over time, according to the Smithsonian. He was followed by artists Norman Rockwell and J.C. Leyendecker, who routinely drew a wholesome Santa in his now iconic suit for The Saturday Evening Post in the early 20th century.\n“When you’ve got Santa in red and white fur trim on the cover of mass market magazines, it pretty much nails it down,” Bowler said.\nThese artists’ formative drawings are often overshadowed by Coca-Cola’s long-running holiday campaigns, illustrated by Haddon Sundblom, which began in 1931 and have become synonymous with Santa’s look. Red-cheeked and Rubenesque, Sundblom’s version of Santa, originally based on a retired salesman who happened to be the illustrator’s friend, became wildly popular, and endures today.\n“I think most people (believe) that Coke had something to do with the establishment of Santa’s red and white costume…you certainly see that all over the internet,” Bowler said. “But it’s not true. Santa’s iconic costume had been (determined) decades before.”\nRelated article\nA cozy history of the ugly Christmas sweater\nCoca-Cola wasn’t even the first soft drink to promote Santa in his suit, he added, with White Rock Beverages doing so during World War I, a few years before his first (pre-Sundblom) appearance for Coke.\n“Certainly the (Coca-Cola) ads were ubiquitous — they were huge for years, so any variation on that gets people very upset,” he added.\nSanta’s earliest visionaries may not have picked out his red suit, but they did intend him to be a creature of nostalgia, according to the historian and author Stephen Nissenbaum. In his seminal 1988 book “The Battle for Christmas,” Nissenbaum charts the history of his character and challenged his oft-repeated origins as a natural import of the Netherlands’ St. Nicholas, Sinterklaas.\nInstead, Nissenbaum points to a coterie of “antiquarian-minded New York gentleman” — to which Moore, the New York Historical Society founder John Pintard, and the writer Washington Irving belonged — who intentionally refashioned the Dutch figure in the 1820s as the symbol of a more family-friendly holiday amid rising poverty and crime.\nIn fact, according to Nissenbaum, the traditional precursor to Christmas in New England had been a drunk, rowdy and lascivious month-long celebration during the 17th and early 18th centuries, as a “safety valve” for the poor to “let off steam” in a more controlled manner than social unrest. One popular custom allowed people to enter the homes of the wealthy with the expectation that they would be given the best food and drink as a gesture of goodwill.\nBy Moore’s time, he explains, Christmas was not celebrated in any one unified way. Puritans had tried to quell it, while Evangelicals worked to convert it into a strictly pious occasion on December 25. Others still relished in the long tradition of mischief, leading to noisy, roving holiday street gangs.\n“Not one of these ways of celebrating Christmas bore much resemblance to the holiday that most of us know today… In none of them would we have found the familiar intimate gathering or the giving of Christmas presents to expectant children. Nowhere would we have found Christmas trees; no reindeer, no Santa Claus,” Nissenbaum writes.\nIn this new version of Christmas, children — who, until around this time, were treated more like needy little adults — became the objects of generosity, absolving the well-to-do of the expectation to serve the poor. And Moore’s vision of St. Nicholas, who Nissenbaum argues was given a secular, working class makeover, neutralized the home invader into a visitor who makes no demands, but instead offers gifts.\nAs his clothes evolved, Santa Claus’ elfish nature faded, too, into a much taller, jolly, and purely benevolent guest.\n“It’s a very unthreatening look, but it is alien,” Bowler noted of his outfit. “He is a creature of fantasy, of imagination, and he wears what nobody else wears. But over time, it becomes familiar.”\nRelated article\nDress Codes: How did plaid become popular for school uniforms?\nBowler believes many of the features that won out over popular imagination were practical choices: Once it’s decided he’s from the Arctic, fur follows; red is vivid and contrasts against both his white beard and the white snow.\nBut tracing Santa’s exact style influences can get murky, since he has so many analogs in different parts of the world, some of whom have simply combined into this singular Westernized image. His hat alone has been credited to the ancient floppy Phrygian cap, felt pileus, and papal fur-trimmed camauro, among many others, but is now distinctly his own, and an irreplaceable part of his identity.\nWith such a varied fashion history, Santa’s closet used to be much bigger. Perhaps there’s room in the future to expand it once again — without the Christmas traditionalists melting down.\n",

    "content": "A woman who alleges she was sexually assaulted by Sean “Diddy” Combs has amended her lawsuit to include allegations that she was also assaulted by Jay-Z at the same party.\nThe lawsuit was initially filed against Combs in October, but on Sunday the woman added Shawn Carter, the rapper and businessman known as Jay-Z, as a defendant in the civil lawsuit.\nCarter is the first celebrity to be accused of sexual assault in connection to Combs.\nIn a statement addressed to CNN, Carter called the allegations “so heinous in nature that I implore you to file a criminal complaint, not a civil one!! Whomever would commit such a crime against a minor should be locked away, would you not agree?”\nCombs was indicted in September on charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and prostitution related charges. He pleaded not guilty to the charges and has denied all wrongdoing in roughly 30 civil lawsuits that have been filed against him.\nThe woman, who is identified as a Jane Doe, says she was 13 years old at the time she was allegedly assaulted by Combs and Carter at an after party following the Video Music Awards in 2000. The woman alleges she began to feel woozy after consuming a drink at the party and wandered into a nearby bedroom. The woman alleges Carter raped her first, followed by Combs. The woman says she hit Combs and ran out of the party, according to the amended lawsuit.\nCarter was identified in the initial lawsuit as Celebrity A.\nNews of the lawsuit was first reported by NBC.\nAccording to the lawsuit, Doe’s attorneys reached out to Carter to request “a mediation to resolve this matter.”\n“Upon present information and belief, Jay-Z responded to said letter by not only filing an utterly frivolous lawsuit, but by also orchestrating a conspiracy of harassment, bullying and intimidation against Plaintiff’s lawyers, their families, employees and former associates in an attempt to silence Plaintiff from naming Jay-Z herein. This effort was meant to scare Plaintiff and to discredit her counsel. That effort failed. Indeed, Plaintiff chose to file this amendment as a result of the egregious conduct perpetuated by Carter,” according to the lawsuit.\nIn his response sent to CNN on Sunday, which was addressed to Doe’s attorney Tony Buzbee, Carter called the mediation request a “blackmail attempt.” Carter also said this lawyer, “who I have done a bit of research on, seems to have a pattern of these type of theatrics!”\nIn a statement from Houston-based Buzbee, he wrote, “The pleading speaks for itself. This is a very serious matter that will be litigated in court.”\nCarter added in his statement that his “only heartbreak” is for his family: “My wife and I will have to sit our children down, one of whom is at the age where her friends will surely see the press and ask questions about the nature of these claims, and explain the cruelty and greed of people. I mourn yet another loss of innocence. Children should not have to endure such at their young age.”\nCNN has also reached out to Jay-Z’s wife Beyoncé Knowles for comment.\nCNN reported in November that an anonymous male celebrity filed a lawsuit against the Texas attorney representing the Doe, alleging he was the victim of an extortion scheme.\nThe celebrity accused Buzbee and his firm of “shamelessly attempting to extort exorbitant sums from him or else publicly file wildly false horrific allegations against him.”\nAttorneys for the unnamed celebrity claimed further that Buzbee had “threatened to unleash entirely fabricated and salacious allegations of sexual assault” that included “multiple instances of rape of a minor, both male and female” if their client “refuses to comply with their demands.”\nBuzbee denied the extortion claims against him, in an Instagram post in which he wrote that his firm “won’t allow the powerful and their high-dollar lawyers to intimidate or silence sexual assault survivors,” and in a statement to CNN.\n“If you are trying to hide your identity and you claim you did nothing wrong, doesn’t seem very smart to take this approach,” Buzbee told CNN in an email at the time. “We will address it in due course.”\n“I have confidence that with full public disclosure all of this will sort itself out,” Buzbee wrote.\nOn Sunday, Buzbee responded on social media to Carter’s statement, saying that the alleged victim “never demanded a penny from him,” claiming they only sought confidential mediation. Buzbee added, “She is emboldened. I’m very proud of her resolve.”\n",

    "content": "The fall of Bashar al-Assad’s brutal dictatorship seemed a distant prospect two weeks ago. But Syria’s rebels completed a speedy and stunning march to power on Sunday, starting an uncertain new era for the country.\nFor half a century, the Assad family ruled over Syria with an iron fist, with long-documented reports of mass incarceration torture, extra-judicial killings and atrocities against their own people.\nOn Sunday, after 13 years of civil war that fractured the country, the regime came crashing down. Rebel fighters declared Damacus “liberated” in a video statement on state television, sending Syrian President Bashar al-Assad fleeing to Russia.\nMany in the country are hopeful for Syria’s next chapter. But the rebels who stormed into Damascus have a complicated past and offer an unpredictable future.\nIt is an “open question” who is currently running Syria, White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told CNN on Monday, illustrating the caution permeating the watching world.\nHere’s what happened in Syria, what it means, and what might come next.\nAn armed rebel alliance charged across Syria over 11 days, sweeping through major cities and reigniting a conflict that had been largely static since a 2020 ceasefire agreement.\nA new rebel coalition, led by the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) launched a surprise attack and took control of Syria’s largest city Aleppo on November 30, a seismic move that met little resistance from the Syrian army.\nSyrian and Russian jets targeted rebels in Aleppo and Idlib but opposition forces seized a second major city of Hama and quickly advanced on Homs – the gateway to the capital Damascus.\nAs Homs fell, rebels encircled and marched into Damascus. Video showed prisoners being freed from Assad’s notorious detention facilities, rebels and civilians were seen ransacking the presidential palace, with footage revealing his luxurious lifestyle and large car collection.\nAn official source in Russia told CNN the deposed president and his family fled to Moscow and were granted political asylum.\nSyria’s rebel coalition is a new grouping called the “Military Operations Command.” It’s made up of various Islamist and moderate factions who, despite their differences, are united in fighting the Assad regime, ISIS and Iran-backed militias.\nThey’re led by Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, the head of militant group HTS who has a complicated past.\nOnce bedfellows with al Qaeda and an apprentice of the future-ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Al-Jolani has sought to distance his forces from the radical Islamism that his former allies pursued.\nHe announced a split from Al Qaeda in 2016 to create what he said was a Syria-focused anti-regime front with other local factions, called Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (the Front for the Conquest of the Levant), which later changed to Hayat Tahrir Al Sham (HTS), or the Organization for the Liberation of the Levant.\nRelated article\nSyrian rebel leader says goal is to ‘overthrow’ Assad regime\nHTS had been the de facto rulers of Idlib, the northwestern Syrian city from which the recent offensive was launched.\nBut HTS is only one of numerous armed groups operating in Syria. Other groups controlling territory in the country include the Turkey-backed Syrian National Army and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, elements of which Turkey views as a terrorist organization.\nThe United States, Turkey, the United Nations and several other Western nations continue to designate HTS as a terrorist organization, and the US has placed a $10 million bounty on Jolani.\nAs his offensive rapidly gathered pace, Jolani accelerated his own years-long effort to redefine himself as a pragmatic statesman. He gave interviews to Western news organizations, telling CNN his opposition ultimately plans to form a government defined by institutions, and a “council chosen by the people.”\nIt draws parallels with the Taliban, whose rapid return to power in Afghanistan in 2021 was accompanied by a Western-friendly push to appear moderate, forgiving and forward-looking, even as the group implemented a draconian return to Sharia law and a crackdown on the rights of women and minorities.\nThe West is hopeful that HTS will follow through on its promises. But millions of Syrians, including those from minority Christian and other religious communities, remain haunted by a legacy of persecution suffered at the hands of extremist groups like al Qaeda and ISIS.\nAssad is the second generation of an autocratic family dynasty that held power in Syria for more than five decades.\nA former ophthalmologist who studied in London, Assad took power in an unopposed election following the death of his father Hafez al-Assad, who had led the Baath Party since seizing power in 1970.\nLike his father, Assad tolerated little dissent and throughout the 13-year civil war, he and his forces have been accused of severe human rights violations and brutal assaults against civilians, with reports of using starvation as a weapon of war, enforced disappearances and killings, and the deliberate bombing of civilian buildings like schools and hospitals.\nAmong Assad’s worst atrocities was the 2013 sarin gas attack in the city of Ghouta, which killed more than 1,400 people and was labeled a war crime by the then-UN secretary general.\nAssad’s notorious detention facilities were black holes where anyone deemed an opponent of the regime disappeared, with widespread reports of torture and inhumane conditions. In 2017, an Amnesty International report claimed as many as 13,000 people had been hanged from 2011 to 2015 at Saydnaya Prison.\nThe conflict in Syria had remained deadly but largely dormant over the past several years, defined by low-level clashes between the rebels and Assad’s regime rather than dramatic changes in territory and control.\nBut then the rebels seized an opportunity, capitalizing on a weakened government whose key allies are heavily preoccupied with other conflicts.\nRussia’s grinding war in Ukraine since 2022 has sucked in manpower and resources. Unlike in 2014, when Moscow stepped in to save Assad, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s energies – and most of his jets, troops and mercenaries – are elsewhere.\nIran has meanwhile been hamstrung by war with Israel, which has escalated dramatically in the past year. Its main proxy Hezbollah, which also came to Assad’s aid in the past, has been decimated by Israeli attacks and airstrikes.\nRebels used that vacuum to advance in Syria, and their calculation paid off; an offensive that might have led to another months-long eruption in hostilities instead took days, ending with a march into the capital that was met with little resistance.\nThe anti-regime coalition is now disbanding Assad’s military, laying out its vision for a post-Assad Syria.\nBut experts wonder if the next phase will be a new dawn for a people strangled by a brutal autocracy – or whether sectarianism will bring a different type of authoritarian rule.\nUS President Joe Biden described the fall of the Assad regime as an “historic opportunity for the long-suffering people of Syria to build a better future” but cautioned it was also a moment of risk and uncertainty in the region.\nIran’s ambassador to Syria Hossein Akbari warned that the fallout from the collapse of Assad’s regime will be beyond American control and could lead to a conflict involving regional countries and Turkey.\nMany in Syria are celebrating a stunning and unexpected political turn that caught much of the world off guard.\nJolani declared victory for the “entire Islamic nation” on Sunday, in his first public remarks since the coup, which he said “marks a new chapter in the history of the region.”\n“My heart longed for this moment,” added Jolani. “There is not a single household in Syria that the war has not touched.”\nBut the change in power is shrouded by uncertainty, too. It’s unclear what a new governing system in Syria would look like, how it will work given the disparate groups and interests involved, and whether the reordering of power will only lead to further instability.\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin cautioned on Monday that ISIS could attempt to “take advantage” of a power vacuum in the country.\nJolani has gone to great lengths to reassure Christian and Kurdish Syrians as his offensive spread across the country, but HTS has a history of harsh treatment against political enemies, and it is an open question whether his outreach will continue once the eyes of the world have moved elsewhere.\nThe fall of Assad has huge reverberations throughout the region and around the world, too.\nThe development has left Iran weakened and will broadly be celebrated in Israel, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described Assad’s collapse as “a historic day in the history of the Middle East.”\nIsrael will welcome Iran’s sudden loss of influence in Syria. But Netanyahu’s forces have, at the same time, already moved to bolster the country’s border with Syria, a reflection of the trepidation that underpins events of the last few days.\nRelated article\nAssad’s fall is huge blow for Putin, highlighting fragility of his own rule\nIn Russia, where Assad fled to, Putin will also be nursing the effects of Assad’s fall from power. There are obvious military effects – Russia used two bases in Syria to project strength in the Middle East – and potential repercussions for Ukraine, with Putin’s hand weakened in any future negotiations.\nAnd for many of the 14 million Syrians forced to flee their homes since the civil war began, the question is whether they can and will return home – either voluntarily or against their will.\nGermany and Austria paused asylum applications for Syrians within hours of Assad’s regime falling, amid a Europe-wide hardening in sentiment towards asylum seekers, but a European Union spokesperson has said the conditions are not yet met for a safe return.\nCNN’s Sana Noor Huq, Simone McCarthy, Nick Paton Walsh, Sophie Tanno, Nic Robertson, Madalena Araujo, Catherine Nicholls, Mostafa Salem, Lex Harvey, Lucas Lilieholm, Manveena Suri and Adam Renton contributed reporting.\n",

    "content": "Irish actor Barry Keoghan has retaliated against what he describes as “inhumane” online trolling and accused people of intimidating his family.\nIn a lengthy statement published on X on Saturday after deactivating his Instagram account, the “Saltburn” star said he could “only sit and take so much.”\n“My name has been dragged across the internet in ways I usually don’t respond to. I have to respond now because it’s gettin to a place where there are too many lines being crossed. I can no longer let this stuff distract from my family and my work,” he wrote.\nKeoghan, who is known for his Oscar-nominated role in “The Banshees of Inisherin,” grew up in Dublin, Ireland, living in several different foster homes and with his grandmother as his mother was addicted to heroin.\nRelated article\nBarry Keoghan hits back at online trolls over ‘disgusting’ parenting comments\nShe died when he was 12, and his father died when he was 15. Critics have also taken aim at Keoghan’s role as a father to 2-year-old son Brando, whom he shares with an ex-partner.\n“The messages I have received no person should ever have to read them. Absolute lies, hatred, disgusting commentary about my appearance, character, how I am as a parent and every other inhumane thing you can imagine,” said Keoghan.\n“Talking about how I was a heroin baby and how I grew up and dragging my dear mother into it also,” he added.\nKeoghan said people had been “knocking on my grannies door” and “sitting outside my baby boy’s house intimidating them. That’s crossing a line.”\nWhile this latest flare-up came in the wake of the reported end of his relationship with American singer Sabrina Carpenter, this is not the first time Keoghan has raised the issue.\nHe spoke extensively about the damaging impact of online trolling in a wide-ranging interview on “The Louis Theroux Podcast” released in November.\nRelated article\nRingo Starr believes Barry Keoghan is ‘taking drum lessons’ to portray him in biopic\n“People kind of have a judgment on me as a parent,” Keoghan said at the time.\n“I’m like, well until you’ve walked a day in my shoes growing up as a kid, then you can comment… There’s a lot online. If I didn’t have tough skin or the strength I have, I wouldn’t be sitting here,” he added.\n“Of course it’s going to affect me being a father when I had no blueprint to take from.”\n“The more in the public I’ve become, the less I’ve posted about my child, because I don’t think it’s fair to put my child online, there’s sick people out there,” said Keoghan.\n“And because I’ve reined that in, people draw a narrative and go ‘absent father, sh*t deadbeat dad’ and more disgusting things that I wouldn’t even repeat. Just the audacity of some people, man, it sickens me and makes me furious.”\nHe spoke in a similar vein about the trolls who comment on his appearance, “especially on TikTok… people can sit there and make videos and be like ‘I don’t like his face, he looks weird, or he looks evil’ and just pick you apart.”\nCNN’s Issy Ronald contributed to this report.\n",

    "content": "Russian-born American photographer Anastasia Samoylova loves “Barbie.” Not only did she wear a hot pink suit to the opening of her own photography exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in October, she also insisted on taking her teenage son to see Greta Gerwig’s 2023 film — considering it essential feminist viewing. “Is it perfect?

Her 2019 series “Flood Zone” — a nod to the unnervingly bureaucratic label that can often dictate life or death — is a surreal chronicle of an area decaying in real time.\nCracked bubblegum-colored concrete, flooded swimming pools, uprooted palm trees and displaced alligators paint a new, unnerving picture of the climate crisis. Samoylova’s images are a far cry from the visual language of starving polar bears and blazing wildfires that often saturate converage around the environment. “Everything is intertwined,” she said. “That’s why I think isolating climate change as something detached and abstract, and visually associated with melting ice caps, is very dangerous because we’re in the moment right now. Every political decision is going to affect us on this daily basis.”\nRelated video\nPhotographer captures stunning images of ‘rivers of rust’ in Canada\nSamoylova moved to Florida in 2016, where she was struck by the state’s severe weather events and  aging infrastructure. She immediately began to document her new surroundings. Almost eight years on, “Flood Zone” feels more relevant than ever in the aftermath of Hurricane Milton, the Category 3 storm that killed more than a dozen and left more than 2.6 million Floridians without power. Milton was the third hurricane in 2024 to make landfall in the state. But Samoylova doesn’t call herself an environmental photographer. “I’m averse to labels,” she said. “I live in Miami and the choice of medium itself, to me, comes with the responsibility to reflect on our time. Otherwise, why photograph?”\nThe insidious, blink-and-you’ll-miss-it approach to her observational photography is intentional.  Several years of capturing political extremism, gentrification and environmental disintegration has given Samoylova time to think about how to package disastrous messaging. “How do you communicate these very complex subjects and make them relatable?” she asks. “The trickiest part is to not make them off-putting.” Come for the pink sidewalks that characterize the streets of Miami — as many tourists do — and stay for the subsequent feelings of existential dread. It’s a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down, she says. “(Climate change) is stigmatized, and it’s become divisive, at least where I live in the US, especially in Florida. And who knows, it’s likely going to be erased from the conversation again.”\nBut beyond providing a record of Florida in crisis, there’s also a dark poetry to her work — and plenty of space for creative interpretation. Samoylova’s favorite pastime is haunting her own gallery installations, parking herself on a viewing bench or floating between visitors like a “ghost,” and tuning in to how people are reading her pictures. “It’s the best feeling,” she said, “Leaving the work open enough to where people can discuss it on their own terms without supplying too much of a didactic narrative.”\nRelated article\nStriking photographs document environmental decay on world’s largest lake\nOne image in particular is ripe for analysis. In “Gator” (2017),  an alligator floats above the viewer, suspended in murky, acerbic green water. While Samoylova took the photo at a nature reserve, holding the lens close to the gator’s tank, there’s no real context to the animal’s surroundings. It could be anywhere — swimming through a flooded street or lying in wait beneath the surface of a flooded pool. “It’s an allegory,” said Samoylova. “Because they really do end up in people’s pools like that,” she said, adding that it felt like barely a month went by without a report of an alligator attack “But these beasts have been here forever. It’s their native habitat, so we are the ones encroaching, not them.”\nSamoylova sees something “Ballardian” in the alligator photo, which she also chose to front her business card, particularly in relation to the British author J. G. Ballard’s 1962 dystopian novel “The Drowned World” which depicts a post-apocalyptic Earth consumed by water. “(The alligator) is kind of ascending over you, and you’re already on the bottom of that reservoir,” she said. “That’s what it feels like in Florida. I mean we’re sitting here today and it’s 29 degrees (Celsius) (84 degrees Fahrenheit). This is November.”\nThe series — along with Samoylova’s own personal perspective — is not supposed to be pessimistic, however. “I remain, not really an optimist, but hopeful,” she told CNN.\nHer next project, titled “Transformations,” explores that sentiment — focusing primarily on capturing the many climate solutions already being implemented across the globe. Anything counts: From solar panels and green roofing to urban gardens and corporate initiatives.\n“We need a bit of hope,” she said.\n",

    "content": "A musical inspired by viral Olympic breakdancer Raygun was shut down hours before it was due to open on Saturday, after lawyers representing the athlete threatened legal action, the show’s creator said on social media.\nSteph Broadbridge, an Australian comedian who wrote and intended to star in “Raygun: The Musical,” said in a video posted on Instagram that the breakdancer’s “lawyers got in touch with the venue and threatened legal action.”\nIn its debut performance at Sydney venue Kinselas, the parody musical intended to retell the story of Australian breaker Rachael Gunn, widely known as Raygun, whose performance at the Paris Olympics spawned countless memes on social media as well as a backlash against her and the sport itself.\nThe 37-year-old dancer’s routine consisted of moves including a kangaroo hop, a backward roll and various contortions with her body while lying or crawling on the floor. She did not register a single point across her Olympic battles against breakers from the United States, France and Lithuania in August, losing 18-0 in all three rounds.\n“They were worried I was damaging her brand, which I would never do,” said Broadbridge, adding: “They were very concerned that people would think that Rachael Gunn was affiliated with the musical.\n“I want to assure everyone that she will not be part of the show. She’s very welcome to come; I would love for her to see it.”\nRelated article\nRaygun apologizes to breakdance community for backlash to her Paris Olympic performance\nBroadbridge said that anyone who had bought a ticket would be refunded their 10 Australian dollars ($6.45). The proceeds from the event were originally intended to be donated to the Women’s and Girls Emergency Centre – a charity that supports women and children affected by homelessness, domestic violence and systemic disadvantage.\nShe added that Gunn’s lawyers trademarked the musical’s poster, which featured a silhouette of the breakdancer’s famous kangaroo hop and said she couldn’t perform that dance as Gunn “owns” it.\n“That one did puzzle me – I mean, that’s an Olympic-level dance. How would I possibly be able to do that without any formal breakdancing training?” Broadbridge said.\nThe musical was advertised as including songs like “You May Be a B-girl But You’ll Always Be an A-girl To Me,” “I’m Breaking Down,” and “I Would Have Won But I Pulled a Muscle,” according to its Eventbrite listing. That listing now says the show is called “Breaking: The Musical.”\nCNN has contacted Gunn’s management team at the agency Born Bred for comment. In a statement to CNN affiliate 7news, the agency said that “Gunn’s management and legal team is committed to protecting her intellectual property and ensuring that her brand remains strong and respected.”\n“While we have immense respect for the credible work and effort that has gone into the development of the show, we must take necessary steps to safeguard Rachael’s creative rights and the integrity of her work,” it said.\n“This action is not intended to diminish the contributions of others, but rather to ensure her brand is properly represented and protected in all future endeavours.”\nAfter the furor, Broadbridge apologized to Gunn for “any negativity” she had received as a result of the musical and told The Project that this was “supposed to be me trying to make you feel like the icon I believe that you can be in Australia.”\nCNN’s George Ramsay contributed to this report.\n",

    "content": "A night of political upheaval in South Korea has upended stability in a key democratic US ally – sending shock waves through the region and Washington at a moment of acute global tension.\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law on Tuesday night in a surprise decree that was reversed hours later following overwhelming opposition across the political spectrum for what was widely seen as a breach of the country’s vibrant democracy.\nThe move, which Yoon claimed was necessary to “save the country against anti-state forces” trying to destroy the “constitutional order of liberal democracy,” was met by protests in Seoul and mounting calls for the president’s resignation.\nThe stunning development appeared to catch Washington off guard. That’s an unnerving reality for the United States military, which has nearly 30,000 troops and its largest overseas base in South Korea, serving as a check against a belligerent North Korea and counterweight to an aggressive China in a strategically critical region.\nThe turmoil has the potential for significant ramifications at a moment of deepening geopolitical fault lines in Asia, where both North Korea and China are strengthening their alignment with Russia as it wages war on Ukraine.\nLeaders in Pyongyang, Beijing and Moscow are likely watching the developments in Seoul with an eye to its potential to undermine a key bastion of US power in the region – and all eyes are now on North Korea, which may be keen to use the political chaos to its advantage.\nThe US-South Korea alliance has long been seen by both countries as a cornerstone of peace in the region, where North Korea continues to threaten South Korea and the US with its illegal weapons program.\nThat threat has only become more acute as North Korea has ramped up its partnership with Russia, sending ammunition, missiles, and soldiers, intelligence officials say, to aid Moscow’s war against Ukraine.\n“Any instability in South Korea has major ramifications for our Indo-Pacific policies,” retired US Col. Cedric Leighton told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, pointing to how US troops in the country are geared for a “fight tonight” scenario against North Korea. “The less stability there is in South Korea the worse it gets for us to fulfill our policy goals.”\nUS President Joe Biden has worked assiduously during his time in office to bolster the US partnership with South Korea, meeting Yoon multiple times, referring to the South Korean leader as a “great friend,” and earlier this year passing his “Summit for Democracy” to Yoon to host in South Korea.\nBiden’s efforts also included a landmark 2023 summit at Camp David with Japan and South Korea, where the US president navigated around historic mistrust between the two US allies to broker enhanced trilateral coordination.\nA US National Security Council spokesperson expressed “relief” after Yoon reversed course on what the spokesperson described as his “concerning declaration,” adding that “democracy is at the foundation” of the US-South Korea alliance.\nRelated article\nSouth Korea has been plunged into uncharted waters after an extraordinary night of political upheaval. What happens next?\nDespite US assurances that the alliance remains “ironclad,” the surprise move by Yoon could cast a level of doubt on the partnership and weaken the burgeoning Japan-South Korea partnership, observers say.\nIt also adds another level of uncertainty on the eve of the return to the White House of President-elect Donald Trump, who has previously expressed skepticism about the financial arrangement between the US and South Korea on hosting US troops.\n“Yoon’s actions most likely will raise questions about South Korea’s reliability and predictability as an ally and a partner in the eyes of the United States and Japan,” said Rachel Minyoung Lee, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington.\n“This is serious in light of the fact that there is now a stronger-than ever nuclear component in the (US-South Korea) alliance,” she added, pointing to a 2023 mechanism upgrading cooperation on nuclear deterrence between the US and South Korea, which does not have its own nuclear weapons but relies on the US arsenal.\nThe political turmoil also raises a potential opening for Kim Jong Un to capitalize on the chaos.\nThe North Korean leader is known to choose opportune political moments for major weapons tests – for example firing a new intercontinental ballistic missile days before the US presidential election last month.\n“We know that North Korea likes to lampoon South Korea’s democratic system whenever there is tumult in Seoul,” said Edward Howell, a lecturer in politics at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, who focuses on the Korean Peninsula.\n“We should not be surprised if Pyongyang exploits the domestic crisis in South Korea to its advantage, either rhetorically or otherwise,” he said.\nThe developments – and the potential, now, for a change of leadership in South Korea – are also likely being closely watched by Beijing and Moscow, who both deeply oppose US military presence in Asia.\nRelated article\nAs North Korea, Iran and China support Russia’s war, is a ‘new axis’ emerging?\nIn response from queries from reporters, China’s Foreign Ministry on Wednesday said it has “no comment” on South Korea’s internal affairs.\nChinese leader Xi Jinping and his officials in particular have watched with ire as the US has strengthened its partnerships with allies in the region – in the face of concerns in Washington about a growing threat from Beijing and its deepening security coordination with Moscow.\nAnd Yoon, who’s taken a harder line on North Korea than many of his predecessors, has been a willingly staunch partner of the US.\nThe Yoon government has also suggested that deployment of North Korean troops into Ukraine could cause it to reassess the level of military support it gives to the war-torn country, to which it does not directly supply lethal arms.\nAll that raises the international stakes for the current political moment, whatever its outcome for Yoon, according to Howell.\n“At a time when South Korea’s interests in the Ukraine war have gained prominence, given North Korea’s now full-fledged involvement, Seoul’s cooperation with allies cannot be hampered by domestic division,” he said.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n",

    "content": "Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple. Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being.\nWhile the holiday season is often a time rich with cheer, sentiment, love and family connections, it can also be a painful reminder of what once was or what many other people have but you don’t.\n“We’re shown this ideal version of the holidays, with partnered people, people with children, people with families in the matching pajamas with the gorgeous photos,” said Shani Silver, a New Orleans-based writer, podcaster and author of the Substack newsletter Cheaper Than Therapy.\nBut that notion excludes a massive number of people who won’t have “the cozy Norman Rockwell Christmas,” she added, including those who are newly single or estranged from family, or have lost a partner or other family member.\nRelated article\nBudget Christmas 101: Financial hardships don’t mean the holidays are canceled\nIf you’re troubled by your situation, it’s OK to honor your feelings and keep the celebrations low-key or sit this holiday season out, experts say. But you don’t have to refuse to celebrate because you’re without a partner or family.\nThis could be the holiday season in which you feel empowered to create new meaningful experiences with friends or the VIP in your life who is always there for you — yourself.\nHere’s how to figure out what’s best for you this holiday season.\nNot having a partner or close family to spend the holidays with can bring guilt, shame and blame, said Dr. Ayanna Abrams, an Atlanta-based clinical psychologist. You don’t have the life you’re “supposed” to have during this season, “and all of that exacerbates (your) feelings of loneliness and sadness,” she said.\nYou can still be filled with grief, especially if a breakup, estrangement or death was recent, Abrams added. “All of a sudden everything is different this year,” she said, and you may be longing for the traditions you had with the person you lost.\nIn such a transition, there’s no requirement to have the holidays look or feel the same as they always have, said Dr. Adam Brown, clinical psychologist and professor of psychology at The New School for Social Research in New York.\nJust as there is nothing wrong with not having these things, there is also nothing bad about wanting and missing them. But there comes a point when dwelling in sadness or shame keeps you from motivating yourself to chart your own path forward and from recognizing the loving people remaining in your life.\nRelated article\nMore than half of Americans say ‘alone time’ is essential to their mental well-being, survey finds\nSilver encourages single people to “stop viewing your holiday season as a consolation prize.”\nYour holiday season isn’t insignificant, said Silver, who has been single for 17 years. There’s no reason why you shouldn’t get to celebrate as fully as anyone else, and “a home with one person in it is still full,” she said. “Each individual human being on Earth is a valid person.”\nWhen you’re considering other ways to celebrate the holidays, think about what brings the most joy, Silver said.\n“We have this unique time available to us to define what we want to do as individuals, and a lot of people will never have that,” she added. “Not viewing it as a burden, but viewing it as a benefit, is one of the ways that you can start to really enjoy this time.”\nIf you always went to holiday markets or drive-through Christmas light shows with your ex, you can enjoy those activities alone or with friends, Silver said. Did your ex hate ice skating while you always wanted to try it? Now’s the time.\nTry doing some holiday baking, watching a movie at home or in a theater, going to a wine tasting or pop-up holiday experience, or cooking a recipe you’ve been eyeing forever.\nYou can still put up a tree and mail out holiday cards, Abrams said. Drive or walk through beautifully decorated neighborhoods or travel to visit a friend.\nRelated article\nOne small thing you can do for healthier food and exercise over holiday travel\nIf you have friends or acquaintances in the same boat as you, get together for a holiday dinner like Silver did last year, or for other plans.\nYou might feel like you don’t want to be a burden. But you never know what might happen if you tell a loved one that you’re feeling the need for connection and wondering what they’re doing for the holidays, Brown said.\nMaybe you’re sad about not having anyone leave you gifts under the tree, but you can do holiday shopping for things you’ve really wanted or organize a gift exchange among friends.\nTo keep the element of surprise, Silver used to order themed mystery gift boxes or Advent calendars she’d wait until Christmas Day to open. For those shopping in person, some bookstores wrap books in paper and write a description on the exterior so you don’t know what you’re getting.\nSilver also focuses on gifting herself intangibles, such as knocking out work projects early to have more time off.\nWorking with a therapist is one of the best ways to cope with struggles you may have during the season or other times of year, Abrams said. She recommended starting with one now, if needed, to get ahead of office closures. That’s especially true if you’re noticing any isolation, excessive sleep, trouble getting out of bed, substance misuse or loss of appetite.\nSometimes distractions are necessary, experts said. You can’t always avoid the pain or eliminate it, but you can learn to tolerate and hold space for it, Abrams said.\nRelated article\nWhat experts say about taking psilocybin as an alternative treatment for depression\nSelf-care can help you cope and experience more joy this year, Brown said. Do what helps you feel good and process your feelings, including exercising, journaling, talking things out in a voice recording, nourishing your body and using your support system.\nWhen considering whether to join the festivities, many people tend to think in all-or-nothing patterns: You either go to all the holiday parties or none. You deck all the halls of your house or leave everything bare.\n“We usually take away a lot of opportunities to have some semblance of something we want to experience,” Abrams said.\nConsidering the middle ground can help — maybe you don’t go to a gathering but still send a white elephant gift. Or plan on attending but only staying for an hour or so. Try decorating, but maybe just one room.\nIf grief strikes, stepping into another room or outside to cry, for example, is better than trying to repress emotion, Abrams said. Whether external or self-imposed, the pressure to just cheer up can make people feel a lot worse. (Cold air, though uncomfortable at first, can also be good for your mood, she said.)\n“You’re feeling this way because you are human,” she said.\nIf seeing all the happy, romantic holiday posts feels too difficult, taking a break from social media or muting certain accounts may help, Abrams said.\nShifting your mindset and how you compare yourself with someone else, on the other hand, may be in order, Silver said. “Being jealous is just one lens that you can choose,” she said. “You can also choose to see it as, ‘If it happened to them, it can happen to me.’”\nAnd if anyone asks nosy questions about your relationship status at a social gathering, you don’t owe them an answer, Silver said. You are just as worthy of dignity, respect and privacy as someone in a relationship.\nREAD MORE: Family member say something rude? Here’s what to say back, according to experts\nPreparing loose scripts of answers based on your boundaries and social dynamics can be useful, Abrams said, especially if you feel pressure to answer despite your feelings. You might say you don’t want to discuss it, that this season things are different or you just want to focus on the new. You could even preemptively let loved ones know via a text or phone call, which can save everyone an awkward moment.\nRegardless of what you do, Silver said she hopes you have as happy a holiday as anyone else — and urges you to choose the holiday season plans that you have the emotional bandwidth to handle.\n“Any way that you authentically want to spend the holidays is correct,” she said.\n",

    "content": "Known as a tax haven and playground for the rich, Monaco packs a population of around 39,000 — of whom almost seven in 10 are millionaires, according to property firm Knight Frank — into an area smaller than New York’s Central Park.\nBut the world’s second-smallest sovereign state has just grown by 3%.\nNew “eco-district” Mareterra, which has been built into the Mediterranean Sea, expands the microstate’s land mass by almost 15 acres. Inaugurated by Monaco’s Prince Albert II on Wednesday, the €2 billion ($2.1 billion) luxury development features a marina, seaside promenade and swathes of new high-end housing.\nAnnounced in 2013, the extensive land reclamation project saw concrete chambers, or caissons, built in the sea before being drained of water and filled with 750,000 metric tons of sand.\nAround half of the artificial landmass will be publicly accessible, with amenities including a park, cycle paths, a marina and shopping facilities. The district’s various green spaces have been planted with 1,000 trees imported from Tuscany, Italy.\nNew private residences on the site include more than 100 apartments and 10 palatial villas. Several high-profile architects, including Norman Foster and Tadao Ando, were commissioned to create structures in Mareterra. Italian architect Renzo Piano, best known for co-designing the Centre Pompidou, lent his name to the residential development building his firm designed on the site, Le Renzo.\nWhile housing prices have not been disclosed, Knight Frank estimates that properties in the district will fetch around 100,000 euros per square meter (or more than $9,750 per square foot, almost twice Monaco’s average).\nThe development was privately funded, though Monaco’s government will benefit from a 20% tax on all property sales. The city state’s conference center, the Grimaldi Forum, was also expanded as part of the project.\nLand is notoriously scarce in Monaco, which has a long history of building into the sea. Reclaimed land now accounts for more than a quarter of the principality’s territory. The most significant reclamation projects took place in the 1960s and 1970s, when the Larvotto and Fontvieille districts were expanded into the Mediterranean.\nEarlier land reclamation efforts attracted the ire of environmentalists worried about the impact on Monaco’s marine life, which today includes 60 species of coral.\nA more recent proposal was abandoned in 2009 due, in part, to ecological concerns raised by Prince Albert II, who is renowned for his work protecting ocean biodiversity.\nLand reclamation in Monaco is now tightly regulated, and Mareterra’s developers said they took various steps to “minimize the impact on the natural ecosystem as much as possible.” The project’s website says planners consulted marine experts and created new habitats for fish, including artificial seagrass beds.\nDevelopers also claim that 80% of heating and cooling in the district will run on renewable energy, including the power generated by more than 1.2 acres of solar panels.\n",

    "content": "TikTok’s US-based users could have only a few more weeks to enjoy scrolling through their For You Page before the app is banned in the country starting on January 19, 2025.\nA US appeals court on Friday upheld the law that requires TikTok to be sold off from its Chinese parent company ByteDance or face a ban, dealing a major blow to the social media platform that’s used by more than 170 million Americans.\nUnder the law, app stores could face major fines if they continue to host TikTok following the deadline, if it’s not sold. For users who already have the app downloaded, that likely means they could continue to use it for a while but would not be able to receive updates, which would eventually make it buggy and potentially useless.\nWhile the ruling increases the likelihood that TikTok will be banned, it’s not a done deal just yet.\nTikTok indicated that it plans to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. “The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans’ right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,” TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said in a statement Friday.\nRelated article\nTikTok is one step closer to being banned in the US\nHowever, the company suggested it has not budged on its earlier stance that it would not separate from ByteDance. Hughes said: “The TikTok ban, unless stopped, will silence the voices of over 170 million Americans here in the US and around the world on January 19th, 2025.”\nBeyond a successful appeal, there are a few other ways a TikTok ban could be delayed or avoided, including potential support from President-elect Donald Trump after he takes office. President Joe Biden could also technically grant a one-time, 90-day extension of the deadline, although he has not indicated that he will do so.\nWhen it appeals the ruling, TikTok could also ask for a stay — essentially, a pause — of the law while the Supreme Court reviews the case, which could mean TikTok avoids the January ban deadline, at least temporarily.\nStay or not, there’s reason to believe the Supreme Court will move quickly to render a decision on the case. Both TikTok and the US government had previously asked the US appeals court to expedite its ruling so the case could be appealed before the ban deadline.\n“The Supreme Court could set a schedule for briefing and set an oral argument in the first week of January,” Josh Schiller, partner at law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, told CNN.\nHowever, Schiller said TikTok is still likely to face an uphill battle in the Supreme Court.\n“Given the composure of the Supreme Court being largely conservative, and largely ideologically in favor of a limited federal government, even with that background … I have trouble thinking that the conservative force on the Supreme Court would not see this as a (national) security case,” and therefore rule in favor of upholding the law, Schiller said.\nThe Supreme Court could also decide not to review the case, in which case TikTok may be out of luck, according to Gautam Hans, associate director of the First Amendment Clinic and professor at Cornell Law School.\n“I am skeptical that the Supreme Court will take this case,” said Hans, who had signed on to an amicus brief supporting TikTok in the case. “They were pretty careful to write the opinion in a way that makes it less likely the Supreme Court would grant a review, and I think part of that has to do with the national security implications here… the court was really willing to take those claims seriously.”\nTrump could also represent a lifeline for TikTok’s US presence.\nAlthough it was Trump who first tried to ban TikTok from the United States during his previous term, he has more recently suggested that he no longer wants to ban the app.\nTrump said in June — in a video posted to the platform itself — that he would “never ban TikTok.”\nHowever, it’s not clear whether Trump will be able to do anything about it, given the ban is set to go into effect one day before his inauguration.\nRelated article\n5 big questions about how tech will look under Trump\nTrump could ask Congress to repeal the law, although experts say that effort would probably fail. From there, he likely has two options: He could direct the attorney general not to enforce the law or he could announce that TikTok is no longer subject to the law, University of Minnesota associate law professor Alan Rozenshtein told CNN last month.\nThe first approach would involve signaling to TikTok’s tech partners like Apple — which stand to face fines under the law if it continued to host TikTok on its app store after the deadline — that they “should feel free to continue business with TikTok,” Rozenshtein said. “But again, if you’re the general counsel of Apple, does that really give you a lot of confidence? You’re still violating the law. Trump is very mercurial.”\nThe second option would rely on a portion of the law that gives the president some authority to determine if a “qualified divestiture” of TikTok has taken place. In theory, Trump could declare that it has, whether or not that’s true, and then would have to hope it doesn’t get challenged in court. That approach could be more successful, given that “it’s not clear who could sue to enforce the law,” Rozenstein said.\nFriday’s ruling renewed jitters over a potential ban among US TikTok users who go to the platform to find connection, get entertained, seek information and earn a living.\nSome TikTok users had previously urged their representatives to vote “no” on the law. Others said that transitioning a large audience from TikTok to another platform is tricky, because each site has its own unique algorithm and monetization scheme.\n“TikTok is a huge part of my income and my livelihood, so I don’t want to see it falter,” lifestyle content creator Carrie Berk told CNN Friday. “However, there has been much discussion about TikTok being banned since 2020 and nothing has happened yet, so I’m skeptical. All we can do is cross our fingers for now that it doesn’t get banned.”\n“I still have my hopes that TikTok will not get banned in the United States but, currently, it doesn’t look good,” another user said in a video posted to the platform Friday.\nHowever, not every TikTok user is so concerned.\n“I don’t think it’s going to get banned” because of the millions of small US businesses who rely on the app, Keenya Kelly, a content strategist and creator who uses TikTok, told CNN. “I do think that they’re going to force TikTok to do some things that they don’t want to do, but I don’t think it’s going to be completely banned.”\n",

    "content": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.\nThe US government has imposed fresh export controls on the sale of high tech memory chips used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications to China.\nThe rules apply to US-made high bandwidth memory (HBM) technology as well as foreign-produced ones.\nHere’s everything you need to know about these cutting-edge semiconductors, which have seen demand soar along with the global frenzy for AI.\nHigh bandwidth memory (HBM) are basically a stack of memory chips, small components that store data. They can store more information and transmit data more quickly than the older technology, called DRAM (dynamic random access memory).\nHBM chips are commonly used in graphic cards, high-performance computing systems, data centers and autonomous vehicles.\nMost importantly, they are indispensable to running increasingly popular AI applications, including generative AI, which are powered by AI processors, such as the graphic processing units (GPU) produced by Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).\n“The processor and the memory are two essential components to AI. Without the memory, it’s like having a brain with logic but not having any memory,” G Dan Hutcheson, vice chair of TechInsights, a research organization specializing in chips, told CNN.\nThe latest set of export restrictions, announced on December 2, follow two previous rounds of curbs on advanced chips announced by the Biden administration over three years years, with a view to blocking China’s access to critical technology that could give it a military edge.\nAs retaliation, Beijing hit back by imposing fresh curbs on exports of germanium and gallium and other materials elements essential for making semiconductors and other high tech equipment.\nExperts say the latest export restrictions will slow China’s development of AI chips and, at most stall, its access to HBM. While China’s ability to produce HBM currently lags South Korea’s SK Hynix and Samsung and America’s Micron (MU), it is developing its own capabilities in the area.\n“What the US export restrictions would do is cut China’s access to HBM of better quality in the short run,” said Jeffery Chiu, CEO of Ansforce, an expert network consultancy specializing in tech, told CNN. “In the long run though, China will still be able to produce them independently, albeit with less advanced technologies.”\nIn China, Yangtze Memory Technologies and Changxin Memory Technologies are the leading manufacturers of memory chips. They are purportedly ramping up capacity to build HBM production lines to fulfill its strategic goal of tech self-sufficiency.\nWhat makes HBM chips so powerful is primarily their larger storage space and much faster speed of passing along data, compared to conventional memory chips.\nBecause AI applications require a lot of complex computing, such traits ensure that these applications run smoothly, without delays or glitches.\nLarger storage space means more data can be stored, transmitted and processed, which enhances the performance of AI applications as the large language models (LLM) enable them to have more parameters to train on.\nThink of the faster speed of sending over data, or higher bandwidth in chips parlance, as a highway. The more lanes a highway has, the less likely there will be a bottleneck and thus the more cars it can accommodate.\n“It’s like the difference between a two-lane highway and a hundred-lane highway.  You just don’t get traffic jams,” said Hutcheson.\nCurrently, just three companies dominate the global market of HBM.\nAs of 2022, Hynix accounted for 50% of the total market share for HBM, followed by Samsung at 40% and Micron at 10%, according to a research note published by Taipei-based market research agency TrendForce. Both South Korean firms are expected to take on similar shares in the HBM market in 2023 and 2024, collectively commanding around 95%.\nAs for Micron, the company aims to grow its HBM market share to somewhere between 20% and 25% by 2025, Taiwan’s official Central News Agency reported, citing Praveen Vaidyanatha, a senior executive at Micron.\nThe high value of HBM has led to all manufacturers dedicating a significant portion of its manufacturing capacity towards the more advanced memory chip. According to TrendForce’s Senior Research Vice President Avril Wu, HBM is expected to account for more than 20% of the total market for standard memory chips by value starting in 2024 and potentially exceeding 30% by next year.\nImagine stacking multiple standard memory chips in layers like a hamburger. That is essentially the structure of HBM.\nOn the surface it sounds simple enough, but it is no easy feat to pull off, so much so that it reflects on the price. The unit sales price of HBM is several times higher than that of a conventional memory chip.\nThat is because the height of an HBM is roughly that of six strands of hair, which means each layer of those standard memory chips that are stacked together need to be extremely thin as well, a feat that calls for top-notch manufacturing expertise known as advanced packaging.\n“Each of those memory chips need to be ground to as thin as the height of half a strand of hair before they are stacked together, something very difficult to pull off,” said Chiu.\nIn addition, holes are drilled on these memory chips before they are mounted on top of each other for electric wires to pass through, and the position and size of these holes need to be extremely precise.\n“You have a lot more failure points when you try to make these devices. It’s almost like building a house of cards,” Hutcheson said.\n",

    "content": "Chelsea star Cole Palmer broke an English Premier League record on Sunday as he scored two penalties in his side’s 4-3 comeback win against Tottenham.\nThe forward remained ice cold while converting two second-half spot kicks, bringing his tally up to 12 penalties in the league without missing. In doing so, he broke the previous record set by Manchester City’s Yaya Toure, who scored 11 consecutive penalties, per Opta.\nPalmer broke the record with an audacious ‘Panenka’ penalty in the 84th minute, chipping his second effort down the middle of the goal – a technique named after Czech football great Antonin Panenka.\n“When I put the ball down and stepped back, I knew what I was going to do,” he said after the game. “I thought it was late in the game and it was a bit crazy, so I just went for it.”\nPalmer, 22, has become one of the best players in the world since leaving Manchester City to join Chelsea in 2023.\nHe already has 50 goal involvements (33 goals, 17 assists) in 48 league games for his new club, form which has helped Chelsea rise to second in the table.\nThe Englishman didn’t drop his level against Tottenham, creating one of his side’s goals in addition to scoring his two penalties.\nThe match hadn’t started well for Chelsea, though, as host Tottenham capitalized on individual errors to take a 2-0 lead after just 11 minutes.\nBut Chelsea remained calm and cut the deficit in half after 17 minutes, courtesy of a fine strike by Jadon Sancho.\nPalmer then leveled the scores just after the hour-mark, converting a penalty after Yves Bissouma’s lunge brought down Moises Caicedo in the box.\nThe game then opened up and Chelsea found the go-ahead goal in the 73rd minute through Enzo Fernández’s strike. While the Argentine midfielder provided the finish, the chance was created by Palmer who took on several defenders before the ball broke to Fernández.\nPalmer made it 4-2 with his cheeky spot-kick, moments before Son Heung-min scored a consolation goal in the final seconds for Tottenham.\nThe win now puts Chelsea just four points behind league leader Liverpool, but the London side has played one more match.\nChelsea boss Enzo Maresca has played down the possibility of his side being in this season’s title race, given the team is still in the infancy of its rebuild.\n“After the game, my message to the players was to be focused day by day, in the next game, because if you start to think about where we are in three or four games, it’s completely wrong,” he said.\n“Enjoy the day off with the family and friends, and when we come back, go again with 100%, train well, get ready for the next game and improve day by day.”\n",

    "content": "The world now knows the colors of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad’s parachute: the Russian tricolor.\nAssad’s flight to Moscow following the swift collapse of his regime means more than just the loss of a client state for the Kremlin.\nThe fall of the House of Assad deals a major blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aspirations as a Middle East power broker – and raises new questions about the fragility of his own regime.\nPutin’s opponents are already cheering.\n“Minus one dictator and ally of Putin,” wrote prominent Russian opposition activist Ilya Yashin on X, posting a photo of an Assad banner in flames.\n“Putin has thrown Assad under the bus to prolong his war in Ukraine,” commented former Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. “His resources are scarce, and he is not as strong as he pretends.”\nFor observers of Russia’s war on Ukraine, Assad’s departure raises some striking historical parallels.\nAssad now joins a onetime Ukrainian counterpart in exile: Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych fled Ukraine for Russia in 2014 after weeks of street protests that culminated in a bloody crackdown.\nSyrians are now roaming through Assad’s abandoned presidential palace in Damascus, much as Ukrainians were able to visit the grounds of Mezhyhirya, the garish estate once occupied by Yanukovych.\nMezhyhirya was refashioned as a museum of corruption.\nYanukovych has not returned to Ukraine since his ouster, even though Russia now effectively controls more than 20% of Ukrainian territory following its full-scale invasion of the country in 2022.\nAnd unlike Assad, whose forces appeared to surrender Damascus without a fight, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky held fast as Russian troops approached Kyiv. (Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who also backed by the United States, did waver and Afghanistan fell to the Taliban in 2021.)\nAssad’s flight from Syria was more than a moment for Ukrainians to revel in a symbolic setback for Putin. The Syrian regime crumbled at the moment when Zelensky was in France to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron and US President-elect Donald Trump ahead of the reopening ceremony at Notre Dame Cathedral, where the Ukrainian leader received a standing ovation.\nRelated article\nIn a country splintered by civil war, could Syria’s rebels usher in a new dawn?\nUkraine is bracing for the consequences of Trump’s re-election victory amid fears that the incoming administration could withdraw support for Kyiv. But the implosion of Assad’s regime could potentially weaken Putin’s hand in negotiations over ending the war in Ukraine, particularly if Putin’s bellicose threats in recent weeks of nuclear escalation are perceived as hollow.\nAs rebel fighters closed in on Damascus, Trump himself nodded to the Kremlin’s narrowing range of options in a post on social media. “Russia, because they are so tied up in Ukraine, and with the loss there of over 600,000 soldiers, seems incapable of stopping this literal march through Syria, a country they have protected for years,” he wrote.\nBut the collapse of the Assad regime represents a very real military loss to Putin. In the wake of rebel advances, video emerged showing the toppling of a monument to Assad in Tartus, on Syria’s Mediterranean coast, where Moscow has kept a naval base since the Cold War. Russia has also relied on its airbase at Hmeimim, in Syria’s Latakia province, as a hub for projecting power in the Middle East.\nIn a visit to Hmeimim in 2017, Putin pledged that the two bases would “continue to operation on a permanent basis,” warning that if “the terrorists” – i.e., the opponents of Assad – “raise their heads again, we will deal unprecedented strikes unlike anything they have seen.”\nWhen Putin intervened directly in Syria nearly a decade ago, sending his air force and Russian mercenaries to prop up Assad’s losing forces in concert with Iran, his escalation paid dividends: He bought time for Assad, brought more of Syria’s geography under government control, and showed himself as an essential player in regional and global politics.\nOnce shunned at the G20 summit in 2014 after his annexation of the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine and his stoking of separatism in Ukraine’s Donbas region, Putin was the man to speak to a year later. By doubling down on Assad, the Kremlin leader went from zero to hero, at least in the geopolitical war of perceptions.\nRelated article\nTrump has big plans at home, but Syria shows why he can’t escape the world’s problems\nPutin’s pledges of support for Assad a decade ago now seem empty. But it may still be early to write off Putin as a rival negotiator and potential adversary, despite the ouster of his client.\nTatiana Stanovaya, a close observer of Putin, suggested in a post on X that Assad’s defeat may harden Putin’s negotiating position on Ukraine.\n“Putin may raise additional conditions and will not agree to negotiations readily. He will insist that it is now up to the West and Ukraine to change their stance,” she said, noting Trump’s calls on Putin to end the war in Ukraine.\n“Note that Assad’s collapse has also shaken Putin, making him less inclined to demonstrate flexibility with Ukraine. The war in Ukraine has, to some extent, cost him Syria, which reinforces his unwillingness to compromise.”\nPutin has long seen himself locked in an adversarial conflict with the West, and he faces a warrant from the International Criminal Court over alleged war crimes in Ukraine.\nThe ouster of Assad may only harden his position.\n",

    "content": "An arson attack on a synagogue in Melbourne last week is being investigated as terrorist incident, Australian officials said Monday, as the government announced it was establishing a new task force to combat antisemitism.\nThe Adass Israel Synagogue in the city’s south – one of Australia’s most significant Jewish centers – burst into flames early on Friday sending worshippers fleeing during overnight prayers.\nVictoria Police Chief Commissioner Shane Patton on Monday said the “horrific, callous and targeted” attack was “likely a terrorist incident” and would be investigated by a joint counter-terrorism team including Victoria Police, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO).\nPatton said police were searching for three suspects in connection with the firebombing but would not go into detail about their identities or whether they were known to police.\nThere was no evidence to suggest there would be any more attacks against other synagogues in Melbourne, said Patton, who added that officers would continue to patrol areas with a large Jewish population.\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Friday’s fire at the Melbourne synagogue was the third antisemitic attack in recent months.\nThe Australian Federal Police had established a special task force called Operation Avalite to respond to the attacks, which include a fire at a Jewish minister’s Melbourne office and vandalism targeting cars in a Jewish area of Sydney.\nAFP Commissioner Reece Kershaw said the national force would play a greater role in policing threats, violence and hatred toward the Jewish community.\n“Unfortunately, in Australia today those of Jewish ethnicity and religion are being targeted because of who they are,” he said. “The AFP will not tolerate crimes that undermine Australia’s security or our way of life.”\nOn the weekend, the Albanese government committed an extra 32.5 million Australian dollars (close to $21 million) to increase security at Jewish community sites across the country, including synagogues and schools.\nJewish communities across Australia have called out a drastic increase in antisemitic attacks since the Hamas attacks on October 7, 2023 and Israel’s ensuing war in Gaza.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the Melbourne attack as “an abhorrent act of antisemitism,” and linked the firebombing to the Australian government’s support of a United Nations resolution calling on Israel to end all hostilities in Gaza.\n“Unfortunately, it is impossible to separate this reprehensible act from the extreme anti-Israeli position of the Labor government in Australia, including the scandalous decision to support the UN resolution calling on Israel ‘to bring an end to its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, as rapidly as possible,’” the Prime Minister’s Office statement said on Friday.\nThe statement also pointed to Australia’s decision to stop former Israeli minister Ayelet Shaked from entering the country for a speaking tour. Australia’s home affairs minister said Shaked was denied a visa over fears her presence would undermine social cohesion.\nOf the UN vote, Albanese said Monday that Australia cast its vote along with 157 nations – including most of its Five Eyes partners – and that its position on the conflict hadn’t changed.\n“Australia has had for a long period of time … a bipartisan position for a two-state solution in the Middle East … that is still my government’s position,” he said.\nCNN’s Angus Watson contributed to this report.\n",

    "content": "At the historic Umayyad Mosque in the heart of Damascus, a red, white, black and green flag flies.\nOn the other side of the Syrian capital, former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s palace burns.\nAn anchor reads the Sunday news: “We announce to you from the Syrian news channel the victory of the great Syrian revolution after 13 years of patience and sacrifice.”\nAnd on the streets, hundreds of people cheer, celebrating the stunning fall of 50 years of the Assad family’s dictatorship.\nAfter less than two weeks of fighting across Syria’s northwest, rebel groups swiftly seized control of the capital. Their presence seemed to catch the regime off guard, forcing Assad to flee to Russia with his family.\n“We are now the happiest country in the world,” one man told CNN on the road leading to Damascus on Sunday.\nIn a speech from the Umayyad Mosque on Sunday, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, the leader of Syria’s main rebel group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), called the toppling of Assad a “victory for the entire Islamic nation.”\n“This is a nation that, if its rights are taken, will continue to demand them until they are restored,” Jolani said, adding that HTS was liberating people who were imprisoned by the Assad regime.\nTheir swift move into the capital astonished citizens and the rest of the world.\nHere’s how the rebels’ ascent to power unfolded:\nSyrian rebel forces launched a large-scale attack on Assad’s forces in western Aleppo, the first sign of what was to come from their offensive and marking the first flare-up between the two sides in years.\nAt least 37 people were killed – both regime forces and allied militia –  and rebels seized 13 villages, including the strategic towns of Urm al-Sughra and Anjara, as well as Base 46, the largest Syrian regime army base in western Aleppo, according to a statement by opposition factions at the time.\nIt was unclear then if the attacks meant anything more. Rebel groups said they were in response to recent artillery shelling from Assad’s regime.\nBut it quickly became clear that wasn’t the case. Three days later, the first city would fall.\nOn November 30, the rebel groups conducted a lightning-fast offensive, killing dozens of government soldiers and taking control of Aleppo, Syria’s second-largest city.\nIt was the first time they had set foot there since government forces regained control in 2016. By early morning, they had seized large parts of the city, footage geolocated by CNN revealed.\nThe Syrian army tacitly acknowledged its forces were in retreat, saying “large numbers of terrorists” had forced it to “implement a redeployment operation.” It said reinforcements were on their way and government forces were preparing for a “counteroffensive.”\nThe rebels continued their offensive onward to the city of Hama.\nHama is strategically located at a key crossroads in western-central Syria, providing direct supply lines between Damascus and Aleppo.\nThe Assad regime had held Hama for more than a decade, but by Thursday the Syrian military said it had to withdraw after rebels “penetrated several parts of the city.”\nVideos geolocated by CNN showed rebel fighters celebrating – almost in disbelief at their progress – as they entered Hama.\n“Guys, my country is being liberated. I swear to God, we are inside Hama city, we are inside Aleppo city,” a fighter cheered as he filmed himself by a local landmark in Hama.\nFrom there, the rebels had their eyes set on Homs.\nThe opposition forces continued their push onwards toward Damascus, seizing the city of Daraa with the assistance of rebel factions who represented the Druze sect in the neighboring city of as-Suwayda.\nThe army said it was “redeploying” after the attack, with rebels attacking the forces from both the north and the south.\nIn the southern city of Homs, hundreds of people appeared to flee on Friday night as rebel forces said they reached the city wall.\nAfter moving south for days, the HTS quickly took control of Homs.\nOn Saturday evening, the HTS said it had “fully liberated” the major city, as Syrians tore down posters of Assad and set fire to them.\n“We were able to liberate four Syrian cities within 24 hours: Daraa, Quneitra, Suwayda and Homs,” said Lt. Col.

    "content": "American model Alex Consani has become the first transgender woman to win Model of the Year, following a string of high-profile runway appearances for labels like Chanel, Stella McCartney and Victoria’s Secret.\nThe in-demand 21-year-old, who is known for her distinctive bleached hair and eyebrows, claimed the title at the 2024 Fashion Awards in London on Monday evening.\nIn her acceptance speech, Consani told a star-studded audience at the Royal Albert Hall that her victory marked a “big step in the right direction.”\n“Now, more than ever, it’s an important conversation that should be had about how to truly support and uplift one another within this industry, especially those who have been made to feel insignificant,” she added, to cheers from the crowd, after collecting her trophy from model and body activist Ashley Graham and “Baby Reindeer” star Nava Mau.\n“Because change is more than possible — it’s needed.”\nHaving signed with IMG Models (an agency representing supermodels including Claudia Schiffer, Hailey Bieber and the Hadid sisters) in 2019, Consani rose to prominence through TikTok, where she now boasts almost 4 million followers. She made her catwalk debut for Tom Ford in 2021 and later walked for top labels such as Alexander McQueen and Versace.\nIn October, Consani and Valentina Sampaio made history by becoming the first trans models to appear on the runway at the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show.\nWearing a ripped Union Flag dress by Turkish-British designer Dilara Findikoglu, California-born Consani used her acceptance speech to honor the Black transgender women — including fellow models Connie Fleming and Aaron Rose Philip — who “really fought for the space … that allowed me to flourish today.” She also paid tribute to her parents for supporting her modeling aspirations.\nRelated article\nCan a troubled Victoria’s Secret successfully write its next chapter? It’s certainly pulling out all the stops\nRecognizing the “the global impact” of someone who has “dominated the industry” in the last 12 months, the prestigious Model of the Year prize combines the opinion of an industry panel with the result of a public vote, according to award organizers the British Fashion Council. Black trans model Kai-Isaiah Jamal was among the nominees for last year’s award, which was ultimately won by plus-size model Paloma Elsesser.\nElsewhere at Monday’s ceremony, Jonathan Anderson, creative director of Loewe and founder of JW Anderson, won the coveted Designer of the Year award for the second consecutive year. And Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour presented Tom Ford with the Outstanding Achievement Award.\nFeaturing performances from Blondie singer Debbie Harry and Afrobeats star Wizkid, the glitzy ceremony saw major fashion industry figures rub shoulders with the stars of entertainment, music and sport, including Rita Ora and Venus Williams. Also in attendance (and wearing an eye-catching blue furry hat) was Rihanna, whose partner A$AP Rocky took home the Cultural Innovator Award.\nCategories for the best British menswear and womenswear designers were meanwhile awarded to Grace Wales Bonner and Simone Rocha, respectively. Rocha’s acceptance speech was among several political moments, as she took the stage with a call to “free Palestine.”\nEarlier in the evening, an animal rights demonstrator stormed the red carpet to protest the fashion industry’s use of feathers — just days after London Fashion Week’s announced that it will become the first of the “big four” fashion weeks to ban exotic animal skins on its runways.\n",

    "content": "When legendary former Intel CEO Andy Grove wrote his bestseller “Only the Paranoid Survive” in 1996 about how to predict tech inflection points that might undermine a business, the notion that his company might face such a risk was purely theoretical.\nAt the time, Intel was the world’s largest producer of computer chips, and its technology was housed inside nearly every PC. Grove’s mission was for his leading American tech company to do more than just supply the parts, but to drive an ambitious vision for the future of computing in which PCs would be used for everything from watching movies and playing games to storing photos and staying connected to friends. Intel would power all of them.\nIntel may have predicted the evolution of PCs, but it missed the boat on both mobile computing and the AI boom, the two major technology waves that have defined the past decade and a half. That means nearly two decades after Grove outlined his vision, Intel is a shell of its former self.\nRelated article\nIntel CEO resigns after a disastrous tenure\nIntel’s stock hit its all-time high more than 24 years ago: on August 31, 2000. In recent years it has plunged — it is currently down a stunning 68% from its record. In August, the company said it would lay off 15% of its staff as part of an effort to slash $10 billion in costs. And last month, Intel lost its spot in the Dow Jones Industrial Average to Nvidia, marking the end of a 25-year run that began when it was among the first two technology firms to be included in the blue-chip index.\nOn Monday, the company announced the retirement of CEO Pat Gelsinger, the decades-long company veteran who was thought of as a sort of prodigal son who would return to fix the company when he took over the top job nearly three years ago. But Gelsinger failed to right the ship. And now, investors and company watchers are seriously questioning whether Intel can ever regain its industry-leading position, despite its importance to American chipmaking.\n“The odds of them going back to the glory days, at this point in time, looks very bleak,” said Angelo Zino, technology analyst at CFRA Research.\nThe cracks in Intel’s dominance first began to show around 2010. Apple’s first iPhone had launched three years earlier, and the company picked little-known British chip designer ARM to design its processor.\nUp until that point, ARM had been seen as a smaller player designing technology for a niche, lower-margin market. But suddenly, mobile devices were the next big thing, offering users many of the perks of a PC right in their pocket. And because ARM was ready with the technology, it quickly leapfrogged Intel as the mobile chipmaking leader.\nThat shift also foreshadowed a time, years later, when Apple and other device makers dealt another blow to Intel by replacing its processors in some PCs with more efficient, ARM-based chips.\nOther rivals, like AMD, also stole market share in the PC business, as they predicted the rise of cloud computing and as Intel struggled to keep pace with the intense innovation timeline that’s come to be known as “Moore’s law,” named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, who estimated that chips could be made with twice the number of transistors, increasing their power and speed, every two years.\nIn 2019, Intel was forced to release a rare public apology after its halting efforts to make more advanced chips exacerbated shortages and delays of its existing products.\nEven now, Intel “continues to cede PC/server shares to AMD and ARM,” Bank of America Securities analyst Vivek Arya wrote in a research note Monday. “Meanwhile, PC demand outlook remains grim.”\nThe company now has around 65% share market share in traditional PCs and 85% share in servers, according to a Monday report from Edward Jones technology analyst Logan Purk.\nWhen Gelsinger took over in 2021, he was tasked with reviving Intel advanced manufacturing capabilities and getting the company back on a regular pace of innovation.\nAnd during his tenure, Gelsinger “has done a great job on that front,” Zino said.\nBut while he was focused on improving manufacturing for an existing line of products, another fundamental technology shift was underway that had notable similarities to the mobile evolution that caught Intel flat-footed a decade earlier.\nNvidia — once a tiny Intel competitor making graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming applications — became, in the span of a few years, essential to the tech industry because those same chips are needed to efficiently power the massive data processing needs of artificial intelligence. Nvidia is now the second-most-valuable company in the world; its $3.4 trillion market value is 33 times bigger than Intel’s $104 billion value.\nIntel, once again, didn’t have the products to compete with rivals like Nvidia and AMD in AI, whose innovations are pushing forward the next major technology wave. An AI accelerator chip called Gaudi that Intel released this year in an effort to carve out some share failed to gain the kind of traction the company was hoping for.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during an interview at a Wired event Tuesday that it’s “probably not unexpected and it’s probably even understandable” that Intel was too focused on its core central processing unit (CPU) chips to predict that the AI boom would demand a shift to GPUs.\nBecause of “the incredible pace of innovation around deep learning and machine learning, the world went from coding and coding instructions that ran on CPUs to machine learning and neural networks that run on GPUs. This force is so incredible,” said Huang, who called Intel a “really important company.” He added: “It’s not as if you can compete against this … (And) this all happened in 10 years. So, you’re either preparing for that 10-year trend or you get caught off guard by that.”\nAt the same time, Gelsinger pushed for a risky and expensive bid to expand the use of Intel’s foundries — historically a point of pride for the company — to manufacture processors for competitors like Apple, putting it into more direct competition with chipmaking giant TSMC. That effort has been central to a push by the Biden administration to revitalize chip manufacturing on American soil. But even that has been dogged by delays.\nUncertainty over Intel’s future product road map and whether it can find sufficient customers for that foundry business to account for the tens of billions of dollars in investment have also made investors antsy.\n“They know from their history that having great foundry capabilities as well as great products provide a synergy,” Forrester senior analyst Alvin Nguyen told CNN. “But the thing is, the synergy is only realized when both parts, products and semiconductor foundry aspects, are healthy. And that’s clearly not that situation right now.”\nFor the new interim co-CEOs who have taken over in Gelsinger’s place – CFO David Zinsner and Michelle (MJ) Johnston Holthaus, who was also elevated from her role as general manager of Intel’s client computing group to the newly-created CEO of Intel products – there is some hope that producing lower-cost, lower-performance but more energy-efficient AI products could be a hit with smaller companies that don’t need the kind of massive computing capacity Nvidia’s pricier chips can provide, Nguyen said. Still, they’ll face real questions about whether the company could be sold to a competitor or certain parts spun off.\nIntel’s struggles have raised questions about a potential takeover by a rival like Qualcomm, a possibility that may be more practical under the incoming Trump administration, which is expected to be less aggressive in pursuing antitrust concerns.\nAnalysts have also raised the possibility of a spin-off of Intel’s foundry unit or an asset sale, but that could be complicated by a massive investment it received from the US government through the CHIPS Act – a national security initiative to fund US chipmakers.\n“Intel must retain a majority ownership of its Foundry business to receive CHIPS Act funding, which hinders the potential for an acquisition or spinoff options for this capital-intensive business,” Purk said.\nIntel could also stand to benefit if tensions between China and Taiwan, where chip giant TSMC produces many of the world’s processors for other chipmakers, were to ratchet up, Zino said. In that case, chipmakers could look to Intel’s US facilities to make more of their products.\nFor now, the company is focused on “working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel,” Frank Yeary, Intel’s independent board chair, who was named interim executive chair following Gelsinger’s exit, said in a statement Monday. Investors will be anxiously waiting to learn whether that includes accurately predicting the next major technology wave.\n“The fact of the matter is, you have to be able to call the inflections,” Zino said.\n",

    "publishedAt": "6:00 AM EST, Mon December 9, 2024",
    "content": "Years before he was Donald Trump’s pick to lead the FBI, Kash Patel was a midlevel Justice Department lawyer who once drew the ire of a Texas judge who described Patel as being precisely the kind of federal bureaucrat he has vowed to weed out in his crusade against the so-called deep state.\nIn January 2016, Patel had just landed from a trip to Tajikistan as part of his job with the DOJ’s National Security Division when he turned up at a Texas courthouse to join the government trial team in a federal counterterrorism case. Though it had been proceeding for weeks, it was Patel’s first time showing up in person as part of the prosecution.\nThe judge was immediately suspicious of him.\n“Who is this Patel guy?” Judge Lynn Hughes asked the government’s lawyers, criticizing one of them for letting Patel use his account to enter his notice of appearance in the case.\nRelated article\nWho is Kash Patel, Trump’s pick for FBI director?\nLater in his chambers, the judge ripped into Patel for not wearing a suit and tie, telling him he didn’t add a “bit of value” to the government’s team and accused Patel of being a “spy” for his bosses in DC.\n“You’re just one more nonessential employee from Washington,” said Hughes, who later doubled down by issuing an “order on ineptitude” on Patel and his Justice Department colleagues and putting the episode in the court record.\nThe encounter, which was reported at the time by The Washington Post, makes an appearance in Patel’s 2023 book, “Government Gangsters,” where he wrote that DOJ leadership were “cowards” for not publicly defending him and that the department “didn’t have my back.”\nThe encounter also made an impression on some of Patel’s colleagues. Though judges routinely dress down government lawyers, it was clear that the incident was notable and bothered Patel.\n“We were actually supportive and sympathetic,” one former colleague recalled.  “But he had a conspiracy theory that the US attorney’s office had set him up and he wanted us to get vengeance.”\nIt wasn’t until much later, after Patel had risen to top national security positions inside the White House and Pentagon toward the end of the first Trump administration, that Patel’s reaction to the incident  fully made sense, the former colleague said.\n“Thinking back about it now, I can see the arc of him going from this guy who was obsessed with one episode to someone who sees enemies everywhere,” the person said. “I think he was always like this, an opportunist who feels constantly aggrieved.”\nPatel’s years as a government lawyer, first as a public defender in Miami, then later as an attorney in the Obama-era Justice Department, are crucial to understanding his disdain for the elites who run Washington.\nPatel, who begins his rounds on Capitol Hill this week as part of his confirmation process, rose rapidly as a star in the MAGA movement, coining a gold-flecked moniker, K$H, to sell merchandise including T-shirts and Trump-adjacent children’s books. That rise has been driven by ambition, an uncanny survival instinct, and a strong sense of grievance toward the government he used to work for, according to people who have worked with him over decades.\nInterviews with more than a dozen individuals who worked with Patel shed new light on his path to power. After what appears to be a satisfactory, if unremarkable, legal career, Patel gained a reputation as a useful Republican Hill staffer on the House Intelligence Committee, where he dug into the origins of the FBI’s Russia investigation of the Trump campaign. After joining the White House as a member of the National Security Council, Patel became known as an aggressive colleague, sources say, often clashing with others.\nPatel’s biggest success, sources say, was his ability to cultivate a close relationship with Trump. Multiple former Trump officials told CNN he appeared at times more focused on getting face time with Trump than on actually doing his job.\n“Clearly, his strategy ultimately worked,” one source said about Patel’s efforts to get close to Trump dating to 2019.\nRelated article\nKash Patel, Trump’s pick to lead FBI, has been targeted in an Iranian hack, sources say\nWhile his proximity to Trump has ebbed and flowed since he left office, Patel has remained one of the loudest critics of the FBI, calling it the “prime functionary of the Deep State” in his book and suggesting in a recent podcast that he would dismantle the FBI’s headquarters in DC on Day 1, turning it into “a museum” for the crookedness he says he saw there.\nDespite Trump allies’ insistence that he’s fit for the job, many of those who crossed paths with Patel, including Democrats on Capitol Hill, are skeptical about his ability to run the FBI, given the sheer scope of the job.\n“The (FBI) director leads an agency that’s going after Russian and Chinese spies, mobsters, kidnappers,” one source familiar with the transition’s discussions about the FBI job told CNN. “The biggest job he’s ever had was an NSC senior director, which is a big job, but it usually manages, what, 12 people? The FBI has 35,000 employees.”\nNot everyone who has worked with Patel agrees. Earl Matthews, a former Trump official who worked with Patel in the White House, said he brings a unique resume to the job.\n“How many FBI directors have been criminal defense attorneys?” Matthews said. “He’s been a criminal defense attorney, and he’s also been a prosecutor. He’s been on both sides of that legal dichotomy. … So, that’s a unique perspective that might be good for an FBI director.”\nIn response to a detailed list of questions from CNN about Patel, a Trump transition spokesperson provided a blanket statement of support.\n“Kash Patel excelled as a terrorism prosecutor for the DOJ and received an award in 2017 from the DOJ for his efforts prosecuting members of the al-Shabaab terrorist organization. As former National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien has said, Kash is ‘one of the most experienced people ever to be nominated for FBI director,’” Alex Pfeiffer said in a statement. “America is going to be safer with Kash Patel as the FBI Director.”\nIn his book, Patel wrote that he first became interested in becoming a lawyer after caddying for defense attorneys in Long Island, New York, and dreaming of the money he could make in the profession – a dream he said never materialized.\nInstead, after no one would hire him fresh out of Pace University Law School in 2005, Patel decided to pursue a career as a public defender in part because of how much he enjoyed trial litigation in law school, according to his book.\nAs a public defender in Florida for eight years, people who worked with Patel at the time recall him as good at face-to-face interactions and building rapport with judges, but uninterested in the paperwork and legal arguments that came with the job.\nIn his book, Patel wrote that he didn’t fit in with his cohort of defense attorneys, who he said were politically on the left, juxtaposed to what he describes as his more conservative upbringing and personal beliefs.\nPatel made the move to Washington when he was hired as an attorney in the Justice Department’s National Security Division in late 2013, according to his book.\nOne colleague who has known Patel since his years as a Miami public defender said what many critics don’t see is that Patel has always felt underestimated – especially by many of the Ivy League lawyers he was surrounded by at the Justice Department’s DC headquarters, who he thought had an easier time getting jobs.\n“These people always looked down at him,” the longtime former colleague said. “But he has to be a smart guy to get where he is. He is a survivor.”\nAfter the 2016 election, Patel was hired by then-Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee at the time, who promised to use his investigative powers to look into the FBI’s probe of connections between Trump’s campaign and Russia. According to Patel’s book, Nunes said that if he helped with the investigation, he would “do everything he could” to help land Patel his dream job working for the National Security Council at the White House.\nRelated video\nHear how classified Russian intel went missing in final days of Trump administration\nPatel quickly gained notice among Trump allies for helping to write a brief report – which became known as the “Nunes Memo” – detailing alleged errors made by the DOJ in obtaining a warrant to surveil a former campaign adviser to Trump. Patel’s work found a ready audience in conservative media and eventually gained the attention of Trump.\nThe DOJ Inspector General later released a report that found there were problems with the FBI’s surveillance but did not find that the bureau conducted the Russia investigation with partisan motivations, despite claims from Republicans.\nBy 2019, after Republicans lost their House majority, Nunes worked to make good on his promise to help Patel get to the White House.\n“(Patel) was forced on the NSC by Devin Nunes and Trump,” said Charles Kupperman, who served at the time as Trump’s deputy national security adviser.\nKupperman told CNN that Trump personally asked him and then-national security adviser John Bolton to find Patel a job at the White House – a request they initially rebuffed.\nA couple of months later, Kupperman said Trump called him and Bolton again with a second request to find Patel a job at the NSC.\n“We said, ‘OK, Mr. President, we’re seriously trying to find him an appropriate job. But given his background right now we don’t have an appropriate position,’” Kupperman said.\n“The third time Trump calls he says, ‘Look just, just get him a job.’ And so, we put him in the international organization directorate,” Kupperman added, referring to an obscure agency within the NSC.\nStill, Kupperman said he had serious suspicions about Patel, fueled in part by what he says was Patel’s reputation for leaking sensitive information to conservative media outlets while working for Nunes.\nOne day, months after hiring Patel, Kupperman said he walked into the Oval Office for a meeting with Trump only to find that Patel, a low-level NSC staffer, was already in the room.\n“‘Why is Kash here for this meeting?’” Kupperman said he remembered thinking. As he and members of the White House counsel’s office sat down, Kupperman said Trump started talking about expanding Patel’s responsibilities to include finding out who in the White House and the NSC weren’t sufficiently loyal and had been leaking information.\nKupperman told CNN that he and White House counsel Pat Cipollone pushed back on the idea – insisting that there were other ways to ensure no one on the NSC was leaking. Cipollone did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on the episode. But as the conversation went on, Trump got a phone call from Fox News host Sean Hannity, Kupperman said.\n“So he puts him on the speaker phone. He goes, ‘Sean, I’m sitting here with Charlie Kupperman, John Eisenberg, Cipollone and Kash Patel, and we’re having a meeting,’” Kupperman told CNN. “And you know, Sean Hannity says to Trump, ‘Oh, I love Kash Patel.’”\nUltimately, Kupperman said he and White House lawyers were able to block Patel’s proposal to become Trump’s “political commissar,” a role that would have allowed him to monitor NSC staffers’ emails and cell phones to identify leakers.\nBut the episode offers a window into how Patel would subsequently leverage his relationship with Trump and some of the president’s key allies to advance his career.\nSoon after the 2019 Oval Office meeting, Patel successfully lobbied for the job of senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council.\nWhile in that role, Patel continued to harp on the Russia investigation, gaining more favor with Trump and building up his reputation as a staunch loyalist, especially as he worked to declassify portions of the Nunes memo.\nKash Patel, a Trump loyalist and election denier, has called the FBI biased, vowed to radically change the agency, and come after the media.\nRelated video\nTrump’s controversial FBI pick has vowed to dismantle it\n“He’s shown some efficacy in bringing to light otherwise classified or sensitive information into the public domain    when others were not able to do that,” said one source familiar  with Patel’s work on the House Intelligence Committee and subsequent efforts related to the Russia probe. “So clearly, a willingness to push the envelope to sort of fight against norms, standard practice, for the benefit of getting information out or embarrassing the intelligence community or the administration – or in this case, perhaps justifying President Trump’s actions.”\nPatel, the individual said, “is clearly dogged and determined and won’t take no for an answer, and those types of traits that I’m sure are appealing to the president.”\nIt was one of the reasons Patel was moved to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence as a principal deputy under acting Director Richard Grenell in early 2020 as Trump sought to install loyalists inside the US intelligence agencies and tasked them with rooting out the so-called deep state he believed opposed him.\nThroughout Trump’s first term, Patel regularly inserted himself into situations he believed would help him gain favor with Trump. But once involved, Patel often demonstrated a lack of expertise and attention to detail that proved disruptive, multiple sources said.\nThat was true in October 2020 when Patel nearly compromised efforts to rescue an American who was captured in West Africa, according to Trump’s former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper.\nRelated video\nTrump’s former defense secretary responds to Patel’s claims of ‘treasonous’ actions\nEsper told CNN that he launched US special operators to rescue the American “on the premise we had airspace clearance into that country to conduct that operation” – information that Esper believed came from Patel.\n“And we found out hours later that it was not true,” Esper told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, adding that by that time, the Navy SEAL team was already in the air. “For a moment in time there, at least an hour, it jeopardized the mission,” he said.\nWhile the raid ultimately was successful, Esper said the breakdown, attributed in part to Patel, could have put the captured American’s life at risk and warranted further investigation after the fact.\nBut there is no evidence that Patel’s role in the incident was ever scrutinized. Another source familiar with the incident told CNN that some national security officials who worked with Patel on Africa issues no longer trusted the work he produced and even found other mistakes later that had to be corrected.\nJust months later, Patel was elevated to a new role at the Pentagon after Esper and other top defense officials were fired by Trump. Trump’s decision to install Patel as chief of staff for then-acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller was widely viewed as a reward for the loyalty he had demonstrated and would come to define his subsequent rise in the years that followed.\nThat appointment came after Trump sought to install Patel as deputy FBI director, a position that is traditionally held by a career FBI agent, a move that then-Attorney General William Barr blocked.\nWhile at the Pentagon, Patel worked to help Trump try to overturn the 2020 election results in yet another demonstration of loyalty that has become a prerequisite for candidates seeking top jobs in his second administration.\nThose relationships and Patel’s previous face time with Trump would prove valuable as the president-elect mulled over candidates to serve as FBI director during his second term.\nPatel benefited from an informal and personality-based interview process for the job, two sources familiar with the discussions said. He was also buoyed by the backing of prominent voices in the decision-making process, including Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Ric Grenell – endorsements that gave him an edge over other top candidates like former GOP Rep. Mike Rogers, the sources said.\nAnother source close to the transition also characterized Patel’s views related to the FBI as “radical,” even for those in Trump’s orbit who share the view that major changes are needed at the agency.\n“This was Trump getting back at the FBI,” the source said.\nGiven the president-elect’s rhetoric around retribution during the campaign, there is an expectation that Patel may be primed to investigate Trump’s political adversaries. Asked during his interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press” about previously saying he would direct his Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate President Joe Biden, Trump said he would not but left the door open for top DOJ officials to make their own determinations, including his pick for attorney general, Pam Bondi.\n“No, I’m not doing that unless I find something that I think is reasonable,” Trump said in the interview, which aired Sunday. “But that’s not going to be my decision. That’s going to be Pam Bondi’s decision, and, to a different extent, Kash Patel, assuming they’re both there, and I think they’re both going to get approved.”\nTrump suggested he had concerns that Patel’s vocal support of the MAGA movement might make him a difficult pick, but instead, Trump said, conservatives have rallied to support Patel.\n“He’s very popular,” Trump said, calling Patel “very good and very fair.”\n“I’ll tell you, I thought Kash may be difficult because he’s, you know, a strong conservative voice and I don’t know of anybody that’s not singing his praises,” Trump said.\nOne former colleague who has known Patel for over a decade believes criticism of him is blown out of proportion. He said Patel won’t use the FBI to pursue enemies and that his public comments are bluster intended to support Trump.\n“He’s not gonna go after anyone, he’s going to go in there and focus the bureau on crime, going after the cartels and doing the work they should be doing,” the former colleague said.\nIt remains to be seen whether Patel will pass the confirmation vote in the Senate. But if he does, Patel will have positioned himself to act both as Trump’s shield – protecting him and his allies from the so-called deep state – and as Trump’s sword, using the country’s most powerful law enforcement agency to do his bidding.\n",

    "content": "A man is being questioned in the fatal shooting nearly a week ago of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO in New York City after he was found Monday in Pennsylvania with a gun and a suppressor like those used in the homicide, law enforcement officials briefed on the situation tell CNN.\nHe has been arrested on charges tied to the gun, a law enforcement official said. The weapon is a ghost gun – an untraceable, homemade weapon – another law enforcement source told CNN.\nRelated live-story\nPolice questioning man in connection with UnitedHealthcare CEO’s killing\nThe 26-year-old was picked up at a McDonald’s in Altoona after an employee thought he resembled the man in New York Police Department photos and called police, the officials said. He also had fake IDs, including one the NYPD believes was used by the suspect in New York, they said.\nFOLLOW LIVE UPDATES\nPolice in Altoona – about 280 miles from the Midtown Manhattan hotel where UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was fatally shot – responded to the call, picked up the man and searched him, the sources said.\nThe man also had a two-page document railing against the health care industry and suggesting violence is the answer, a police official who has seen the document told CNN.\nAltoona police are waiting for NYPD detectives, who are en route.\nThe sprawling manhunt for whoever shot Thompson on December 4 has intensified as it crossed state lines: The suspect was believed to have left New York City on an interstate bus, police officials said, after video cameras captured him entering the George Washington Bridge Bus Station on 178th Street but not leaving.\nHere are other key developments:\nAuthorities have known what the suspect looks like but not who or where he is. Over the weekend, they released new photos of him: in the backseat of a taxi and wearing a jacket while walking on the street. In both, he wears a hood and a face mask.\nThrough glimpses of his unmasked face, his movements through the country’s largest city and the belongings police say he discarded, he seems almost familiar but remains a mystery.\nRelated article\nWhy finding the suspected CEO killer is harder than you might think\nThe public, too, has seen the suspect in surveillance photos and videos, including one with him pointing the weapon at Thompson’s back.\nGiven the suspect’s missteps – and further mistakes he could make – learning his identity will likely help determine patterns that lead to his capture, experts told CNN.\nA determination of the suspect’s identity should come soon, former FBI profiler Mary Ellen O’Toole said before Monday’s developments in Altoona.\n“I’m thinking we’re going to know who this is within a matter of a few more days, if that,” she told CNN. “He’s completely outnumbered. With that kind of manpower behind their efforts, they’re going to come up with the information that identifies him.”\nThe suspect made missteps before and after the attack that could lead authorities to finding him, experts say.\n“The ability to stand up against that kind of an investigation, one person can’t do it, no matter how arrogant you are,” O’Toole said. “You’re bound to make mistakes.”\nSome of the suspect’s actions – such as pulling his mask down on camera and leaving behind inscribed shell casings that may point to a motive, a burner phone and a partial fingerprint on a water bottle – only added to the clues left behind for authorities.\nPolice also traced his movements before the shooting via a Greyhound bus originating in Atlanta and bound for New York City.\n“The thing that works against the shooter is that law enforcement will get better, but the shooter can’t go back and undo what he’s already done,” O’Toole said.\nThe shooter appears to have perhaps only practiced such a killing before, rather than being an experienced assassin, O’Toole said. Leaving shell casings or Monopoly money behind for authorities would not typically align with the actions of a killer who wanted “to blend back into oblivion,” she said.\nPolice continue to look into whether words found on the casings – “Delay, deny, defend,” said NYPD Chief Detective Joseph Kenny – may point to a motive. A 2010 book critiquing the insurance industry is titled, “Delay Deny Defend,” a common description of its tactics.\nMinimizing the number of actions a fugitive takes before and after a crime is crucial to avoid getting caught, said Peter Young, a former FBI fugitive who evaded capture for more than seven years on terrorism charges related to releases of animals from fur farms.\n“It sounds like this person did not adhere to that,” Young told CNN. “If he was stopping at Starbucks, that sounds like an unnecessary risk.”\nAfter several days of evading capture by the FBI, New York Police Department and other agencies, the psychological pressure of being on the run and the focus of a widespread search could lead to errors, O’Toole said.\nRelated article\nA man, a bike and a gun: Police search for evidence to solve the killing of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO on the streets of New York\n“It would be absolutely overwhelming and there’s nothing that he can do about it, and this is where he will make mistakes,” she said. “In the shoes of the shooter right now, he is dealing with emotions and consequences that I don’t think he anticipated at all.”\nIt’s possible the suspect could lose the critical thinking skills needed to strategically evade capture under the mounting pressure, the expert said.\n“His options are getting fewer and fewer and fewer, and then on top of that, his ability to make good decisions is deteriorating,” O’Toole said.\n“(With) the reality that he can never go back to a normal life the way it was before last week, all of those can result in very poor decision-making,” she added.\nAs investigators zero in on the suspect and his identity, they will be able to examine details about his life that could be crucial to the case, O’Toole said.\nRelated video\nRetired NYPD captain describes ‘unique weapon’ that may have been used in CEO shooting\n“They’ll be looking for his patterns of behavior,” she said. “You start looking at, ‘Where does he work? Where does he go after work? Does he work out in the gym? Does he walk his family dog?’\n“It’s really difficult for us to break every pattern of behavior that we depend on in our lives, so eventually you default to going into Starbucks to get your coffee, or you default to getting up at 6 o’clock in the morning and going for a run,” she added.\nThe morning before the shooting, the suspect was spotted ordering a bottle of water and two energy bars from Starbucks, images released by authorities show.\nNew photos released early Sunday by the FBI and the NYPD show the hooded suspect wearing dark clothing while sitting in the back of a taxi, his face partially covered in a blue mask as his eyes appear to stare directly into the cab’s camera.\nSimilar photos show him outside the taxi, appearing to walk down the street.\nCNN’s Evan Perez, Shimon Prokupecz and Ryan Young contributed to this report.\n",

    "content": "China has opened an antitrust investigation into American chipmaker Nvidia, the world’s largest provider of processors that power artificial intelligence, according to Chinese state media.\nThe probe serves as the latest escalation of a growing battle for AI dominance, which both the United States and China believe is crucial for national security.\nChina Central Television in a report Monday said the Chinese government believes Nvidia’s purchase of Israeli networking company Mellanox could violate the country’s anti-monopoly laws, though the report did not specify what the merger did to potentially break the law. China approved the acquisition in 2020.\nNvidia (NVDA) shares fell less than 2% in premarket trading Monday. The stock is among the hottest on the market, surging nearly 200% this year as the AI boom has fueled demand for the company’s chips. Its market value is more than $3 trillion, second only to Apple.\nThe tit-for-tat China-US chip war has entered a new phase this month, after the Biden administration imposed another round of restrictions on high tech memory chip sales to China a week ago. The memory chips are different than the graphics processors Nvidia makes, but they are also crucial technology that helps power AI.\nThe administration’s new export controls are the third such round of chip sales restrictions to China. The United States fears that China could use AI to gain a military advantage, and US Commerce Department officials said they believed the restrictions would slow China’s development of AI chips — and industry experts believe the US government’s plan will work.\nBut China’s Commerce Ministry lambasted the United States’ restrictions, saying they pose “a significant threat” to the stability of global supply chains. China’s government retaliated last week by banning the sale of materials essential for manufacturing the chips, including germanium and gallium.\nA year ago, China had curbed the sale of those materials but created loopholes that allowed for some sales to continue. Those have now been closed.\nSenior US officials have also accused China of stealing American-made AI software, which Beijing denies.\nThe Nvidia investigation ups the ante. The company is the face of the AI tech revolution and hurting Nvidia could harm the American company’s ambitions to continue to power AI around the world.\nNvidia is also under antitrust scrutiny in the United States, according to Bloomberg.\nIn addition to curbing materials and chips sales, both China and the United States are trying to bolster their own development and manufacturing of microprocessors at home.\nThrough the CHIPS Act, the Biden administration has pumped billions of dollars into Intel and other companies to boost domestic production of chips and reduce America’s reliance on China and other foreign countries for the technology. Meanwhile, China in May announced plans to set up its largest-ever semiconductor state investment fund worth $47.5 billion, funded by investments from six of the country’s largest state-owned banks.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments and context.\nCNN’s Fred He, Juliana Liu, Sean Lyngaas, Wayne Chang and Rosa de Acosta contributed to this report.\n",

    "content": "A word that has been used incessantly to describe the fraught state of American politics and society is Merriam-Webster’s 2024 word of the year. That word is “polarization.”\nDefined as a “division into two sharply distinct opposites,” “polarization” grew dramatically in search volume over the past year due to what the online dictionary site claims was the “desire of Americans to better understand the complex state of affairs.”\n“Polarization” was widely used across the media, with MSNBC at one point declaring that “the 2024 US presidential has left our country more polarized than ever.” Forbes, meanwhile, warned that in workplaces, “cultural polarization is becoming a pressing challenge,” Merriam-Webster wrote in announcing the selection.\n“The online dictionary tells us which words are being looked up, but also in what volume. And so we try to have a data driven list that explains what words sent people to the dictionary in the past year,” Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster editor at large, told the Associated Press.\n“This year was a year with an important election. The elections were clearly the story of the year,” he said. “And polarization is the term that has been used by everyone.”\nOther contenders for word of the year included “totality,” following an April solar eclipse that drew astronomical excitement, and “fortnight,” the primarily British word that’s also a Taylor Swift song.\nMerriam-Webster is one of the final few English-language dictionary platforms to release its annual word. Earlier in December, Oxford Dictionary announced that “brain rot” was its word of the year, while Cambridge Dictionary declared “manifest” its lead word for 2024.\nMeanwhile, Dictionary.com’s word of the year was “demure,” which saw a “meteoric rise in usage” this year following the release of satirical make-up videos by transgender TikToker Jools Lebron.\n",

    "publishedAt": "12:38 PM EST, Sun December 8, 2024",
    "content": "President-elect Donald Trump said in an interview that aired on Sunday that he has no plans to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.\nAppearing on NBC’s “Meet the Press with Kristen Welker,” Trump was asked if he would try to replace Powell.\n“No, I don’t think so. I don’t see it,” Trump said. “I think if I told him to, he would. But if I asked him to, he probably wouldn’t. But if I told him to, he would.”\nWelker followed by asking Trump if he had plans to ask Powell to resign. Trump responded, “No, I don’t.”\nThe comments mark the first time since the presidential election that Trump has publicly backed Powell. In July, Trump said he would not fire Powell if he won the election and in November, a senior adviser to Trump reaffirmed that Trump would likely allow Powell would finish his term as chairman.\nTrump, however, has threatened to remove Powell from his post on several occasions after the central bank raised interest rates in 2018 and even called Powell “the enemy” in 2019. In March 2020, Trump told reporters he had the “right to remove (Powell) as chairman” and that “he has, so far, made a lot of bad decisions, in my opinion,” after markets tanked amid the pandemic. But he also praised Powell for cutting rates to zero to prevent an economic collapse.\nTrump nominated Powell to serve as head of the US central bank in November 2017. Powell was later reappointed by President Joe Biden to serve another term.\nBarely 48 hours passed after Trump’s election before a reporter asked Powell if he’d resign if Trump asked him to. Powell responded that he would not.\n“Not permitted under the law,” Powell repeated twice.\nThere are legal barriers for Trump, and any other president, to remove or fire a Fed chair. It requires what America’s central bank refers to as “for cause.”\nUltimately, the Supreme Court could have the final say on what merits a “for cause” firing of a Fed chair. But while that fight, which would probably be lengthy, plays out, Powell would likely still get to stay in his job until his term ends.\nTrump had accused Powell of being “political,” and said that the Fed has considered rate cuts “for the sake of maybe getting people elected” in a February interview with Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo.\nTrump has also said that his threats to remove Powell were because interest rates were too high, but the Fed chair went too far by cutting rates “too much.”\nTrump has also shared another plan if he can’t fire Powell: getting the central bank to consult him on interest rate decisions.\n“I feel the president should have at least a say in there. I feel that strongly,” Trump said at a news conference in August about the Fed’s interest rate decisions. “I made a lot of money. I was very successful. And I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve — or the chairman.”\nThe Fed is intended to be an independent governing body free from political influence so that it doesn’t make decisions that could upset the scale of job creation and low inflation.\nIt’s unclear whether Trump would need congressional approval to take away the Fed’s independence. Either way, Powell is against the idea, and told reporters in September that independent central banks typically have lower inflation.\n“It’s a good institutional arrangement, which has been good for the public, and I hope and strongly believe that it will continue,” he said.\nCNN’s Elisabeth Buchwald, Bryan Mena and Kayla Tausche contributed to this report.\n",

Aircraft will be reconfigured to replace the existing first two rows with the new seats, the airline told CNN. Pricing details are not yet available.\nThe airline joins struggling rival Spirit Airlines in creating a new premium offering. Spirit rolled out premium “Go Big” bundles over the summer allowing passengers to pay extra for tickets that include items such as snacks, drinks, free bags and priority check-in along with its wider seats.\nThe latest move by Frontier is another sign of the difficulty budget airlines have had making money on no-frills tickets.\nThe carriers are falling in line with the industry trend toward an array of premium products — for an added price.\nSouthwest Airlines announced in July that it would eventually do away with its longstanding open seating policy — allowing it to charge a premium for certain seats with extra legroom.\nFrontier’s new premium seating announcement comes alongside other changes the carrier is implementing as part of a multi-pronged overhaul it is calling The New Frontier.\n“We’ve listened to customers, and they want more — more premium options, like first class-style seating, attainable seat upgrades, more free travel for their companions, and the ability to use miles on more than just airfare,” said CEO Barry Biffle, in a statement.\nEnhanced loyalty benefits were also announced on Tuesday, including free seat upgrades for Elite loyalty members, free companion travel for some status levels and the ability to redeem miles for bags and seat bundles.

    "content": "If it wasn’t clear before, it is now: President-elect Donald Trump plans to boost the cryptocurrency industry while continuing a broad antitrust crackdown on Big Tech giants such as Amazon, Meta and Google.\nThat combination would appear to reward Trump’s wealthiest and most influential donors in Silicon Valley, some of whom have specifically called for less regulation of crypto and weakening the power of large tech monopolies.\nIn short, it’s the venture capitalist tech agenda.\nOn Wednesday, Trump said he plans to nominate Paul Atkins to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission and Gail Slater to head the Justice Department’s antitrust division, two key appointments that will heavily influence his administration’s relationship with the tech sector.\nAtkins is a crypto advocate and a co-chairman of the Token Alliance at the Digital Chamber, a major blockchain trade association. Slater, an economic adviser to Vice President-elect JD Vance, served in the first Trump White House. Earlier in her career, Slater spent more than a decade working on antitrust investigations and technology policy as a staffer at the Federal Trade Commission.\nTrump’s choices here may be more obscure than some of his earlier, higher-profile picks such as former US Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general or former Fox News host Pete Hegseth for secretary of defense. But they could have a huge impact – not just on the price of bitcoin, which surged past $100,000 on Wednesday in anticipation of a crypto-friendly administration, but also on the future of the digital economy writ large.\n“This is very much a kind of industrial policy, with some areas getting deeper scrutiny and others a lighter touch based on a particular vision of how to steer the market,” said Gene Kimmelman, a former DOJ antitrust official.\nIn announcing his picks this week, Trump signaled a pivot away from the strong cryptocurrency regulation favored by President Joe Biden’s SEC Chair, Gary Gensler. And he indicated that large tech platforms will continue to face tough US scrutiny by antitrust regulators with Slater at the helm.\n“Big Tech has run wild for years,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, “stifling competition in our most innovative sector and, as we all know, using its market power to crack down on the rights of so many Americans, as well as those of Little Tech! I was proud to fight these abuses in my First Term, and our Department of Justice’s antitrust team will continue that work under Gail’s leadership.”\nTrump’s deliberate nod to “Little Tech” is likely to please influential tech investors Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, who, during the campaign, elevated the term and donated millions to a pro-Trump super PAC.\nTrump’s offhand usage of the phrase shows the significant and perhaps growing sway that some in venture capital now seem to enjoy within Trump’s orbit – reflected as well by Vance’s own background as a one-time venture capitalist and the lengths to which Peter Thiel, the right-wing tech billionaire and PayPal co-founder, went to promote Vance’s entry into politics.\nIn July, Andreessen and Horowitz — founders of the famed tech investment firm Andreessen Horowitz, or a16z — outlined a “Little Tech Agenda” that attacked regulatory scrutiny of crypto-related businesses, argued tech monopolists were stifling the startup ecosystem and called for “a whole-of-government program” to promote US technological supremacy.\n“Little Tech is our term for tech startups, as contrasted to Big Tech incumbents,” they wrote. “We believe bad government policies are now the #1 threat to Little Tech.”\nTheir critique derived from a self-described manifesto published the year before, in which Andreessen decried “regulatory capture” by large monopolies. He also identified a long list of perceived “enemies” to human progress that included corporate social responsibility, risk management, trust and safety, tech ethics and sustainability.\nThose who subscribe to those “zombie ideas” are “suffering from ressentiment – a witches’ brew of resentment, bitterness, and rage that is causing them to hold mistaken values,” Andreessen wrote. “We believe we must help them find their way out of their self-imposed labyrinth of pain.”\nAndreessen’s prescription? Let unfettered markets create more technology, because technology can fix all of society’s ills, if only the short-sighted would get out of its way.\n“We believe that there is no material problem – whether created by nature or by technology – that cannot be solved with more technology,” Andreessen wrote.\nNow, Trump seems poised to deliver exactly what Andreessen asked for: freedom from regulation for one of the tech industry’s shiniest objects and the threat of further antitrust headaches for the most dominant tech platforms.\nThere is little doubt among antitrust experts that Slater would pick up where the Biden DOJ left off on tech competition lawsuits. Slater would inherit two ongoing monopoly cases against Google; a monopoly case against Apple; a monopoly case against LiveNation, the parent of Ticketmaster; and a monopoly case against Visa. It was Trump’s first DOJ that sued Google in 2020 over allegations it had monopolized the online search market, a monumental claim that a federal judge agreed with in a blockbuster ruling this summer.\n“I anticipate significant continuity with the program launched by (Trump’s first administration) and carried forward by the Biden administration — especially for the large tech enterprises,” said William Kovacic, a former chair of the Federal Trade Commission. Kovacic described Slater as “a superb candidate” who is “a highly respected expert in competition law and policy.”\nKimmelman agreed, saying Slater has “excellent credentials and a background in antitrust enforcement” who will “bring a very serious enforcement mindset.”\nStarting his administration talking tough on Big Tech could yield dividends for Trump later, Kimmelman added, depending on the extent to which Trump tries to use the Justice Department as a weapon against his enemies, as he has pledged to do, or as a clearinghouse for political favors, in a departure from longstanding norms.\n“The wild card for antitrust will be how much the White House directly intervenes in enforcement matters,” Kimmelman said. “We can expect corporate CEOs to curry favor as best they can with the White House in the hopes they get better regulatory and enforcement treatment. Time will tell how that plays out.”\nAtkins, meanwhile, is widely expected to pursue the types of pro-crypto policies that he has spent his time promoting as a private citizen. Last year, for example, Atkins argued on a podcast that if the SEC took a more “accommodating” approach to crypto firms and exchanges, it would be easier for Americans to use those platforms, which might cut down on the use of foreign-owned exchanges or the use of complicated, potentially risky workarounds to access them.\nTrump himself has embraced crypto, despite earlier calling it a “scam.” In addition to wooing the crypto industry and crypto-friendly megadonors, Trump now has his own stake in the digital assets sector. In September, he and his family launched a cryptocurrency business. In 2022, he also raised eyebrows by attempting to sell virtual trading cards, an apparent attempt at cashing in on the short-lived popularity of nonfungible tokens.\nAtkins is a former SEC commissioner who served a six-year stint at the agency during the presidency of George W. Bush.\nHis nomination had another a16z partner, Chris Dixon, applauding on Wednesday.\n“Congratulations to Paul Atkins on his nomination as SEC Chair. We are very optimistic about the opportunities under Mr. Atkin’s leadership to accelerate progress and allow crypto to thrive in the U.S.,” Dixon wrote on X, punctuating his message with an American flag emoji.\n",

    "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n(CNN) — President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for NASA administrator — tech billionaire and spaceflight trailblazer Jared Isaacman — is sending shock waves through the space community, eliciting excited responses from industry leaders who view Isaacman as a changemaker as well as concerns about conflicts of interest.\nIsaacman, who has twice traveled to space on private missions and has close ties to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk but lacks experience in government or academia, is an unorthodox selection.\nNASA administrators are typically selected from a pool of scientists, engineers, academics or public servants.\nIsaacman’s association with the space world, however, derives mostly from his extensive partnership with SpaceX, as a customer and collaborator.\nThose ties are notable because NASA is relying on the commercial sector — and SpaceX specifically — more than ever, as the federal agency is drastically increasing the amount of work it contracts out to companies.\nSome industry professionals hailed Isaacman’s selection as a “perfect pick,” as Isaac Arthur, the president of the nonprofit National Space Society, which advocates for human spaceflight, put it in a statement.\n“He brings a wealth of experience in entrepreneurial enterprise as well as unique knowledge in working with both NASA and SpaceX, a perfect combination as we enter a new era of increased cooperation between NASA and commercial spaceflight,” Arthur said.\nGarrett Reisman, a former NASA astronaut who is now a SpaceX senior adviser, also applauded the selection, calling Isaacman an “excellent choice” who will “push NASA to go further and faster.”\nIf Isaacman’s nomination is confirmed by the US Senate, he will take over the agency at a crucial time as NASA gears up to attempt the first crewed moon landing in more than five decades under its Artemis program.\nRelated article\nNASA delays first crewed flight to the moon in over 50 years\n“The next 4 years at NASA are going to be real interesting!” said Reisman, who has also openly voiced his opposition to Trump.\nThough Isaacman’s rise in the space world hasn’t been traditional, his record may offer some clues as to what could lie in store should he land the space agency’s top role.\nIsaacman, 41, is the CEO of Shift4 Payments, which he founded in 1999 at the age of 16. An experienced jet pilot, Isaacman also founded and ran a defense contractor company, called Draken International, that aided training for the Air Force in the 2010s.\nIn recent years, however, Isaacman has garnered international attention for his focus on space.\nIsaacman and three crewmates from various walks of life spent three days in 2021 flying aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule for a mission dubbed Inspiration4 that Isaacman self-funded. It marked the first spaceflight crewed entirely by civilians — or otherwise nongovernment astronauts — ever to venture to Earth’s orbit.\nIsaacman has since expanded his partnership with SpaceX to include a development program called Polaris. The first of three missions planned under that effort — Polaris Dawn — took flight in September. The mission made history by sending Isaacman and three crewmates, including two SpaceX engineers, on the first-ever commercial spacewalk.\nIf confirmed, Isaacman would be only the fourth of 15 NASA administrators to have actually traveled to space.\nIsaacman’s close ties with SpaceX and Musk are likely to raise questions about conflicts of interest. At the helm of NASA, he will oversee billions of dollars’ worth of contracts that the space agency holds with SpaceX and the company’s direct competitors, including Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin.\nIsaacman would also likely preside over the review and certification of SpaceX’s Starship, the gargantuan rocket and spacecraft system that NASA plans to use to ferry astronauts to the lunar surface under its Artemis program. Isaacman also plans to ride aboard the vehicle himself as part of his Polaris program.\nPresident-elect Trump’s closeness with Elon Musk is raising concerns over conflicts of interest when it comes to Musk’s businesses. CNN’s Ed Lavandera has more.\nRelated video\nTrump joins Elon Musk to watch latest SpaceX test flight\nNotably, Isaacman also has a financial stake in SpaceX. His company, Shift4 — in which he personally owns a 30% stake — purchased $27.5 million worth of SpaceX shares in February 2021, according to financial documents. As of June, Shift4 reported $10.8 million in gains from the investment.\nIn an email to Shift4 employees, Isaacman said on Wednesday he plans to “retain the majority of my equity interest in Shift4, subject to ethics obligations” if he is confirmed to the NASA post.\nDespite Isaacman’s close relationship with Musk, the two have adopted starkly different tones regarding politics.\nMusk, who campaigned for Trump and is slated to lead an effort to slash government spending and regulation by co-leading a presidential advisory commission called the Department of Government Efficiency, has taken a strong turn toward conservative politics and routinely makes incendiary comments on social media.\nIsaacman, meanwhile, has aimed to position himself as a more neutral party.\n“I respect people’s passionate views on emotionally charged topics like politics, but I am anchored in the center and will always aim to be a unifier rather than a divider,” he wrote in a November 6 post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that Musk purchased in 2022.\nIsaacman, however, has also been known to defend and praise Musk on social media, asking people to overlook Musk’s more controversial positions and appreciate the work that SpaceX has done.\n“I don’t need to have a public opinion on his politics because there is much more to the man and his companies,” Isaacman said of Musk in an October 11 post. “What I care about are the enormous world changing problems Elon and his companies are working to solve and generally, how I can help.”\nIsaacman’s efforts to convey an apolitical agenda aligns with how NASA administrators of the past have sought to position themselves. Effectively leading the $25 billion agency — and securing funding for projects NASA hopes to accomplish — routinely requires the agency’s chief to work with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.\nStill, Isaacman’s position at the head of NASA would no doubt spur critics who may paint Isaacman as a Musk crony, installed to advance SpaceX’s interests as the federal agency doles out lucrative contracts.\nFor his part, however, Bezos said on Wednesday that he did not believe Musk would use his proximity to Trump or position within the president-elect’s transition team to give SpaceX an edge over Blue Origin.\n“They’re (SpaceX) certainly very good competitors, no doubt about that. … I take at face value what has been said, which is that (Musk) is not going to use his political power to advantage his own companies or to disadvantage his competitors, I take that at  face value,” Bezos said Wednesday at the New York Times DealBook Summit. “Again, I could be wrong about that, but I think it could be true.”\nBezos did not directly address Isaacman’s nomination.\nBut Isaacman has shared some of his ideas about NASA policy and how the space agency should dole out contract dollars — and some of them directly involve Blue Origin.\nOn social media, Isaacman has criticized NASA’s decision to invest in two companies to develop two separate lunar landers: SpaceX’s Starship and Blue Origin’s Blue Moon.\nNASA’s goal in paying for the private sector to develop two competing vehicles that can accomplish the same task is to provide a safeguard for the space agency’s goals of putting boots on the moon amid an international space race: Should one lunar lander or the other malfunction or get bogged down in development delays, the space agency is not left without an alternative option.\nIsaacman has criticized that approach, however, and advocated for keeping only one lunar lander provider to save NASA money that could be reallocated to other science missions.\n“Spend billions on lunar lander redundancy … at the expense of dozens of scientific programs,” Isaacman posted in March. “I don’t like it.”\nCurrent NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said during a news conference Thursday that he did not believe Isaacman would or could cancel a lunar lander contract.\n“We have contracts with two companies for landers,” Nelson said. “As long as we’re a nation of the rule of law, those contracts are going to be operative, and we expect those companies to perform on their contracts.”\nNelson also said that he has a positive view about the relationship between Trump and Musk: “Understand that I am an optimist by nature. But in this particular case, I think that the relationship between Elon Musk and the president-elect is going to be a benefit to making sure that the funding for NASA is there.”\nFurther speculation has questioned whether the new Trump administration may opt to cancel NASA’s Space Launch System, or SLS — a rocket that has long been over budget and plagued by delays. SLS is designed to launch astronauts from Earth before they are later transferred to a lunar lander — i.e., Starship or Blue Moon — to touch down on the moon’s surface.\nIsaacman has not publicly addressed those rumors, though he has called SLS “outrageously expensive” and the result of a “government (that is) lousy at capital allocation.”\nRelated article\nElon Musk has pledged to settle Mars. A prize-winning book offers a reality check\nMore broadly, Isaacman has described his overall vision for the future of humanity in space as one that aligns closely with that of SpaceX: permanent extraterrestrial settlements that allow people to visit, live and work on other worlds such as Mars.\n“I think SpaceX is on — for our time — the most incredible adventure imaginable,” Isaacman told CNN in an August interview. “It’s not just about Mars. … It’s actually the possibility of unlocking life’s mysteries. Where did we really come from? What is our purpose?”\n",

    "content": "The recent reversals by two US district judges on plans to step down from their seats, effectively denying President-elect Donald Trump the opportunity to replace them, has put attention on other judges slated to create prized appellate vacancies but who could have a change of heart now that its clear President Joe Biden won’t choose their successors.\nIn a scathing speech this week, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell lambasted the “two partisan Democrat district judges” who had “unretired.” The Kentucky Republican warned that there could be consequences for them and for the appellate judges in question if they also backtrack on their plans to step aside.\n“This sort of partisan behavior undermines the integrity of the judiciary. It exposes bold Democratic blue where there should only be black robes,” said McConnell, who played a pivotal role in confirming scores of Trump nominees, including three Supreme Court justices. “It’s hard to conclude that this is anything other than open partisanship.”\nRelated article\nTakeaways from the historic transgender care arguments at the Supreme Court\nUS District Judge Algenon Marbley, who had announced last year plans to enter so-called senior status upon the confirmation of his successor, told the White House days after Trump’s election that he was rescinding those intentions. (Senior status is when a judge serves in a semi-retired capacity, allowing them to still help out with cases while creating a vacancy for their seat to be filled.)\n“A successor has not been confirmed, and I have therefore decided to remain on active status and carry out the full duties and obligations of the office,” Marbley, an appointee of President Bill Clinton who sits in the Southern District of Ohio, said in a November 8 letter obtained by CNN. “Please accept this letter as a formal withdrawal of my intention to assume senior status.”\nA second judge, Judge Max Cogburn – a Western District of North Carolina judge appointed by President Barack Obama – also informed the White House he was backtracking on his retirement plans, Reuters reported last week. His chambers did not respond to CNN’s request for comment, but, sometime between November 1 and December 1, his name was removed from the list of future vacancies maintained by the administrative office of the judicial branch.\nFederal judges are confirmed for lifetime tenures, and it’s entirely in their discretion when to retire, according to John P. Collins, a professor at George Washington Law School who focuses on judicial nominations. Collins suggested that the two judges may have been wary of the types of nominees Trump would put forward, particularly given his allies’ suggestions that they’d select judges even farther to the right than in his first term as well as Trump’s floating of the use of recess appointments – a process that sidesteps Senate approval.\n“I can imagine a judge thinking, no matter the party that appointed them the first time, that this is not the person I want to give the power to choose my successor to,” Collins said.\nA handful of judges in recent years have also reversed retirement plans when they have not been able to secure a preferred successor, including US District Judge Karen Caldwell, a judge who sits in McConnell’s home state. She changed her plans to step down after a deal between the Biden White House and McConnell to replace her with a conservative lawyer fell apart.\nCogburn and Marbley are also not the first judges to back off retirement plans after an election. As McConnell himself highlighted, a district judge did the same about-face after President George W. Bush’s reelection in 2004, and another changed his retirement plans when Obama won in 2008.\nBiden had not named nominees to replace Cogburn and Marbley. For any Biden nominee for those district court vacancies to go forward they would have needed the support of the Republican senators from North Carolina and Ohio, under a Senate tradition known as blue slips.\nBut Biden did nominate replacements for 6th US Circuit Judge Jane Branstetter Stranch and 4th US Circuit Judge James Andrew Wynn, the two appeals court judges McConnell is apparently worried about.\nLeaving those vacancies open for Trump was key to a deal the Senate GOP reached with Democrats last month that cleared the way for Biden to see a dozen-or-so of his pending district court nominees confirmed before the end of the year. Under the agreement, Republicans ended procedural maneuvers that were stymieing the confirmation of those nominees and in exchange, Democrats would not try to confirm Biden picks for four circuit seats, including for the seats set to be vacated by Stranch and Wynn.\n“Never before has a circuit judge unretired after a presidential election,” McConnell said Monday. “It’s literally unprecedented. And to create such a precedent would fly in the face of a rare bipartisan compromise on the disposition of these vacancies.”\nMcConnell suggested that the Trump Justice Department could seek the recusal of those judges if cases involving the incoming administration landed in their courts, and he warned that those kinds of recusal requests, as well as ethics complaints, would come the way of the appellate judges if they follow Marbley and Cogburn’s example.\nNeither Wynn nor Stranch, when announcing their plans to step aside, had indicated a set date on which they would take on senior status. That means that they could still change their plans in light of the current circumstances.\nSenate Democrats noted Monday evening that McConnell reportedly urged GOP appointed judges to step down in the months before the 2020 election.\n“Senator McConnell has no room to talk when it comes to judges deciding if and when to retire,” the Senate Judiciary Committee said in X post.\nCollins put the odds of Stranch and Wynn changing their plans at more than 50%, as he pointed to those judges’ backstories.\nRelated article\nTakeaways from Trump’s victories over special counsel Jack Smith\nWynn, an Obama appointee, was first selected for the appeals court by Clinton in 1999, but was stalled for several years after his home state senator, late Republican Sen. Jesse Helms, of North Carolina, withheld support. Meanwhile, the Biden nominee to replace Stranch was her former clerk, Karla Campbell, who attracted pointed Republican criticism due to her work with a labor rights group.\nBoth Campbell and Ryan Park, the nominee picked to replace Wynn, faced opposition from their home state GOP senators, but Republicans under Trump ended the blue slip tradition for circuit nominees, meaning that opposition was not on its own enough to block the nominees.\nCNN’s messages seeking comment from the two judges submitted with the judges’ courts were not returned.\nRussell Wheeler – a non-resident fellow in the Brookings Institution’s Governance Studies program who studies federal judicial selection – said McConnell had “weak moral ground to stand on,” given his tactics on judicial confirmations, which included a blockade of Obama nominees all the way up to an Obama pick for the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland.\nBut, Wheeler said that McConnell “may be having the effect he wants” if the two appellate judges are “wavering” about whether to keep to their retirement plans.\n",

    "content": "President-elect Donald Trump in a television interview that aired Sunday previewed a sweeping agenda for his first days in office, outlining how his administration will prioritize deporting migrants with criminal records, vowing to pursue pardons for January 6 defendants on his first day, and raising the possibility that former Rep. Liz Cheney and other political opponents could face jail time.\nAt the same time, Trump said he’s open to working with Democrats to preserve the legal status of “Dreamers” — an often-used term for immigrants who were brought to the US as children — even as he stood by campaign pledges of mass deportations and ending birthright citizenship.\n“We have to do something about the Dreamers, because these are people that have been brought here at a very young age, and many of these are middle-aged people now. They don’t even speak the language of their country. And yes, we’re going to do something about that,” Trump said in a “Meet the Press” interview with NBC’s Kristen Welker that taped Friday, his first broadcast sit-down since he was elected.\n“I will work with the Democrats on a plan, and if we can come up with a plan — but the Democrats have made it very, very difficult to do anything. Republicans are very open to the Dreamers,” he added.\nlive updates\nThe latest on Trump’s presidential transition\nTrump had previously expressed some support for protecting Dreamers during his first term, although his administration tried to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that protects them from deportation. That attempt was blocked by the Supreme Court in 2020.\nTrump said his administration’s mass deportation efforts will target people with criminal histories, but indicated it could go beyond deporting criminals — without specifying who the “other people outside of criminals” would be. When asked whether he plans to deport every person who has entered the country illegally, he said, “I think you have to do it.”\n“It’s a very tough thing to do,” he said, adding, “you know, you have rules, regulations, laws. They came in illegally.”\nAsked about families with mixed immigration status — where parents are in the country illegally but their children are not — Trump said, “I don’t want to be breaking up families, so the only way you don’t break up the family is you keep them together, and you have to send them all back.”\nTrump also doubled down on his campaign promise to end birthright citizenship, which is protected by the 14th Amendment, and suggested he may attempt to overturn the right through executive action.\n“We’re gonna have to get it changed, or maybe I would go back to the people, but we have to end it. We’re the only country that has it,” he said, echoing a false statement he’s made in the past. “If we can, through executive action. I was going to do it through executive action, but then we had to fix Covid first, to be honest with you.”\nAs CNN has reported, about three dozen countries provide automatic citizenship to people born on their soil.\nTrump said he would not seek “retribution” against President Joe Biden and against his political enemies, but he repeatedly left room for his appointees to decide whether to go after specific people. He suggested members of Congress who led the investigations into his conduct during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol should be put in jail and that he’ll look on his first day at issuing pardons to supporters involved in the riot.\n“These people have been there, how long is it? Three or four years? You know, by the way, they’ve been in there for years, and they’re in a filthy, disgusting place that shouldn’t even be allowed to be open,” he said. Nearly 1,200 people either have pleaded guilty or were found guilty at trial for crimes connected to the January 6 attack, according to the Justice Department. More than 645 defendants were ordered to serve some jail time.\nTrump said he would not direct his Justice Department to investigate members of Congress and Biden administration officials who led the investigations into his role in January 6, but continued to suggest his DOJ would be justified in deciding to launch investigations without his input.\nRelated article\nFact check: Trump, repeating old lies on ‘Meet the Press,’ falsely claims US is the only country with birthright citizenship\nWhen asked about the possibility of investigating special counsel Jack Smith, who brought the two since-dropped federal cases against him, Trump said he wants his pick for attorney general, Pam Bondi, to “do what she wants to do.”\n“She’s very experienced. I want her to do what she wants to do. I’m not going to instruct her to do it,” he said.\nTrump was more direct when speaking about the members of Congress who led the January 6 committee, telling Welker that the co-chairs of the committee — Republican Cheney, who has since left Congress, and Democrat Bennie Thompson — should “go to jail.”\n“Cheney was behind it. So is Bennie Thompson and everybody on that committee,” he said. “For what they did, honestly, they should go to jail.”\nTrump also suggested that committee members might do well to receive preemptive pardons from Biden to protect themselves from criminal prosecution. CNN reported last week that Biden White House aides, administration officials and prominent defense attorneys in Washington were discussing potential preemptive pardons or legal aid for people who might be targeted by Trump.\n“Biden can give them a pardon if he wants to,” Trump said. “And maybe he should.”\nIn a statement later Sunday, Cheney said, “Donald Trump’s suggestion that members of Congress who later investigated his illegal and unconstitutional actions should be jailed is a continuation of his assault on the rule of law and the foundations of our republic.”\nRepublican former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, who served on the committee, told CNN’s Manu Raju on Sunday he’s “not worried” about the Trump administration investigating him or his fellow committee members.\nThe Constitution’s Speech or Debate Clause protects lawmakers from certain law enforcement actions targeted at their legislative duties.\nCNN has reached out to Thompson for comment.\nPressed whether he’d direct Bondi or Kash Patel, his pick to lead the FBI, to send them to jail, Trump said, “No, not at all,” before adding, “I think they’ll have to look at that.”\nAsked whether he plans to follow up on his frequent campaign promise to investigate Biden — whom he repeatedly labeled as “corrupt” and a “criminal” on the campaign trail — Trump said he doesn’t want to “go back into the past.”\n“I’m really looking to make our country successful. I’m not looking to go back into the past,” he said, adding, “Retribution will be through success.”\nWhen asked about previously saying he would direct his Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Biden, Trump said he would not do that but left the door open for top DOJ officials to make their own determinations.\n“No, I’m not doing that unless I find something that I think is reasonable,” he said. “But that’s not going to be my decision. That’s going to be Pam Bondi’s decision, and, to a different extent, Kash Patel, assuming they’re both there, and I think they’re both going to get approved.” Trump has tapped Patel to lead the FBI, despite the current director, Trump appointee Christopher Wray, still having several years left in his 10-year term.\nThroughout the interview, Trump at times struck a more temperate tone toward his political opponents and appeared to prioritize uniting the country over exacting vengeance. He said he plans to make unity a central theme of his inauguration address and expressed confidence that his administration will achieve a level of success that will bring the country together.\nBut Trump invoked similar calls for unity at various points throughout his campaign — including in the wake of the first assassination attempt against him — before often reverting to bitter, divisive rhetoric and personal attacks. During the NBC interview, Trump again refused to concede that he lost the 2020 presidential election.\nIn the interview, Trump further previewed his plan to levy additional tariffs on three of the nation’s largest trading partners — Mexico, Canada and China. He again argued the US is “subsidizing” those countries and said tariff hikes will create a more equitable economy for the US and its allies. But Trump said he “can’t guarantee” tariffs won’t lead to increased prices on goods for Americans, as economists have suggested.\n“I can’t guarantee anything. I can’t guarantee tomorrow,” he said, before claiming that during his first presidency “we had no inflation” and that the tariffs he imposed “cost Americans nothing.” Both of these claims are false, as CNN has fact-checked.\nTrump also said he does not intend to replace Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, when he takes office.\nRelated article\nIf Trump starts a trade war with Mexico and Canada, where will Americans get all their stuff from?\nResponding to concerns that his initiative to reduce government spending, spearheaded by tech entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, could lead to cuts to entitlement programs, Trump promised not to make cuts to Social Security or raise the retirement age to begin receiving benefits. But he did say his administration would look to make the program “more efficient.”\nRamaswamy has previously said his and Musk’s initiative, the Department of Government Efficiency, would seek to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse” in entitlement programs.\nAfter tapping Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a leading vaccine skeptic who has promoted anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, as his pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, Trump said he’s open to Kennedy looking into eliminating childhood vaccines “if they’re dangerous for the children.” He then falsely suggested that vaccines have contributed to a rise in autism diagnoses, a claim that has been repeatedly debunked.\nTrump continued to tout his isolationist foreign policy agenda, teasing possible movements away from US allies in Europe. He refused to commit to keeping the US in NATO for the duration of his term, saying if NATO allies did not increase their contributions to funding the organization’s defense expenditures, he would “absolutely” consider withdrawing. And when asked whether Ukraine should prepare to receive less US aid when he takes office, Trump said “possibly, probably, sure.”\nTrump, who will be the oldest person sworn in as president, again committed to releasing his medical records, saying he has “no problem with it” and “I think anybody should.” He has previously released letters from his personal physicians outlining his health but has not released detailed accounts of his medical history.\nCNN’s Rashard Rose and Jamie Gangel contributed reporting.\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional information.\n",

    "content": "Chinese-based ByteDance and its short-video app TikTok asked an appeals court Monday to temporarily block a law that would require parent company ByteDance to divest TikTok by January 19 or face a ban in the United States, pending a review by the US Supreme Court.\nThe companies filed the emergency motion with the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, warning that without the order the law will take effect and will “shut down TikTok — one of the nation’s most popular speech platforms — for its more than 170 million domestic monthly users on the eve of a presidential inauguration.”\nOn Friday, a three-judge panel of the appeals court upheld the law requiring ByteDance to divest TikTok in the US by early next year or face a ban in just six weeks.\nLawyers for the companies said the prospect that the Supreme Court will take the case “and reverse is sufficiently high to warrant the temporary pause needed to create time for further deliberation.”\nRelated article\nWhat’s next for TikTok now that the app might get banned?\nThe companies also noted that US President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to prevent a ban, arguing the delay “will give the incoming administration time to determine its position — which could moot both the impending harms and the need for Supreme Court review.”\nTikTok also warned Monday that the court ruling would interrupt “services for tens of millions of TikTok users outside the United States.” The app said hundreds of US service providers that enable maintenance, distribution and updating would not be able to provide support for the TikTok platform starting January 19.\nThe Justice Department said the appeals court should quickly deny the TikTok’s request “to maximize the time available for the Supreme Court’s consideration” of petitions from ByteDance and TikTok.\nTikTok asked the appeals court to decide on the request by December 16.\nThe decision — unless the Supreme Court reverses it — puts TikTok’s fate in the hands of, first, President Joe Biden on whether to grant a 90-day extension of the January 19 deadline to force a sale and then of Trump, who takes office on January 20. But it is not clear whether ByteDance could meet the heavy burden to show it had made significant progress toward a divestiture needed to trigger the extension.\nTrump, who unsuccessfully tried to ban TikTok during his first term in 2020, said before the November presidential election that he would not allow the ban on TikTok.\nTrump’s incoming national security adviser Mike Waltz told Fox Business Network Friday that Trump “wants to save TikTok. We absolutely need to allow the American people to have access to that app but we have to protect our data as well.”\nThe decision upholds the law that gives the US government sweeping powers to ban other foreign-owned apps that could raise concerns about collection of Americans’ data. In 2020, Trump also tried to ban Tencent-owned WeChat but was blocked by the courts.\n",

    "content": "Russian-born American photographer Anastasia Samoylova loves “Barbie.” Not only did she wear a hot pink suit to the opening of her own photography exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in October, she also insisted on taking her teenage son to see Greta Gerwig’s 2023 film — considering it essential feminist viewing. “Is it perfect? No. But it addresses very complicated and divisive subjects,” Samoylova told CNN in a video call from her home in Florida. She recalls how Margot Robbie’s title character, Barbie, stops the euphoric dance floor in its tracks when she wonders aloud, “do you guys ever think about dying?” “That’s literally what I’ve been trying to communicate,” said Samoylova. “This is all pink and attractive, but we are going to die.”\nSamoylova, whose work is currently on display at both the Met Museum in New York and the Saatchi Gallery in London, has garnered critical acclaim for her subtle, anxiety-inducing images of Florida’s collapsing pastel-pink landscapes. Her 2019 series “Flood Zone” — a nod to the unnervingly bureaucratic label that can often dictate life or death — is a surreal chronicle of an area decaying in real time.\nCracked bubblegum-colored concrete, flooded swimming pools, uprooted palm trees and displaced alligators paint a new, unnerving picture of the climate crisis. Samoylova’s images are a far cry from the visual language of starving polar bears and blazing wildfires that often saturate converage around the environment. “Everything is intertwined,” she said. “That’s why I think isolating climate change as something detached and abstract, and visually associated with melting ice caps, is very dangerous because we’re in the moment right now. Every political decision is going to affect us on this daily basis.”\nRelated video\nPhotographer captures stunning images of ‘rivers of rust’ in Canada\nSamoylova moved to Florida in 2016, where she was struck by the state’s severe weather events and  aging infrastructure. She immediately began to document her new surroundings. Almost eight years on, “Flood Zone” feels more relevant than ever in the aftermath of Hurricane Milton, the Category 3 storm that killed more than a dozen and left more than 2.6 million Floridians without power. Milton was the third hurricane in 2024 to make landfall in the state. But Samoylova doesn’t call herself an environmental photographer. “I’m averse to labels,” she said. “I live in Miami and the choice of medium itself, to me, comes with the responsibility to reflect on our time. Otherwise, why photograph?”\nThe insidious, blink-and-you’ll-miss-it approach to her observational photography is intentional.  Several years of capturing political extremism, gentrification and environmental disintegration has given Samoylova time to think about how to package disastrous messaging. “How do you communicate these very complex subjects and make them relatable?” she asks. “The trickiest part is to not make them off-putting.” Come for the pink sidewalks that characterize the streets of Miami — as many tourists do — and stay for the subsequent feelings of existential dread. It’s a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down, she says. “(Climate change) is stigmatized, and it’s become divisive, at least where I live in the US, especially in Florida. And who knows, it’s likely going to be erased from the conversation again.”\nBut beyond providing a record of Florida in crisis, there’s also a dark poetry to her work — and plenty of space for creative interpretation. Samoylova’s favorite pastime is haunting her own gallery installations, parking herself on a viewing bench or floating between visitors like a “ghost,” and tuning in to how people are reading her pictures. “It’s the best feeling,” she said, “Leaving the work open enough to where people can discuss it on their own terms without supplying too much of a didactic narrative.”\nRelated article\nStriking photographs document environmental decay on world’s largest lake\nOne image in particular is ripe for analysis. In “Gator” (2017),  an alligator floats above the viewer, suspended in murky, acerbic green water. While Samoylova took the photo at a nature reserve, holding the lens close to the gator’s tank, there’s no real context to the animal’s surroundings. It could be anywhere — swimming through a flooded street or lying in wait beneath the surface of a flooded pool. “It’s an allegory,” said Samoylova. “Because they really do end up in people’s pools like that,” she said, adding that it felt like barely a month went by without a report of an alligator attack “But these beasts have been here forever. It’s their native habitat, so we are the ones encroaching, not them.”\nSamoylova sees something “Ballardian” in the alligator photo, which she also chose to front her business card, particularly in relation to the British author J. G. Ballard’s 1962 dystopian novel “The Drowned World” which depicts a post-apocalyptic Earth consumed by water. “(The alligator) is kind of ascending over you, and you’re already on the bottom of that reservoir,” she said. “That’s what it feels like in Florida. I mean we’re sitting here today and it’s 29 degrees (Celsius) (84 degrees Fahrenheit). This is November.”\nThe series — along with Samoylova’s own personal perspective — is not supposed to be pessimistic, however. “I remain, not really an optimist, but hopeful,” she told CNN.\nHer next project, titled “Transformations,” explores that sentiment — focusing primarily on capturing the many climate solutions already being implemented across the globe. Anything counts: From solar panels and green roofing to urban gardens and corporate initiatives.\n“We need a bit of hope,” she said.\n",

    "content": "“It should be more like pancake batter,” says Nastasia Winey, as she prepares a seed mix solution for Grasshopper - a seagrass-planting robot. Winey is a robotics engineer with ReefGen, a company that’s working to repopulate lost seagrass habitats around the globe.\nFound on seabeds from Alaska to Australia, seagrass meadows are one of the most widespread coastal habitats on Earth. While they cover just one thousandth of the ocean floor, these marine plants play an important role in aquatic ecosystems – from providing nursery grounds for marine species, to storing up to 18% of the ocean’s carbon.\nBut this vital underwater habitat is in decline – with a loss of about 7% a year globally – due to factors like coastal development, climate change, overfishing and pollution.\n“Once upon a time, there were about 18 million hectares of seagrass meadows on the planet, and we’ve lost between 30 and 40%,” says Chris Oakes, CEO of ReefGen.\nThis is a troubling statistic to Oakes, who is also a marine biologist.\n“Without the seagrass meadows, we’re going to see more coastal erosion, the loss of coral reefs, the loss of fish stocks, and degraded water quality,” he tells CNN.\nFive years ago, ReefGen was formed by Google X cofounder Tom Chi, who witnessed the decline of coral reefs close to his home in Hawaii and turned to engineering and robotics to help.\nSeagrass restoration projects often involve divers planting seeds or shoots on the ocean floor. This process can slow and low-yielding, Oakes says. It can also be risky for divers working on the sea floor for extended periods of time.\n“Manual planting works, but robots are really good when things are dull, dirty, dangerous, or distant – the four Ds,” Oakes says.\nAs technology has improved and the cost of parts has decreased over the last two decades, underwater robots have begun to play an important role in exploring and working in harsh aquatic conditions.\n“What’s amazing about where we are today in terms of robotic technology is there are a lot of off-the-shelf parts that are affordable and it allows us to start to break into these new applications, like restoration,” Oakes explains.\nReefGen first engineered a robot named Cora that plants coral plugs onto reefs to help regenerate them. Cora provided the foundation for Grasshopper – the startup’s seagrass planting iteration.\nWeighing just about 23 kilograms (50 pounds), Grasshopper – adorned with pink skis, a few cameras and a lot of tech – can currently plant up to 60 seeds per minute and can hold up to 20,000 seeds in a 20 liter bag.\nIt works by injecting the seagrass seed and mud solution, prepped beforehand, into the sediments in the seafloor.\nAfter releasing about four seeds through its planting chute, it hops around 30 centimeters over to its next injection spot, so as to not disturb its surroundings.\nGrasshopper isn’t fully autonomous just yet. It’s still piloted by a human using a controller interface on a boat, and it follows a transect line – a long measuring tape placed by a diver over the ocean floor for plotting and orientation.\n“Right now, we’re focused on the planting, the biology and the mechanical aspects,” Oakes says. “Once we’re confident that that’s all designed the right way, we will overlay more semi-autonomous features like navigation, so you don’t actually have to pilot it or lay those transect lines.”\nThe seagrass-planting robots have operated in North America, Europe and Southeast Asia. This July, Grasshopper planted 25,000 seeds in Wales.\nWhile Oakes says it takes time to see the results, he adds that their first seagrass pilot project in 2022 grew the same quality and quantity of eelgrass as the manually planted control plot. That deployment helped establish that mechanized planting, at speed and scale, is feasible.\nIn October, ReefGen teamed up with the University of North Carolina (UNC) Institute of Marine Sciences to run comparative studies looking at various seed-based seagrass restoration methods, including robotic planting.\nThe North Carolina coast is home to a large seagrass population that has been in a slow annual decline.\n“A lot of our meadows have transitioned from very contiguous features to more patchy features, so we’re really trying to explore ways to reverse those trends,” professor Joel Fodrie, director of the UNC Institute of Marine Sciences, tells CNN.\nFodrie’s team collected seeds this past spring from donor seagrass sites that had an excess and kept them in their wet lab until this fall, when they usually germinate and are ready to be planted.\n“We’ll deploy those seeds in the places that we think can grow new grass meadows, or at least, start to grow meadows again where we used to have them,” Fodrie says.\nOver the course of a few days, Grasshopper planted 1,000 seeds in a 1,000-square-meter quadrant off the coast of the southern end of the Outer Banks, which will be compared to the control sites that Fodrie’s team planted by hand.\nOakes says scientific studies like this help them extrapolate data, like how fast they can plant over time, or what to improve on for the next expedition.\n“So far, what we’re doing to collect seeds and then redeploy seeds, it still depends upon many hands,” Fodrie says, “so the ability to automate, the ability to use technology, it can certainly make things much more practical at much larger scales.”\nWhile the ReefGen team is encouraged by Grasshopper’s potential to scale up restoration, Oakes says monitoring and maintaining restored meadows will be key to ensuring success.\n“It’s important to think about restoration as an ongoing process; it’s not a one and done program – there will be more events that kill seagrass,” he says.\nTo capture change over time, ReefGen partners with companies that provide specialized in-field technology for seagrass monitoring, reporting and validation.\nOakes says local communities are central to ensuring the seagrass is cared for in the long term.\n“It’s important that we’re not just showing up with expensive robots and flashy things and saying, ‘we have all the answers,’” he says. “We’re creating more habitat for the fish, cleaner water, more jobs – everything that we want as humans; and so that’s why we want to do this, and we want to make it affordable and available.”\n",

    "content": "Guyana is revisiting a dark history nearly half a century after U.S. Rev. Jim Jones and more than 900 of his followers died in the rural interior of the South American country.\nIt was the largest suicide-murder in recent history, and a government-backed tour operator wants to open the former commune now shrouded by lush vegetation to visitors, a proposal that is reopening old wounds, with critics saying it would disrespect victims and dig up a sordid past.\nJordan Vilchez, who grew up in California and was moved into the Peoples Temple commune at age 14, told The Associated Press in a phone interview from the U.S. that she has mixed feelings about the tour.\nShe was in Guyana’s capital the day Jones ordered hundreds of his followers to drink a poisoned grape-flavored drink that was given to children first. Her two sisters and two nephews were among the victims.\n“I just missed dying by one day,” she recalled.\nVilchez, 67, said Guyana has every right to profit from any plans related to Jonestown.\n“Then on the other hand, I just feel like any situation where people were manipulated into their deaths should be treated with respect,” she said.\nVilchez added that she hopes the tour operator would provide context and explain why so many people went to Guyana trusting they would find a better life.\nThe tour would ferry visitors to the far-flung village of Port Kaituma nestled in the lush jungles of northern Guyana. It’s a trip available only by boat, helicopter or plane; rivers instead of roads connect Guyana’s interior. Once there, it’s another six miles via a rough and overgrown dirt trail to the abandoned commune and former agricultural settlement.\nNeville Bissember, a law professor at the University of Guyana, questioned the proposed tour, calling it a “ghoulish and bizarre” idea in a recently published letter.\n“What part of Guyana’s nature and culture is represented in a place where death by mass suicide and other atrocities and human rights violations were perpetuated against a submissive group of American citizens, which had nothing to do with Guyana nor Guyanese?” he wrote.\nDespite ongoing criticism, the tour has strong support from the government’s Tourism Authority and Guyana’s Tourism and Hospitality Association.\nTourism Minister Oneidge Walrond told the AP the government is backing the effort at Jonestown but is aware “of some level of pushback” from certain sectors of society.\nShe said the government already has helped clear the area “to ensure a better product can be marketed,” adding that the tour might need Cabinet approval.\n“It certainly has my support,” she said. “It is possible. After all, we have seen what Rwanda has done with that awful tragedy as an example.”\nRose Sewcharran, director of Wonderlust Adventures, the private tour operator who plans to take visitors to Jonestown, said she was buoyed by the support.\n“We think it is about time,” she said. “This happens all over the world. We have multiple examples of dark, morbid tourism around the world, including Auschwitz and the Holocaust museum.”\nRelated gallery\nThe man who takes vacations in war zones\nThe November 1978 mass suicide-murder was synonymous with Guyana for decades until huge amounts of oil and gas were discovered off the country’s coast nearly a decade ago, making it one of the world’s largest offshore oil producers.\nNew roads, schools and hotels are being built across the capital, Georgetown, and beyond, and a country that rarely saw tourists is now hoping to attract more of them.\nAn obvious attraction is Jonestown, argued Astill Paul, the co-pilot of a twin-engine plane that flew U.S. Rep. Leo J. Ryan of California and a U.S. news crew to a village near the commune a day before hundreds died on Nov. 18, 1978. He witnessed gunmen fatally shoot Ryan and four others as they tried to board the plane on Nov. 18 and fly back to the capital.\nPaul told the AP he believes the former commune should be developed as a heritage site.\n“I sat on the tourism board years ago and did suggest we do this, but the minister at the time lashed the idea down because the government wanted nothing to do with morbid tourism,” he recalled.\nUntil recently, successive governments shunned Jonestown, arguing that the country’s image was badly damaged by the mass murder-suicide, even though only a handful of Indigenous people died. The overwhelming majority of victims were Americans like Vilchez who flew to Guyana to follow Jones. Many endured beatings, forced labor, imprisonment and rehearsals for a mass suicide.\nThose in favor of a tour include Gerry Gouveia, a pilot who also flew when Jonestown was active.\n“The area should be reconstructed purely for tourists to get a first-hand understanding of its layout and what had happened,” he said. “We should reconstruct the home of Jim Jones, the main pavilion and other buildings that were there.”\nToday, all that is left is bits of a cassava mill, pieces of the main pavilion and a rusted tractor that once hauled a flatbed trailer to take temple members to the Port Kaituma airfield.\nUntil now, most visitors to Jonestown have been reporters and family members of those who died.\nOrganizing an expedition on one’s own is daunting: the area is far from the capital and hard to access, and some consider the closest populated settlement dangerous.\n“It’s still a very, very, very rough area,” said Fielding McGehee, co-director of The Jonestown Institute, a nonprofit group. “I don’t see how this is going to be an economically feasible kind of project because of the vast amounts of money it would take to turn it into a viable place to visit.”\nMcGehee warned about relying on supposed witnesses who will be part of the tour. He said the memories and stories that have trickled down through generations might not be accurate.\n“It’s almost like a game of telephone,” he said. “It does not help anyone understand what happened in Jonestown.”\nHe recalled how one survivor had proposed a personal project to develop the abandoned site, but those from the temple community said, ‘Why do you want to do that?’\nMcGehee noted that dark tourism is popular, and that going to Jonestown means tourists could say they visited a place where more than 900 people died on the same day.\n“It’s the prurient interest in tragedy,” he said.\nIf the tour eventually starts operating, not everything will be visible to tourists.\nWhen Vilchez returned to Guyana in 2018 for the first time since the mass suicide-murder, she made an offering to the land when she arrived in Jonestown.\nAmong the things she buried in the abandoned commune where her sisters and nephews died were snippets of hair from her mother and father, who did not go to Jonestown.\n“It just felt like a gesture that honored the people that died,” she said.\n",

    "content": "Irish actor Barry Keoghan has retaliated against what he describes as “inhumane” online trolling and accused people of intimidating his family.\nIn a lengthy statement published on X on Saturday after deactivating his Instagram account, the “Saltburn” star said he could “only sit and take so much.”\n“My name has been dragged across the internet in ways I usually don’t respond to. I have to respond now because it’s gettin to a place where there are too many lines being crossed. I can no longer let this stuff distract from my family and my work,” he wrote.\nKeoghan, who is known for his Oscar-nominated role in “The Banshees of Inisherin,” grew up in Dublin, Ireland, living in several different foster homes and with his grandmother as his mother was addicted to heroin.\nRelated article\nBarry Keoghan hits back at online trolls over ‘disgusting’ parenting comments\nShe died when he was 12, and his father died when he was 15. Critics have also taken aim at Keoghan’s role as a father to 2-year-old son Brando, whom he shares with an ex-partner.\n“The messages I have received no person should ever have to read them. Absolute lies, hatred, disgusting commentary about my appearance, character, how I am as a parent and every other inhumane thing you can imagine,” said Keoghan.\n“Talking about how I was a heroin baby and how I grew up and dragging my dear mother into it also,” he added.\nKeoghan said people had been “knocking on my grannies door” and “sitting outside my baby boy’s house intimidating them. That’s crossing a line.”\nWhile this latest flare-up came in the wake of the reported end of his relationship with American singer Sabrina Carpenter, this is not the first time Keoghan has raised the issue.\nHe spoke extensively about the damaging impact of online trolling in a wide-ranging interview on “The Louis Theroux Podcast” released in November.\nRelated article\nRingo Starr believes Barry Keoghan is ‘taking drum lessons’ to portray him in biopic\n“People kind of have a judgment on me as a parent,” Keoghan said at the time.\n“I’m like, well until you’ve walked a day in my shoes growing up as a kid, then you can comment… There’s a lot online. If I didn’t have tough skin or the strength I have, I wouldn’t be sitting here,” he added.\n“Of course it’s going to affect me being a father when I had no blueprint to take from.”\n“The more in the public I’ve become, the less I’ve posted about my child, because I don’t think it’s fair to put my child online, there’s sick people out there,” said Keoghan.\n“And because I’ve reined that in, people draw a narrative and go ‘absent father, sh*t deadbeat dad’ and more disgusting things that I wouldn’t even repeat. Just the audacity of some people, man, it sickens me and makes me furious.”\nHe spoke in a similar vein about the trolls who comment on his appearance, “especially on TikTok… people can sit there and make videos and be like ‘I don’t like his face, he looks weird, or he looks evil’ and just pick you apart.”\nCNN’s Issy Ronald contributed to this report.\n",

    "content": "The New York Times once wrote a story about how Mark Zuckerberg, the 40-year-old Meta CEO, had become disillusioned with the politics he’d once promoted. Zuck was “declining to engage with Washington except when necessary,” “stopped supporting programs at his philanthropy that could be perceived as partisan” and “tamped down employee activism at Meta.”\nIn short, the Times concluded, he was over it, even as he was trying to smooth over his long-strained relationship with Donald Trump.\nBut that was a long time ago — all the way back in September — and a quite a lot has changed.\nNow, as my colleague Clare Duffy reports, Zuck is angling for an “active role” in shaping tech policy in the incoming administration — potentially setting himself up to work directly with a president who recently threatened to jail him for life and a rival tech billionaire who once challenged him to a cage match.\nWhat happened in the two-ish months between the Times’ story and today is pretty simple: Trump won reelection, obviously.\nAnd in this bareknuckle world of corporate executive leadership, Zuckerberg and the like have little choice but to spin up some flattery and lay it on thick.\nFailing to do so risks upsetting a leader with a short fuse and the power to sink a company’s stock or ignite a boycott with a single social media post.\nTrump also welcomed his faithful “first buddy” Elon Musk into his inner circle, where Musk appears to be relishing his role as a kind of gatekeeper for executives hoping to snag an audience with the president-elect, per the Wall Street Journal. (Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI and the most prominent spokesman for the AI industry, is reportedly persona non grata around Mar-a-Lago because Musk “despises” him.)\nThe Musk factor adds a wrinkle to an already tricky diplomacy that Zuck, who has a history of beef with both men, would have had to engage in anyway.\nBut zooming out, it also reflects a broader shift in recent years in the way business leaders approach their job. If at one point it was cool to speak out on political issues — as many executives did during the first Trump administration and early in Joe Biden’s term — the pendulum has swung fully back.\nThe mood now: Bend the knee, or say nothing and pray no one notices.\nWe can see that happening not only in the parade of tech CEOs tweeting fawning congratulations to Trump but more broadly in the wave of companies backtracking on diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Last week, while many of us were either on vacation or busy typing “let’s circle back after the holiday” emails, Walmart said it would end its employee training programs designed to promote racial equity and evaluate funding for Pride events, among other things.\nTo be sure, plenty of companies are still committed to DEI programs, and not all executives are morphing into insufferable suck-ups.\nBut now that Trump has locked up a second term, businesses feel less pressure to fake it till they make it on the DEI front.\n“Trump’s election gives business leaders who were never committed to DEI an easy out,” Shaun Harper, a professor of education and business at the University of Southern California, recently told my colleague Nathaniel Meyersohn.\nIn other words, as the country embraces its strongman era, the idea of “stakeholder capitalism” — that companies should strive to be more than just profit machines — is losing its tug of war with the more traditional profit-at-all-costs model of “shareholder capitalism.”\nZuckerberg knows the stakes with Trump better than anyone.\nThis past spring, Trump called into CNBC to lash out at Facebook, calling the site an “enemy of the people” and sending Meta’s stock into a tailspin. And it’s more than just a single bad day on Wall Street that Zuck has to worry about.\nMeta (META) got to be a $1.5 trillion company thanks in part to a regulatory environment that allowed it to gobble up potential competitors, including Instagram and WhatsApp. That could be the key to Meta’s future growth as it contends with TikTok and YouTube’s stranglehold on Gen Z.\nPrivately, Zuck may well be fed up with politics. But he seems to recognize that as the head of one of the world’s largest publicly traded companies, he doesn’t have much choice.\n",

    "content": "President-elect Donald Trump appears keen on launching a simultaneous trade war with America’s three biggest trade partners: Mexico, China and Canada.\nThe price US consumers stand to pay for it could potentially be eased if companies move away from these countries. But where exactly will they go?\nThose three nations alone accounted for more than 40% of the total value of all goods the US imported last year, according to federal trade data.\nTrump recently pledged to impose an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports on top of existing ones. On the campaign trail, he also floated a 60% across-the-board tariff on Chinese goods. For Mexico and Canada, he said he plans to slap a new 25% tariff on all imports the very day he’s inaugurated.\nIn Trump’s ideal world, these higher tariffs would directly boost domestic manufacturing, since US businesses would be able to avoid tariffs entirely. To further incentivize companies to move production to the US, Trump has also dangled tax breaks.\nRelated article\nWhat to buy now before Trump’s tariffs kick in\nBut none of that is likely to cause a meaningful change in domestic production, said Daniel Anthony, managing director at Trade Partnership Worldwide, an economic research group. When Trump imposed steeper tariffs on Chinese goods in his first term, “very little production came back to the United States,” he said.\nThat was partly due to a lack of readily available infrastructure to make certain goods in the US. But even if that infrastructure had existed, moving manufacturing to the US mostly translates to much higher production costs that directly feed to higher prices consumers pay.\nSo, if tariffs on Chinese, Canadian and Mexican imports go up across the board, more businesses will likely look to shift their production to other nations to avoid what could be some of the steepest import taxes the US has seen in decades.\nThese are the countries most likely to be considered by companies looking to relocate their manufacturing.\nTrade experts CNN spoke to were in agreement that Vietnam would likely be a top contender, since it’s relatively cheap to manufacture goods there. Already, the country is the seventh top exporter of goods to the US and a beneficiary of the trade war with China.\nFrom 2017, when Trump was first in office, to 2023, Vietnam more than doubled the amount of goods it exports to the US, surging from $47 billion to $114 billion last year.\nHowever, if a lot of companies have the same idea of moving to Vietnam at around the same time, it could get ugly. “You do hit some bandwidth constraints pretty quickly,” said Anthony. Not only that, but it could become more expensive to produce there as suppliers respond to the influx in demand by raising prices, he added.\nWith Mexico the top source of US motor vehicle imports, European nations like Germany could tap into their own production capabilities, said Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\nSimilarly, Japan and South Korea, also heavyweights in car manufacturing, could ramp up production, he said.\nIn addition to Vietnam, Americans are likely to see more of their clothes and shoes coming from Indonesia, Bangladesh and Cambodia if there’s a new three-way trade war, said Anthony. Federal trade data shows that the US has increasingly been importing more apparel and shoes from these four nations in recent years.\nOn the luxury footwear and apparel side, though, Italy may experience higher production demand, Anthony added.\nTaiwan, the third-highest exporter of electronics to the US last year, could further amp up production as more companies seek to move away from China, which was the top electronics exporter to the US last year, Setser told CNN.\nOther Southeast Asian countries that have been exporting more electronic goods to the US in recent years — like Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea and Japan — are likely to increase their manufacturing, he said.\nSouth Korea and Japan also have currency advantages; both the won and the yen have weakened significantly over the past year relative to the US dollar, making it cheaper for Americans to buy goods from there.\nCompanies could also take a page from Apple’s book. The iPhone maker recently moved some of its production to India.\nThat option looks less likely, Setser said, because most Indian manufacturing is set up to meet the demand of the world’s most populous country: India. However, electronic manufacturing in other Southeast Asian countries is set up to meet global demand.\nMany businesses may have existing contracts to manufacture goods in a particular location for a set period of time.\nBut even if they don’t, “companies aren’t trying to avoid tariffs. They’re trying to get the lowest all-in cost for the best possible product,” Anthony told CNN. That means that some companies will be willing to absorb higher tariffs rather than moving elsewhere, if that ends up being the cheaper option.\nCase in point: Even after Trump began imposing higher tariffs on Chinese imports in 2018, many of which President Joe Biden left in place, the US didn’t stop importing goods from China entirely; it just stopped importing as much as it had been.\nFor instance, in 2017, before the tariffs went into effect, 60% of all computer equipment the US imported came from China, according to federal trade data. Last year, China accounted for just 39% of all computer equipment the US imported.\nIn total, the US imported $500 billion worth of Chinese goods in 2017, amounting to 22% of all US imports. Last year, however, the US imported $427 billion of goods from China, accounting for just 14% of total US imports.\nOver that timeframe, Mexican and Canadian imports each grew by more than $100 billion, with tariffs set at near zero because of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, combined with the simultaneous amplified tariffs levied on Chinese goods. That largely helps explain why Mexico overtook China as the top exporter to the US.\nStill, even with higher tariffs, Setser doesn’t think any auto producer is “going to want to abandon their expensive investments in Mexico,” especially because Mexico may escape higher tariffs as Trump appears more willing to negotiate a deal with them compared to China.\n“There’s bigger questions about moving out of China. And the hard thing about China is that there’s so much production capacity, and it’s so cheap.”\n",

    "content": "Sydney or Melbourne? It’s the great Australian city debate, one which pits the commerce, business and money of Sydney against cultural, arts-loving, coffee-drinking Melbourne.\nWhile picking one can be tricky, there’s no denying that Australia’s second city, home to 5.2 million people, has a charm all of its own.\nMelburnians (never Melbournites) get to enjoy a place where nature is close by, urban delights are readily available and the food and drink scene isn’t just the best in Australia, but also one of the finest in the world.\nThere’s no better way to start a trip to Melbourne than with a proper cup of coffee. Coffee is serious stuff here, with no room for a weak, burnt or flavorless brew. The history of coffee in Melbourne goes back to the years after World War II, when Italian immigrants arrived and brought their machines with them.\nWithin 30 years, a thriving cafe scene had developed and, as the 21st century dawned, the city had become the epicenter of a new global coffee culture. The iconic Pellegrini’s on Bourke Street and Mario’s in the Fitzroy neighborhood are the best old-school hangouts, while Market Lane helped lead the way in bringing Melbourne’s modern-day coffee scene to the masses.\nKate Reid is the best person to speak with about Melbourne’s coffee obsession. The founder of Lune Croissanterie, she was once a Formula 1 design engineer and has brought her expertise and precision to crafting the world’s best croissant, as well as knowing how to brew a coffee, and specifically a flat white, just the way it should be.\n“Good coffee is just ingrained in everyday culture for every single Melburnian now,” says Reid. “I think that that peak of pretentious specialty coffee has come and gone, and now it’s just come down to a level of a really high standard everywhere.”\nThat’s clear when she pours a flat white. Describing herself as a perfectionist, the way she froths the milk and tends to the cup is a sight to behold.\nRelated article\nMuğla: A magical but overlooked corner of the Mediterranean\nIt’s almost as impressive as her work with croissants. Having been blown away by one spectacular pastry in Paris, she returned to Melbourne determined to offer the very best breakfast treat for locals to enjoy with their morning flat white.\n“It’s a three-day process,” says Reid, speaking about how her team crafts what has been dubbed the best croissant in the world. “We create 27 layers of dough and butter within three millimeters of pastry.”\nA Lune croissant, she explains, is a hefty 43% butter. She even offers tips on when to eat it.\n“If you’re going to eat a croissant, it’s going to be 10 minutes out of the oven, which for me is the perfect moment,” she says.\nDemand is so high that Lune hand-makes 3,000 croissants a week. People come from across the world to try them and you can even pre-order to avoid disappointment, while special tasting sessions mean you try different flavors and drink as many flat whites as you can handle. If that’s not a perfect start to the day, then what is?\nIf Melbourne’s coffee scene is the ideal way to shake off any morning bleariness, encountering the terrifying “hook turn” on its streets is bound to leave you fully alert. This counterintuitive driving maneuver has been a cornerstone of the city’s roads since the 1930s. When needing to turn right, you veer all the way to the left of an intersection into a dedicated box, waiting for the lights on the opposite side to turn green and then turning a sharp right to execute the move across every lane of traffic.\nIf that seems alarming for drivers and pedestrians alike, more placid thrills await two hours south, on beautiful Phillip Island. An easy day trip from Melbourne, its stunning beaches and lush interior offer a chance to slow down and spend time with some of Australia’s most remarkable wildlife, especially koalas and penguins.\nIn fact, it’s the latter that have made this island so famous.\nRelated article\nWhy only 400 people at a time can visit this paradise island\nEvery evening, people come to Summerland Beach to watch a true natural spectacle, as thousands of Little Penguins return from hunting out at sea for a much-needed rest. Phillip Island is home to the largest colony of Little Penguins in the world, with around 40,000 making it their home.\n“They’re so clumsy and ridiculous,” laughs Vivien Zajicek, a research officer on the island as the flightless birds begin to make their journey back to land. “I think that’s why we like penguins … they’re clumsy, they’re relatable.”\nLooking closely, you can even work out their personality traits, explains Zajicek.\n“You see which are more brave and which are… more shy. Their body language is a bit lower.”\nHowever they carry themselves, this is a sight to warm the heart and make you realize why Australia is so special.\nAustralia’s icons are many. Kangaroos. Koalas. Uluru. The Sydney Opera House. The Melbourne Cricket Ground. And to that list you can also add Vegemite. This savory spread, made from yeast extract, was invented in Melbourne about 100 years ago as a rival to England’s similar (but never say identical) Marmite.\nA two-hour drive from Melbourne is Beaufort, Victoria. This is small-town Australia at its finest and was once the home of Cyril Callister, the man who invented Vegemite. It’s even home to a museum in his honor. Housed in a former gas station, it features a vast collection of memorabilia and also doubles up as a community arts space and co-working office for freelancers.\nRelated article\nAustralian slang terms every visitor should know\nMuch of the collection at the Cyril Callister Foundation comes from Vegemite superfan Gina Gardenal. She has amassed hundreds of pieces of memorabilia over the years, including magnets and photos, although, upsettingly for her, not the Vegemite travel clock.\nHer passion for the spread is something to behold. In fact, she won’t even say the word Marmite, only calling it “non-Vegemite.”\n“Alright… open up and bite,” she says as she prepares a blind taste test between the two bitter rivals, a feud every bit as meaningful as that between England and Australia when it comes to cricket. Of course, so close to its spiritual home, the Vegemite wins. To celebrate, Gardenal serves up a Vegemite cheesecake. Another thing to add to that Australian icons list.\nMelbourne’s myriad delights, from its street art-covered laneways to its world-beating coffee shops, are what make it a great place to both live and visit. But arguably its greatest export is a soap opera.\n“Neighbours,” Australia’s longest-running soap opera, came to an end in July 2022 after 37 years due to UK-based Channel 5 deciding against renewing a licensing deal for the show. Its finale garnered huge audiences and saw past stars, including Kylie Minogue, Guy Pearce and Margot Robbie, return for a surreal final episode. Robbie even sent 37 bottles of Champagne to the set to mark what was seen by many as the end of an era.\nHowever, in 2023, Amazon’s Freevee service engineered a remarkable comeback for the soap and it’s still being made.\nRelated article\nWhy only 400 people at a time can visit this paradise island\n“Neighbours” is set in the fictional Melbourne suburb of Erinsborough, although the street is real, as is the connection to the city. “Ramsey Street” is a place where visitors can come and explore and even meet stars past and present. The message is clear, the sets created to feel as if they are as much the viewers’ home as they are the characters’.\nLucinda Cowden knows about it better than most. She plays the soap’s long-running character, “Melanie.”\n“It’s like a thing that’s always been here,” she says of the show. “It’s one of those sort of … It’s iconic. It’s a touchstone.”\nCowden takes us around the set, showing us the program’s Lassiter’s Hotel and Harold’s, a spot named after one of the soap opera’s most renowned characters.\nCowden returned to the show in 2020 and is effusive about its connection to the city.\n“Melbourne’s got a feeling of heart,” she says, “And we have a real heartiness in Melbourne. And I think this show has that heart.”\nShe’s not wrong. This is an institution, both here in Australia and around the world.\nCNN’s Richard Quest contributed to this story.\n",

    "content": "A judge has paused an ongoing lawsuit against Linda McMahon, Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Education Department, that accuses her and the company she once led, World Wrestling Entertainment, of failing to act on allegations of sex abuse of children who helped ringside at wrestling events in the 1980s.\nThe move in the WWE case, from Judge James Bredar in Maryland’s federal district court, will keep the proceeding against McMahon and the company at bay until a ruling from the Maryland Supreme Court, which heard arguments in September.\nThe lawsuit raises questions of what McMahon knew and when at the time she was head of the professional wrestling company and a ringside announcer allegedly preyed on underage boys. The pause has the potential to delay the case through any Senate confirmation proceeding for McMahon, who denies the allegations.\nThe case recently arose after Maryland changed its law to lift the statute of limitations for lawsuits related to sex abuse of minors. But the Maryland Supreme Court is set to rule on a challenge to that law from other organizations that have been sued and argue they should not have to face allegations of turning a blind eye to abuse years after it occurs.\nThe suit alleges McMahon, her husband, the WWE and TKO Group Holdings, the league’s parent company, knowingly allowed employee Melvin Phillips Jr. to use his position as ringside announcer to sexually exploit children. Lawyers for both of the McMahons have called the accusations against them false.\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment and its parent company asked to pause the case against them, McMahon and her husband Vince earlier this month for reasons of “judicial efficiency and economy.” They also say they plan to challenge the Maryland law allowing for the lawsuit, if the case against them were to move forward, according to the court record.\nThe suit was filed in October in Baltimore County, Maryland, on behalf of five John Does, who say they were ages 13 to 15 when Phillips met and recruited them to work as “Ring Boys,” who helped set up and take down wrestling rings at WWE events.\nEach of them say they suffered mental and emotional abuse as a result of the alleged abuse.\nPhillips worked for the WWE in the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s as a “prominent ringside announcer and crew chief.” He died in 2012.\nThe lawsuit claims that the McMahons were negligent as employers and failed to protect the plaintiffs, and that they were aware of Phillips’ alleged abuse. Vince McMahon said that he and Linda were aware as early as the early to mid-﻿1980s that Phillips had a “peculiar and unnatural interest” in young boys, according to the filing, and at one point Phillips was fired from the company then rehired a few weeks later.\nCNN’s John Towfighi contributed to this report.\n",

    "content": "Ukraine hit a Russian weapons arsenal with US-made ATACMS missiles that it fired across the border for the first time, according to two US officials, in a major escalation on the 1,000th day of war.\nThe attack comes just two days after the Biden administration gave Kyiv the green light to use the longer-range American weapons against targets inside Russia.\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said Ukraine fired six ballistic missiles at a facility in Bryansk at 3:25 a.m. local time (7:25 p.m. ET) Tuesday and that ATACMS missiles had been used in the attack.\nRelated article\nPutin fine-tunes Russia’s nuclear doctrine after Biden’s arms decision on Ukraine, in clear signal to West\nThe attack marks the first time Ukraine has used the longer-range American weapons to strike targets deep inside Russia, and shows that Kyiv has wasted little time in making use of its newly-granted powers.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky declined to confirm or deny the attack during a Tuesday news conference but said: “Ukraine has long-range capabilities. Ukraine has long-range drones of its own production. We now have a long ‘Neptune’ (Ukrainian cruise missiles) and not just one. And now we have ATACMS. And we will use all of this.”\nRussian air defenses said they shot down five of the missiles and another was damaged. Fragments from the damaged missile fell on the territory of a military facility, causing a fire that has since been extinguished. There were no casualties or damage.\nOn the same day of the attack, Russian President Vladimir Putin updated Russia’s nuclear doctrine where Moscow will consider aggression from any non-nuclear state – but with the participation of a nuclear country – a joint attack on Russia.\nIn what appeared to be a fresh round of saber rattling, the Kremlin said Tuesday the revised military doctrine would, in theory, lower the bar to the use of nuclear weapons.\nUS President Joe Biden had authorized Ukraine to use longer-range American missiles inside Russia on Sunday, ending a months-long prohibition aiming to help Ukraine defend itself while not drastically escalating the conflict.\nThe decision came at a crucial moment in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia is probing on the frontlines in Ukraine’s east while pummeling its cities with missile and drone strikes, aiming to disable Ukraine’s power grid and weaponize the freezing temperatures for a third consecutive winter.\nMeanwhile, thousands of North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops launched a daring counteroffensive in the summer.\nIn a press briefing Monday, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the involvement of North Korean troops in the war was “a major escalation by Russia, bringing in an Asian military to a conflict inside Europe.”\nThe decision to allow the use of the Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, inside Russia had been under consideration for months, with American officials divided on the wisdom of allowing the new capability. Some had concerns about escalating the war, while others worried about dwindling stockpiles of the weapons.\nOther Western allies remain more cautious. At the G20 summit in Brazil on Tuesday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz reiterated his stance of withholding Taurus missiles from Ukraine, adding that “supplying cruise missiles would be a mistake.”\nAlthough Kyiv has repeatedly used Ukrainian-made drones to hit targets in Russia – deeper into the country than Bryansk – Moscow has long maintained that using far-reaching Western weapons would constitute a major escalation.\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Tuesday that Moscow will view launches of US-made longer-range missiles as a “new phase of war” by the West.\nAmerican officials said they were unsurprised by the news of Putin updating Russia’s nuclear doctrine. “Russia had been signaling its intent to update its doctrine for several weeks,” a US official told CNN.\nPentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said at a briefing that the US doesn’t have any indications that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon within Ukraine, adding, “It’s the same irresponsible rhetoric that we’ve seen before and that we’ve seen, frankly, for the past two years.”\nIn more than two-and-a-half years of war, Russia has often rattled the nuclear saber in response to perceived escalation by Ukraine and its allies.\n﻿After French President Emmanuel Macron said earlier this year that he would not rule out sending European troops to Ukraine, Putin ordered a tactical nuclear weapons drill in response to what he called “threats” by the West.\nFor months, Ukraine’s President Zelensky had argued that “long-range capabilities for our army” is a key part of his “Victory Plan” for winning the war.\nResponding on Sunday evening to reports of Biden’s green-light, Zelensky said: “Strikes are not carried out with words. Such things are not announced. Missiles will speak for themselves.”\nCNN’s Natasha Bertrand, Daria Tarasova-Markina, Kevin Liptak, Michael Conte and Chris Stern contributed to this report.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n",

    "content": "In 2021, Google announced $1 billion of investment in Africa, aiming to enhance connectivity, drive innovation and support local entrepreneurs. Three years on, it claims this investment is working. According to a recent report commissioned by the tech giant, in 2023 its services – including Search, Maps, and YouTube – generated $16 billion in economic activity across the region.\nNigeria-born Alex Okosi, Google’s managing director for Sub Saharan Africa, spoke to CNN about his vision for the company, from transformative infrastructure projects like the Equiano subsea internet cable connecting Africa to Europe and the recently announced Umoja cable route linking Kenya to Australia, to the expansion of Google Translate to incorporate more African languages, and the role of AI.\nThe following interview has been edited for clarity and length.\nCNN: How important is the African market for Google? Why did you invest $1 billion into it?\nAlex Okosi: The African market has incredible potential. Think about it, over the next four or five years, more than 40% of the global youth population will be on this continent. That means that the workforce of today or tomorrow is going come from Africa. We see Africa not just as an opportunity from a business standpoint, but as an opportunity for the globe to really benefit from the immense potential and talent that Africa has to offer.\nNow, clearly, there’s a lot of challenges that we need to overcome. The digital divide on this continent is still there. Hence the reason why we really wanted to make sure that we invested in Africa in the right way – across every single value chain that matters to be able to help Africa achieve its full potential.\nCNN: Why is it important to invest in infrastructure and how important are these projects for the businesses and the people in Africa?\nAO: One of the biggest challenges that we have on this continent is that there’s still a huge digital divide. The cost of data is still high, connectivity is still a challenge. Investing in infrastructure like Equiano and Umoja are going to help bring down these costs and enable businesses to hopefully tap into this digital highway that enables them to be more efficient.\nNow (the drop in data costs) is not going to be immediate. We still need to partner with last-mile operators to make sure that they are leveraging this new bandwidth, and it’s bringing the cost down so the consumer can feel it. We don’t want to leave anyone behind, and the only way to ensure that is to make sure the cost of data is lower.\nCNN: How might that expansion of Google Translate to include more African languages help to facilitate business communication and increase social inclusion on the continent?\nAO: The power of AI has enabled us to bring more languages online at a much faster rate. I’m excited about the 13 new languages that we introduced to Google Translate, including my native Igbo language. It really opens the opportunity for more than 300 million people that speak these languages to be able to access the internet in a language that’s organic to them.\nFrom an inclusion standpoint, it means that we have a much bigger community of people that are now going to be able to participate in using digital tools to be able to grow their businesses and their careers. If I’m someone from a rural area and I speak a particular language, I’m now able to participate in this digital revolution that we talk about on a day-to-day basis, as part of the continent’s growth.\nRelated article\nElectric motorcycle completes solar-powered 6,000-kilometer journey through Africa\nCNN: In 2018, Google launched its first African AI research center in Ghana. What opportunities do you think these AI research centers are going to do for the continent?\nAO: Our AI research centers are going to benefit the continent in a lot of ways, and we’re already seeing some of those benefits. For instance, one of the main things that really affect farmers on this continent is pest outbreaks. We’ve now developed an AI solution that enables us to predict possible devastating outbreaks on crops seven days in advance.

As Google, we talk about being bold, being responsible. It’s about working with the communities, with academia, with governments to make sure that we have frameworks for developing AI that best serves the citizens and the communities that we serve. The important thing is that we are rolling out AI responsibly and that we are mitigating the risk associated with AI.\nRelated article\nIntra-Africa trade could double in next five years, says Secretary General of African Continental Free Trade Area\nCNN: In 10 years’ time, where do you see Africa?\nAO: In 10 years’ time, I think we are going to have a lot more people that are digitally skilled, they’re going to be able to leverage the power of technology and AI to really transform this continent, creating more job opportunities, more innovation, more companies, more growth. I think that AI will help us solve a lot of the societal challenges, whether it’s on food security, healthcare, or making the agriculture sector much more productive.\nMy dream is that as we move into the future, we’re going to have more and more African startups like (Nigerian fintech company) Moniepoint that become unicorns (privately owned companies valued at more than $1 billion) on this continent, because I truly believe that’s where we’re headed. Africa has an incredible potential and I’m just excited to be one of the people seeing it firsthand.\n",

    "content": "Italian authorities have recovered precious 3rd century B.C. artifacts from an Etruscan necropolis looted by a couple of bungling tomb raiders in Umbria who stumbled across the haul on their land.\nThe Etruscans flourished in central Italy around 2,500 years ago but were gradually assimilated into the Roman empire. They left behind lavish tombs, pottery and statues but tantalizingly few written documents and patchy evidence of their daily lives.\nThe artifacts, including eight urns, two sarcophagi and beauty accessories such as bronze mirrors and a perfume bottle still redolent of its original scent, are worth at least 8 million euros ($8.5 million), Carabinieri art police said.\nThey were found in Citta della Pieve, about 150 kilometers (90 miles) north of Rome.\nOne sarcophagus contained the full skeleton of a woman in her 40s, while the urns were finely decorated with scenes from Greek mythology and female figures with still-visible red paint on their lips and gold coloring on their jewels.\nPolice seized the loot from two entrepreneurs who had unearthed Etruscan burial chambers while excavating land they owned, Perugia Chief Prosecutor Raffaele Cantone told a press conference on Tuesday.\nThey “had nothing to do with the world of (practiced) tomb raiders” and were “clumsy” and “amateurish” in the way they tried to access the black market for looted art, the prosecutor said.\nThe Carabinieri caught up with them after they posted pictures of their discovery on the internet in the hope of finding buyers, triggering investigations that included phone wiretaps, stakeouts and air surveillance drones.\nRelated article\nUS returns looted antiquities worth $10 million to India\nPolice finally swooped on the suspects after one of them posted on Facebook a picture of himself with a looted artifact, Cantone said.\nThe pair face charges related to theft and trading in stolen goods, and risk jail sentences of up to 10 years, said prosecutor Annamaria Greco, who led the investigation.\nAnother Etruscan tomb, belonging to the same “Pulfna” family, was found in Città della Pieve in 2015. At the time, the farmer who made the discovery reported it to authorities and got about 100,000 euros ($105,000) as a reward.\nCittà della Pieve is close to San Casciano dei Bagni, a Tuscan village where a major archaeological discovery was announced in 2022, with ancient bronze statues found among the mud of thermal baths once used by Etruscans and Romans.\n",

    "content": "A mom from Australia captured the heartwarming moment her toddler and a surprising animal at the zoo became best friends, and internet users can't cope.\nIn a viral TikTok video shared earlier in November by @hikayvee, the little boy, Sonny, can be seen swinging side to side as he dances at the zoo, when a stingray looking at him through the aquarium glass, starts making the same moves.\n\"Did we just become best friends?\" says layover text in the clip. A caption says: \"Sonny & this stingray having a boogy together.\"\nThe poster, 30-year-old Kayla Staff-Valastro from Melbourne, told Newsweek that when she noticed her son dancing with the stingray she thought it was the cutest thing, and she has watched her hilarious clip over a hundred times so far.\nWhen you think of a friendly animal you probably picture anything but fish. But did you know that some marine species can actually forge very meaningful connections with humans?\nAn article written by Dr. Rabiah Ryklief, principal scientist and lecturer of marine science, with a Ph.D in zoology, for Ocean Info, said that while there are indeed some vicious creatures roaming the oceans, many others have a very gentle predisposition.\nSome of the most friendly ocean creatures include bottle-nose dolphins, known for their playful and curious nature; sea lions, often approaching divers for playful interactions; humpback whales; giant Pacific octopus; whale sharks; Atlantic spotted dolphins; leafy sea dragons, and manta rays.\nManta rays are not to be confused with stingrays, like the one featured in the clip. Since the tragic death of Australian zookeeper, conservationist, and television personality, Steve Irwin in 2006, following a stingray attack, these animals have been very controversial, and many people are still scared to be around them.\nBut are these sea creatures as dangerous as they are portrayed to be? National Geographic explained that stingrays have a barb with serrated edges and a sharp point, with the underside producing venom, which can be fatal to humans.\nHowever, according to the Professional Association of Diving Instructors, the world's largest ocean exploration and diver organization, despite their venom and their sharp barbs, stingrays kills less people worldwide every year than cows, bees, or even vending machines falling on humans.\nThe website explained that stingrays only attack when they feel threatened, and will usually stay in their lane if not disturbed. As they are mostly found in shallow waters, buried under the sand, stepping on them is a risk.\nThat's why it is good practice to do the \"stingray shuffle\" sliding your feet along the shallow, sandy bottom, to alert any stingrays to your presence, and give them time to swim away before getting into the water.\nThe video quickly went viral on social media and it has so far received over 2.3 million views and 476,300 likes on the platform.\nOne user, Jake from State Farm, commented: \"When you're on the same wavelength.\"\nAndi said: \"THIS IS WHY SEA PANCAKES ARE MY FAVORITE!!! look at them groovin together.\"\nAnother user, Abby Butcher, wrote: \"I like how he's smiling at the little boy.\"\nGooglepixel added: \"Oh this is a core memory for sure.\"\nDo you have funny and adorable videos or pictures of your pet you want to share? Send them to life@newsweek.com with some details about your best friend and they could appear in our Pet of the Week lineup.\nCorrection 11/19/24, 12:43 p.m. ET: An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to stingrays as sea mammals.\n",

    "content": "With tears in his eyes, Rafael Nadal said goodbye to professional tennis on Tuesday.\nIn a message to his adoring fans, one of the all-time greatest athletes said he just wanted to be celebrated for something so simple.\n“I just want to be remembered as a good person and a kid that followed their dreams and achieved more than what I’ve ever dreamed,” the Spanish great modestly said after playing in his final match.\nDespite Nadal and Spain having just been shockingly ousted from the Davis Cup by the Netherlands, the 38-year-old appeared at peace with his decision to walk away from a trophy-laden career while listening to his peers praise him in a tribute video.\n“It was such a privilege to play with you but especially against you,” Roger Federer said. “Congratulations on the most incredible career.”\nNovak Djokovic added, “Your tenacity, your fighting spirit, the energy that you brought, the power, is something that will be studied and something that will be transferred to many, many generations that are coming up.\n“I’ve been very honored and thrilled to be called your rival.”\nSerena Williams admitted, “You inspired me to have so many wins - to keep going - to fight - to get better - to improve - to basically play like you.”\nThe accolades could have continued for hours.\nAs he walked off the court, the tennis great blew kisses to the crowd and hugged his Spanish teammates before waving goodbye.\nNadal’s singular career began in 2001, when he turned professional at the age of just 14.\nIt wasn’t until April 2002, when Nadal was two months shy of his 16th birthday, that he recorded the first ATP Tour win of his career, which fittingly came on his home island of Mallorca.\nNadal then propelled himself from world No. 199 to No. 49 in 2003, winning Challenger titles and matches at Masters 1000 events, as well as recording his first two wins over top 10 opponents – including his current coach, Carlos Moyá.\nThe following year would be Nadal’s breakthrough on tour and cement his place as a Spanish hero.\nRelated article\nThis world-class athlete talks like Aristotle and acts like Confucius. We can all learn from him\nHe won the first ATP singles title of his career at the Pokrom Open and then, at just 18 years of age, beat world No. 2 Andy Roddick in the final of the Davis Cup on home soil to help Spain win the title for only the second time in history.\nIt is fitting that Nadal bade farewell to tennis on the stage that helped make him in Spain.\nThat year, 2003, there was also the small matter of a first meeting with Federer, a straight sets win for Nadal at the Miami Open that surely nobody predicted would be the beginning of arguably tennis’ greatest rivalry.\n“All that buzz I’d been hearing about you — about this amazing young player from Mallorca, a generational talent, probably going to win a major someday — it wasn’t just hype,” Federer wrote of that match in his farewell message to Nadal.\nBut 2004 was the year Nadal truly shot to stardom and became a household name.\nHe won 24 straight matches during the clay court season, breaking Andre Agassi’s Open Era record for most consecutive victories by a teenager, culminating in his first French Open title in his tournament debut.\nHe may not quite have been the King of Clay just yet, but his game on the red stuff was already looking princely.\nNadal became the first male teenager to win a grand slam since Pete Sampras won the 1990 US Open and climbed to a career high No. 3 in the world.\nIt was the first of four straight French Open titles, before he was stunned by Robin Söderling in the fourth round in 2009 for his first ever defeat at Roland Garros.\nThat loss would be the first of just three that Nadal suffered at the French Open, though he had to retire injured ahead of his third-round match in 2016, giving him a 112-3 record on the Parisian clay, a win rate of 97.39%.\n“On clay, it felt like I was stepping into your backyard, and you made me work harder than I ever thought I could just to hold my ground,” Federer wrote.\n“You made me reimagine my game – even going so far as to change the size of my racquet head, hoping for any edge.”\nNadal’s relentless brilliance on clay redefined what it means to dominate a surface.\nThe Spaniard finished his career with 14 French Open titles, two Australian Opens, two Wimbledon titles and four US Opens for a total of 22 grand slams, second all-time behind only Djokovic.\n“I’ve been able to compete against him a couple of times, get wins over him which, again, you tell the little kid that’s watching him on TV winning 14 Roland Garros in a row, it’s pretty special,” world No. 9 Alex de Minaur told CNN Sport.\n“All those experiences of sharing the court with him is something I’ll take with me for a very long time and I’ll pass it on to generations to come.”\nThough grass was considered Nadal’s weakest of the three grand slam surfaces, it was on  Wimbledon’s Centre Court that he enjoyed arguably his most iconic moment.\nIn the fading late-evening summer light, Nadal finally toppled Federer in 2008 and ended the Swiss’ five-year winning run at Wimbledon in a match that spanned almost seven hours from start to finish due to rain delays.\nThat was the last year Wimbledon was played without a roof on Centre Court, putting an end to matches being interrupted by dramatic hours-long delays.\nFederer beat Nadal in the final in 2006 and 2007, but the Spaniard had demolished Federer 6-1, 6-3, 6-0 in the French Open final a month earlier.\nIn practical darkness on Centre Court, Nadal eventually won 9-7 in the fifth set. It is considered by many to be the greatest tennis match of all time.\n“I didn’t watch a lot of tennis growing up but even I was watching Rafa,” ATP Finals runner-up Taylor Fritz told CNN Sport recently.\n“I remember the Wimbledon final with him and Fed and it’s insane that I was a little kid – not like a teenager – I was a little kid watching him play and then we grew up and have gotten the chance to play against him.\n“That’s something that’s so special and there’s only a couple of players that are like that. It’s really kind of crazy when you get the chance to play against him.”\nIn August 2008, Nadal finally became world No. 1 for the first time, a position he would hold for a total of 209 weeks throughout his career.\nAmong his many career achievements, Nadal became just the second man to achieve the career singles ‘Golden Slam’ in 2010 – winning all four grand slams and Olympic gold – and helped Spain win four Davis Cup titles.\nHe also won Olympic doubles gold in 2016 and amassed a total of 92 ATP titles.\nNadal developed a reputation as one of the most tenacious players tennis has seen, chasing down every ball with fierce determination, even those that many other players would have given up as lost causes.\nBut the question is frequently asked as to whether Nadal’s aggressive style of play that made him so successful has in some way contributed to his injury problems.\nWith the number of injuries Nadal has suffered over the course of his career, it’s easy to ask: ‘What if?’\nWhat if he hadn’t missed 11 grand slams due to various ailments? What if his body hadn’t failed him numerous times throughout his career?\nHow many grand slams would Nadal have now? How many more records would he have broken?\nBut Nadal never let the injuries define his career; though, of course, they played a big part. Instead, his career has largely been defined by his response to them: his tenacity, his will to win, and his unrelenting desire to come back time and again - and return to the top.\nIn the end, however, it proved to be one injury too many for his 38-year-old body to recover from – though his mind was evidently still as willing as ever, with Nadal often expressing his desire to return again next year.\nBut the injuries just mean the numbers and records Nadal has accumulated over his career are all the more remarkable.\n",

    "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Stress, But Less newsletter. Our six-part mindfulness guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it.\nPicture this — thousands of screenshots, unopened texts and emails, and a looming notification that your phone’s storage is almost full. For many, such is the new reality in the digital age.\nBut if your device is filled with too much digital clutter, it could be affecting your mental health and productivity, experts say.\n“It’s something that triggers a lot of stress and anxiety, the collection of emails, pictures, open tabs — an overwhelming number of digital items that trigger overload,” said Dr. Susan Albers, a clinical psychologist at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.\n“What’s interesting about it is that this isn’t the type of problem that our ancestors have had to face, but when we fast-forward to today, our daily life is really plagued with a lot of digital clutter,” she added.\nEveryone with a digital device will likely face such clutter at some point. But sometimes, the common behavior can tip over into a disorder that more researchers are trying to understand: digital hoarding.\nWorried you might have saved too much on your devices? Here’s how to ease up on digital clutter and know when you might be displaying signs of a disorder, according to experts.\nIf you find yourself having to wade through thousands of photos or files to find what you need or are experiencing less concentration and mental energy than usual, it may be a sign that you have too much digital clutter, Albers said.\n“Digital clutter is just as stressful as actual clutter in our physical world,” she said. “Our brains are really predisposed to favor clarity and simplicity over chaos, and that’s how it can feel when you have a million tabs open.”\nDigital clutter can also be seen as a constant stream of notifications, which can take away your focus and slow down your concentration, she added.\nMaybe you want to hold on to memories through pictures or hang on to unneeded documents and files from college courses or old jobs just in case. But sometimes, when the behavior turns into large amounts of information being stored, it can be considered hoarding, said Dr. Emanuel Maidenberg, a clinical professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at UCLA’s David Geffen School of Medicine.\nRelated article\nWhy you’re more likely to solve your problems on a therapist’s sofa than on social media\n“It becomes a habit that is motivated by anxiety, and that’s when it becomes challenging and difficult. It has to do with the fear of needing this information at some point in the future and yet not having access to it and not knowing where to find it,” said Maidenberg, who is also the director of the UCLA Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Clinic.\nA digital hoarding disorder will be fueled by a persistent urge to save digital information, rather than a “preference” to store that is more flexible, he added.\nIt is estimated that about 3% to 5% of the global population — about 8 million to 12 million people in the United States — suffer from hoarding disorder, said Dr. Sanjaya Saxena, psychiatrist and director of clinical and research affairs at the Boston-based International OCD Foundation.\nHoarding is considered to be related to obsessive-compulsive disorder, and a 2019 study that surveyed hundreds of adults in the UK found the behavior to be common in the workplace. A 2020 follow-up study found four distinct types of digital hoarding: those who are organized, those who are disorganized, those who keep the digital information on behalf of their companies, and those who keep it out of strong emotional ties and often worry about losing it.\nRelated article\nMy social media is helpful and positive. Here is how yours can be, too\nStoring digital clutter that crosses over into a disorder depends on the individual, but a key factor is when it causes significant distress or impairment in everyday functioning, Saxena added.\nHow can you tell if you may be experiencing digital hoarding? If the clutter is taking up so much space on your devices so you can’t store other stuff that you need, or if wading through the clutter is “taking away time from other necessary activities or social activities, or interfering with (your) life in any other way,” it may be a sign of excess acquisition of digital material, Saxena said.\n“Decluttering is like a magic wand to your mental health,” Albers said. For those who struggle with decluttering, she recommends dedicating a few minutes each morning to do a digital audit, deleting emails and other notifications that aren’t needed. If you spend a couple of minutes decluttering before you start working, “it’s going to pave the way for the rest of your day to be much more productive.”\nHere are some other tips for decreasing digital clutter and how it affects your day, according to Albers:\n1. Turn off nonessential notifications and unsubscribe from any advertisements clogging up your emails. “It’s almost like mental mosquitoes. They’re always buzzing,” Albers said. By limiting the number of notifications, you limit their ability to take away your focus at times when you need it.\n2. Set boundaries: Minimize the amount of time you spend checking your emails and social media notifications and use your device’s silencing and do not disturb features for other times. Also, limiting the number of accounts you follow on social media can decrease the clutter on your feed and the amount of time spent mindlessly scrolling, she added.\n3. Take a digital detox day, or at least some time out of the day in which you’re not tuned in to your digital world, which can help you feel less overwhelmed by the clutter and constant notifications, she said. Having a plan for how to tackle digital clutter and making a commitment to declutter a little each day, or not store more than what is needed, can help those who may be suffering from digital hoarding, Maidenberg said.\nRelated article\nOne change I made to my social media use made a big difference on my mood\nIf you find yourself being affected in school or at work —  such as turning in assignments late — having trouble sleeping at night due to being overwhelmed or feeling disconnected from relationships, these can be signs of significant distress, and it may be time to see a mental health professional, Albers said.\n“We all deal with digital clutter more than we think that we do,” she added, “and I think that (decluttering) is one simple way, if we put a little bit of time into it, that has great payoffs in terms of our productivity and just overall happiness.”\n",

    "content": "My journey as a funeral director started early. My Catholic grade school shared a street with a cemetery in my small rural Indiana hometown. At recess, I'd often see funeral processions drive by, only at the time I thought it was a parade. It wasn't until my teachers explained it to me that I realized it was, in fact, a funeral procession. At that moment I knew I wanted to lead that parade.\nI also remember attending a funeral for a family member who passed away when I was nine. I was so shocked and disappointed, along with the rest of my family, at how he looked in the casket. I never wanted something like this to happen to another family.\nThat same year, I was in my school library and found a book about embalming in ancient Egypt. A single sentence stood out: Modern day embalmers are sometimes called morticians or funeral directors. When I read this, I knew that was what I was going to be. At 15 years old I started working for a local funeral home, and 2024 is my 15th year in the profession.\nIn those 15 years, I have made many meaningful connections with families in my community that make my career rewarding—one of the most impactful connections happened recently. I turned 30 earlier this year, and that same week I served the family of a young woman who was also 30 when she died.\nThe way her family commemorated her, from the music they played to the way they spoke about her, moved me. I felt like my life was just beginning at this milestone, but here was this wonderful person who I never got to meet. I wondered if we would have been friends if we met—we have the same taste in music and fashion. It was a humbling moment that reminded me why I chose this career and continue to find meaning in what I do more than a decade later.\nFrom fashion to workplace culture and every TikTok trend in between, there is no shortage of social commentary on how Gen Z is redefining norms and challenging older generations to think differently.\nDeath and grief are no different. A recent first-of-its-kind survey from the National Funeral Directors Association (NFDA) sought to uncover generational differences relating to end-of-life matters, especially as Gen Z comes of age and enters early adulthood. The survey found that while cremation is still a top preference for Baby Boomers, Gen X, and Millennials, Gen Z stands alone with traditional burial as their top preference, bucking decades of preferences trending toward cremation.\nAs a millennial who is fifteen years into my career as a funeral director, I am inspired by this next generation, not only by their willingness to approach death differently, but also as they redefine work and success. I think both these generational characteristics make many Gen Zs ideal candidates for a job path they may have never even considered: funeral director.\nI know not everyone is lucky enough to know what they want to do with their life at nine years old, and to continue to foster that passion when they are 30. Like many fellow Millennials, as well as Gen Z, success to me is about living a life and choosing a profession that gives me purpose and value. In fact, 86 percent of Gen Z say having a sense of purpose is important in their overall job satisfaction and well-being. But that's easier said than done, especially as today's young adults graduate into a tough job market.\nMore than half of Gen Z view funeral directors as important, valuable, and trustworthy and are the most likely to hold this belief compared to older generations, according to a recent NFDA survey. Sixty-eight percent of Gen Z believe it is important to commemorate the life of a loved one with a funeral or memorial service compared to 44 percent of Baby Boomers. With nearly 8,000 projected job openings in the next decade, the funeral industry is in urgent need of talent to fill these vital roles.\nWhile funeral service is undoubtedly an accessible career path with job openings, it's more than that. It's clear that Gen Z, along with their Millennial counterparts, value leaders who serve their communities and take social responsibility seriously, as well as memorializing their loved ones when they have died in a meaningful way. So, why wouldn't this generation want to become those valued, trusted community leaders themselves to help families do the same?\nIt's not just on Gen Z to come to this realization themselves. It's up to us as seasoned professionals to encourage and mentor the next generation. Mentors make the mortician, and mine have been instrumental in getting me where I am today.\nThey taught me resilience, and how to accept that you need to make mistakes in order to grow. They taught me persistence, an invaluable tool as a young, first-generation female funeral director who is often overlooked and not taken seriously. They helped me grow into a strong, confident leader who could become one of 20 funeral service professionals in the 2022-23 NFDA National Emerging Leaders Program.\nAlthough many Americans believe talking about death and dying is healthy and normal, according to new NFDA research, most people do not make funeral arrangements often enough to know exactly what needs to happen when a loved one dies.\nWhile they may be open to talking about death and dying, it can be different in practice. It is critical that we continue to have members of our community who are experts on all options, including the latest trends and innovations in funeral service, to help people navigate one of the most difficult times in their lives.\nFor Millennials like me and all older generations in funeral service and beyond, I call on you to embrace the role of mentor and welcome the next generation into your professional community with open arms.\nWe need to say yes to innovation and new ideas, not gatekeep knowledge or judge Gen Z based on generational differences. We need to create a stronger line of communication across Baby Boomers, Gen X, Millennials, and Gen Z to share decades of knowledge and help create more compassionate, purpose-driven and supported funeral service professionals—and people.\nAs I look ahead to the next 15 years of my career and beyond, I ask myself one question and encourage others to do the same, no matter what career they are in: Are you doing the work to inspire a new generation of leaders and being the person you needed when you first started out?\nFor me, the answer is always yes, and I for one am excited to see what the future holds.\nAllyse Worland, CFSP, is a Licensed Funeral Director and Embalmer in the states of Indiana and Kentucky, as well as a spokesperson for the National Funeral Directors Association (NFDA).

    "content": "John Towsen and his wife, Riley Kellogg, watched in horror last Sunday as the flames in nearby trees inched closer and closer to their home of nearly five years. Suddenly, they realized they had no choice but to evacuate.\n“We didn’t know if we were coming back to the home or not,” Towsen told CNN three days later, as he stood in front of his home in Greenwood Lake, about 35 miles northwest of New York City.\nBehind him, firefighters were still dousing the flames that had threatened the neighborhood, leaving behind rows of burnt trees. “It’s kind of miraculous that we do still have a home and we’re very thankful for that,” Kellogg added.\nAcross the street, she pointed to a home she says was destroyed by a microburst – a punch of sinking air in a severe thunderstorm that could cause damage similar to a tornado – during a severe thunderstorm in May, just one month after a 4.8 magnitude earthquake shook their community.\n“The disasters that we’ve been experiencing, I hope that they really bring home to people what’s going on, on a global scale,” Kellogg said. “And how, when we see the effects of it on our own lives here, that we really can connect them to what’s happening all over the world and how our actions and our connections and what we do in our governments, how all of this has an effect on our lives directly.”\nIt’s been a year of unusual extremes for New Yorkers.\nIn April, a 4.8 magnitude earthquake rattled buildings across parts of the Northeast. Throughout the summer, multiple towns experienced tornadoes, according to the National Weather Service. In July, an EF2 tornado passed through Rome during a severe storm that killed one person and caused widespread damage. An EF1 tornado in Buffalo also damaged buildings and trees and overturned cars in August.\nThere are currently 13 wildfires across the state encompassing more than 5,000 acres, according to Governor Kathy Hochul’s office. Among the fires is the Jennings Creek/Sterling State Park fire, which tore through areas along the New Jersey-New York border. An 18-year-old New York State Forest Ranger volunteer and state employee died on November 9 when a tree fell while he was responding to the wildfire in Greenwood Lake.\nRelated article\nVolunteer forest ranger, 18, dies responding to New York wildfire that sent smoky haze over NYC\nHuman-induced climate change fuels more extreme wildfire conditions globally and in the US, providing a stark reminder of how the climate crisis is upending lives and inflicting billions of dollars a year in damage. It will only get worse, according to fire experts.\nNew York City alone has experienced over 230 brush fires since October 29, according to the New York City Fire Department. A brush fire in Brooklyn’s Prospect Park burned two acres of dry vegetation, spurring firefighters to battle the blaze for more than three hours, the fire department said.\nOnly 0.01 inch of precipitation was recorded in October in New York City, making it the driest month in the city since record keeping began in 1869, a spokesperson for the New York City Emergency Management Department told CNN.\n“Central Park normally sees over 8.5 inches of rain in September and October but has only seen about 1.5 inches since the beginning of September,” the spokesperson said. “That’s a huge difference.”\nWith this lack of rainfall, drought numbers have been increasing substantially across the Northeast. As of November 5, about 55% of the region was under some sort of drought, providing plenty of fuel for wildfires. The National Weather Service issued red flag warnings for over 50 million people over the past week, including Washington DC, Philadelphia, New York and Boston.\nRecord-breaking heat waves, severe floods and wildfires, exacerbated by rapid climate change, are the new normal –- and people should start getting used to unusual and extreme weather, according to climate scientists and experts.\n“Everything’s just getting a little wackier. There’s a scientist who called it Global Weirding. Everything’s getting weird,” Stephanie Spera, an assistant professor of geography, environment and sustainability at the University of Richmond, told CNN “Almost every single person can say they have experienced an extreme weather event, whether it be hurricane or tornado or wildfire or blizzard. It’s getting harder and harder.”\nEarthquakes, most of which are the result of a slippage of geologic plates sliding past each other, are not correlated to climate change, says Brenda Ekwurzel, the director of scientific excellence at the Union of Concerned Scientists.\nRecently, scientists have also noticed an increase in tornado reports happening in the Northeast. A record 32 tornadoes in New York have been reported to date in 2024 – compared to 10 in 2023 and 7 in 2022, according to the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nScientists are still investigating how the climate crisis may intensify tornado activity. Nonetheless, as climate change has created a warmer, more humid and unstable world, the conditions that produce strong thunderstorms that can form tornadoes are more likely, according to the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions.\n“Without hesitancy, I can say warmer climates create more favorable environments for storms, create more energy for storms, and stronger storms can lead to higher incidence of tornadoes,” Spera said.\nWhile scientists are less confident about climate change’s general effect on severe thunderstorms, they’re more confident it’s driving the unusually warm temperatures that are behind droughts across New York and other parts of the country.\nWildfires are fueled by a knot of factors, both natural and human-caused, but scientists say global warming is fueling more frequent, more intense and severe blazes. Hotter temperatures are the clearest climate change-fueled contributor to wildfires. In part, that’s because heat sucks the moisture from vegetation, making it much more combustible.\nDown the road from Towsen and Kellogg, Esler and Maureen VanHouten also watched the fire inch closer to their home. Despite their fear, however, they didn’t leave their community.\n“Why would you stay? There’s earthquakes and tornadoes, but it’s your home,” Maureen said. “Something just keeps you here.”\nThe couple kept looking over their shoulders at the trucks of first responders racing up and down their road. Since the fire ignited last week, they haven’t been able to sleep through the night.\n“It’s your home and you’re just so, so scared of what’s going to happen, there’s so much sentimental value,” Maureen said. “Our kids grew up here. I know people say, ‘Oh, it’s just a building,’ but there’s so many memories.”\nTom Howley, the mayor of the Greenwood Lake, said their community is not used to contending with fires of this magnitude.\n“We get snow, we get rain, we get fires, but we don’t really get extremes. This is the most extreme I’ve seen,” Howley said.\nNow that the region is experiencing an increase in wildfires, people should always monitor warnings for their region, says Ekwurzel, of the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n“These particular wildfires are often triggered by human causes, just carelessness or something sparking something,” she said. “I’ve been getting red flag warnings on my weather app, so I know I’m not supposed to burn a fire, but if people aren’t getting that information, they may be inadvertently starting a little fire and not realizing just how dry the conditions are.”\nAs humans continue to heat up the world with fossil fuel pollution, scientists warn these kinds of fires will only become more common.\n“I have two young kids and I am terrified for what this means for the future with the new administration, rolling back really progressive policies,” Spera said. “I wish people would care and get involved in community organizations at this point, because I don’t know what else is left. Think about these places that you love and want to keep them around for your grandkids.”\n",

    "content": "Editor’s Note: This CNN Travel series is, or was, sponsored by the country it highlights. CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy.\nTurkey is the final stop for one of the most famous train rides in the world, the Orient Express. But another journey – the Dogu Express, or Eastern Express in English – is making the country one of the world’s leading rail destinations.\nHistorically a commuter train from Ankara to Kars, the train has gone viral among Turkish influencers in recent years for its stunning scenery through the east, full of off-the-beaten-path treasures.\nBerry Romo, a travel influencer who has been living in Turkey for over a decade, notes that “the train was already quite popular among locals and Turkish travelers, but barely known among foreign tourists.”\nIn response to the growing demand, the commuter service was, in 2019, turned into a tourist route. The 30-plus hours sleeper train runs from bustling capital Ankara to the sometimes snowy wonderland of Kars – a distance of 1,310 kilometers (814 miles) – with stops along the way where city excursions are organized.\nHowever, tickets are notoriously hard to come by. Passengers say they often sell out within minutes.\n“The trick is to check the website as soon as it’s midnight and buy when the website refreshes,” Romo said.\nTurkish travel agencies usually buy large quantities of tickets to resell for tours they organize, ensuring their clients a place on the train, which is why, according to locals, tickets are gone so soon. Individual tickets can only be bought a month in advance, making them a coveted prize for the few who get them.\nAt first glance, Ankara might seem less glamorous than better-known Istanbul, but the political center of the country is a worthy destination in its own right.\nTop sites include the Ataturk mausoleum, the final resting place of modern Turkey’s founding father, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.\nThe complex is divided into four parts. Highlights include Peace Park, with a Turkish flag composed of pebble stones surrounded by a flower bed, and the Ceremonial Plaza which leads up to the Hall of Honor that houses the tomb of Ataturk.\nThough Ankara embarked on a rapid pace of development after becoming the country’s new capital overnight in 1923, there is still some historical charm to be found among its old neighborhoods.\nInside Turkey’s ‘hidden’ ski world\nUlus is the old quarter of the city where there are Roman ruins, preserved passageways and even an old castle, perched on a hill, offering sweeping panoramic vistas of the surrounding scenery.\nWithin Ulus lies Sanat Sokağı, or Arts Street, a stretch of restored Ottoman houses that have been converted into cafes leads to courtyards filled with stalls selling handicrafts and Ottoman-era souvenirs.\nFor a more contemporary experience, head to CemModern, a new art gallery hosting global exhibitions in a restored railway depot. The cultural events here are varied, ranging from movie screenings to group yoga sessions and design markets.\nThe Dogu Express departs around early evening and, as it pulls away from the art deco Ankara railway station, the view out the window quickly morphs from sprawling metropolis to sweeping vistas.\nSleeper cabins are fitted with two single bunk beds that can be converted back down to seats during the day, a mini-fridge and a sink. Travelers often decorate their compartments with string lights, scarves and candles.\nThis makes for “a great way to enjoy a beautiful landscape in a cozy way,” according to Romo.\nEarly the next morning, the train arrives in Ilic, a small village whose main draw is its proximity to Karanalik, or Dark Canyon. The Canyon is home to the breathtaking Stone Road, which clings to the canyonside when it’s not plunging into one of its 38 tunnels or negotiating terrifying turns.\nThe secret side of the Mediterranean – by boat in Turkey\nDespite a reputation for danger, the road regularly lures tourists with its stunning scenery. It offers dramatic cliffs and steep gorges, all with the Euphrates flowing below.\nThe train then descends further east, into the heartland of Anatolia. Netta Kalpan, a native Minnesotan who lived in the Black Sea coastal area of Trabzon and was used to harsh snowy winters, says she “didn’t realize how big, flat, and cold Turkey could be” before taking the train.\nYet, she describes the landscape as “stunning, mostly in its vastness.”\n“I kept trying to take videos out the windows” but felt “like I wasn’t able to capture how it really felt to see it,” she says.\nAs evening falls, the train pulls into Erzurum. Romo says visiting the city was “without a doubt, one of the best experiences” she’s had in Turkey for the city’s rich “history, culture, and extraordinary gastronomy.”\nErzurum is home to many different types of local cuisine, most famously, the Cag Kebab. Lamb is marinated for about 12 hours in onions, salt and pepper, then placed on a skewer and cooked over a wood fire before being wrapped in warm flatbread or eaten straight off the skewer.\nAfter Erzurum, there are only a few hours left on the Dogu Express before it arrives at its final destination, Kars.\nFamous for its winter wonderland landscape, its name is taken from the Turkish word for snow. The city is known for its unique architecture stemming from the days it was part of the Russian Empire.\nTurkish foods: 23 delicious dishes\nUmmu Altunas, a lawyer from Istanbul, likens visiting the east of Turkey to visiting an entirely “different country” from the more European west. This is partly, she says, because “east is home to many different cultures,” such as Kurds, Armenians and Assyrians.\nThe medieval city of Ani, the former capital of the ancient Kingdom of Armenia, is one such example. Just a short drive from Kars, majestic ruins dating back 1,600 years are open to tourists. Vast walls and well-preserved churches, all overlooking a deep ravine, offer visitors a journey back through time.\nAlthough Turkey’s eastern regions draw fewer tourists, locals are often eager to welcome visitors with traditional Turkish hospitality.\nKaplan says that one reason she loved living in the east of Turkey is because it was “gratifying to be around people who love where they’re from.”\nShe says she doesn’t mean to put down Istanbul, adding: “It’s easy to be proud of a place everyone agrees is one of the most magnificent cities in the world.”\nBut to embrace a place less frequented by travelers?\n“That feels special.”\n",

    "content": "The remains of the longest bony fish in the world, the rare deep-sea oarfish, have washed up on California shores only 22 times in the past 123 years. Now, three have washed up in just the past few months—and scientists don't know why.\n\"It may have to do with changes in ocean conditions and increased numbers of oarfish off our coast,\" said Ben Frable of the Marine Vertebrate Collection at Scripps, who worked with the NOAA Fisheries team to recover the latest oarfish found on a California beach last week and transport it to the Southwest Fisheries Science Center.\n\"Many researchers have suggested this as to why deep-water fish strand on beaches. Sometimes it may be linked to broader shifts such as the El Niño and La Niña cycle, but this is not always the case,\" Frable told Newsweek.\n\"There was a weak El Niño earlier this year. This wash-up coincided with the recent red tide and Santa Ana winds last week, but many variables could lead to these strandings.\"\nScripps Institution of Oceanography Ph.D. candidate Alison Laferriere found the latest oarfish on Grandview Beach in Encinitas and then notified Frable. It is smaller than the one recovered in La Jolla last August, which measured roughly nine to 10 feet long.\nThe oarfish, nicknamed the \"doomsday fish,\" is so strange and massive in size that some believe it might explain ancient legends of sea monsters. The oarfish's name could have originated from the \"rowing\" motions the fish make as they swim.\n\"They get washed up sick or dying—California is a bit of a hotspot, but they wash up in other places too,\" Professor Louise Allcock of the Ryan Institute at the University of Galway told Newsweek.\n\"Underwater footage often shows them slowly swimming vertically, head up, undulating the dorsal fin. This is thought to be a predatory stance that allows the fish to see the silhouette of its prey in waters above,\" Allcock said.\n\"There is additional footage of them swimming horizontally, undulating their whole body to move—like an eel.\"\nThe oarfish's more alarming nickname, the \"doomsday fish,\" came from the fact that they are regarded as harbingers of bad news in some places. The legend is that if you see an oarfish, it is a warning sign that disasters such as earthquakes are soon to occur.\n\"This moniker is derived from a manipulation of Japanese folklore that arose following the Fukushima disaster,\" Frable told Newsweek.\n\"In the two years prior to the disaster, about a dozen oarfish washed up in Japan, most hundreds of miles away from this area.\"\n\"In the aftermath, folks latched onto these strandings as an omen of the disaster,\" said Frable. \"Tenuous at best.\"\nIn 2019, researchers in Japan tested whether oarfish and other deep-sea animal strandings were linked to earthquakes or tsunamis, said Frable, but they found no correlation.\n\"But the name is too evocative to disappear,\" he said.\nOarfish have been known to grow up to 30 feet in length and are encountered worldwide, yet scientists know relatively little about their life and biology.\nThey generally live in the upper layers of the deep sea from about 300 ft to almost 3,000 ft underwater, where they primarily feed on krill using powerful vacuum nozzle-like mouths.\nThe Encinitas oarfish will receive a necropsy (an animal autopsy) so scientists can learn more about the biology, anatomy, genomics and life history of oarfishes. The specimen will then become part of the Marine Vertebrate Collection at UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography.\nScientists say collections like this one are vital for research on the evolution and ecology of fishes. They enable scientists to answer questions like when pollution or plastics began impacting our ecosystems. This collection at Scripps has more than 6,000 species and 2 million specimens.\nIf someone finds an oarfish on the beach, a Scripps spokeswoman said they should alert the local lifeguards. If in Southern California, she added, people can notify Scripps Institution of Oceanography at scrippsnews@ucsd.edu or (858) 534-3624, or in Los Angeles, the Natural History Museum of LA.\n",

    "content": "Editor’s Note: Relive SpaceX Starship’s sixth test flight here as it happened.\nSpaceX aborted a highly anticipated booster catch attempt Tuesday during the sixth test of Starship, the most powerful rocket ever built — just weeks after acing the stunning feat on the first try. But the mission went on to soar through new milestones during a roughly hour-long flight.\nThe nearly 400-foot-tall (121-meter) Starship system — which features the Starship spacecraft stacked atop the Super Heavy booster — lifted off around 5 p.m. ET from the company’s Starbase facility near Brownsville, Texas. President-elect Donald Trump was in attendance, joining SpaceX CEO Elon Musk for the event in another example of Musk’s increasing role in Trump’s orbit.\nRelated article\nPrada and Axiom Space unveil spacesuit designs for NASA’s Artemis III moon mission\nAfter firing up its 33 powerful Raptor engines and propelling the Starship spacecraft toward space, the Super Heavy booster separated from the spacecraft, reversed course and steered itself back toward the launch site. SpaceX planned to attempt a precision landing of the booster into the arms, or “chopsticks,” of the launch and landing structure — nicknamed “Mechazilla” by Musk — at the company’s Starbase facility. The company first pulled off the unprecedented maneuver during the fifth Starship test flight last month.\nHowever, this time “automated health checks of critical hardware on the launch and catch tower triggered an abort of the catch attempt,” SpaceX said in a statement Tuesday. “The booster then executed a pre-planned divert maneuver, performing a landing burn and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.”\nThe Starship spacecraft, meanwhile, fired up its own six engines before entering a coasting phase as it soared through space. The capsule briefly reignited an engine about half an hour later before bracing for reentry — the process by which it veers back into the thickest part of Earth’s atmosphere — and executing a daring landing.\nIt’s the first time Starship, a vehicle intended to eventually carry humans to the moon and Mars, has successfully ignited one of its Raptor engines while in space, according to SpaceX.\nThat’s a big deal, explained Garret Reisman, a former NASA astronaut who now advises for SpaceX.\n“They’re finicky little beasts — (the Starship rocket engines) — and it’s not so easy to light them up and shut them down and light them up again,” Reisman told CNN.\nStarship then aimed to test its limits as it headed toward splashdown in the Indian Ocean.\n“We’re going to fly the ship at an aggressive angle of attack once it’s moving slower than the speed of sound,” SpaceX engineer Jessie Anderson said on the company’s livestream. “This means we’ll be flying nose down instead of our usual belly flop orientation during final descent. This will — no doubt — stress the limits of the flaps’ ability to maintain control, but it will be a chance to get real flight data on what our limits actually are.”\nFOR SUBSCRIBERS\n‘Possibility of a catastrophic failure’: Inside the space station leak problem that has NASA worried\nThe “flaps” are small wings attached to the side of the Starship vehicle meant to brace the winds of reentry and help slow the vehicle down.\nThe company had also removed some protective shielding off the vehicle to see whether the Starship could survive without it.\nStarship made a safe landing in the Indian Ocean and remained intact despite the rough landing trajectory.\n“Turns out the vehicle had more capability than our calculations predicted, and that is why we test like we fly,” SpaceX engineer Kate Tice said on the livestream for the event.\nThis uncrewed trial marked the fastest turnaround time yet in SpaceX’s test campaign for Starship, which will play a key role in NASA’s cornerstone Artemis program. Aiming to put boots on the moon as soon as 2026, the space agency plans to use the rocket’s upper stage, the Starship spacecraft, as a lunar lander ferrying astronauts to the moon’s surface.\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson referenced Starship’s significance to the Artemis program when congratulating the company on Tuesday’s test flight.\n“Congrats to @SpaceX on Starship’s sixth test flight. Exciting to see the Raptor engine restart in space — major progress towards orbital flight. Starship’s success is #Artemis’ success. Together, we will return humanity to the Moon & set our sights on Mars,” Nelson posted on X after Starship’s splashdown.\nThe goal of these test flights is to hash out how SpaceX might one day recover and rapidly refly Super Heavy boosters and Starship spacecraft for future missions. Quickly reusing rocket parts is considered essential to drastically reducing the time and cost of getting cargo — or ships of people — to space.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial rocket launches, said it did not have to undertake the lengthy process of reviewing a launch license alteration because the flight path of this week’s flight was expected to closely mimic an earlier test.\n“The FAA determined SpaceX met all safety, environmental and other licensing requirements for the suborbital test flight,” the agency said in a statement. “The FAA determined the changes requested by SpaceX for (Tuesday’s test flight) are within the scope of what has been previously analyzed.”\nRelated article\nNASA astronauts on readjusting to life on Earth: ‘It’s hard to sit’\nThe fifth integrated test flight of Starship launched on October 13, garnering international attention with SpaceX’s ambitious attempt to maneuver the 232-foot-tall (71-meter) Super Heavy back to a gargantuan Mechazilla landing structure.\n“Starship’s fifth flight test was a seminal moment in iterating towards a fully and rapidly reusable launch system,” the company said in a statement.\nStarship is considered crucial to SpaceX’s founding mission of eventually carrying humans to Mars for the first time.\nFor NASA’s Artemis program, SpaceX has government contracts worth up to nearly $4 billion to complete the task of developing a cost-effective space transportation system.\nGreg Autry, the associate provost for space commercialization and strategy at the University of Central Florida, said Starship operations Tuesday evening “looked really good.”\nAutry said SpaceX might have opted for a sea landing of the booster out of an “abundance of caution,” with Trump and Musk in attendance.\n“I don’t know what the decision-making process was yet of the failure mode or maybe they just want to be careful not to kill the president-elect of the United States by any chance,” he told CNN.\nAutry is a rumored candidate for Trump’s NASA administrator pick. In a statement to CNN on Tuesday, the Trump campaign said, “President-Elect Trump is making decisions on who will serve in his second Administration. Those decisions will continue to be announced by him when they are made.”\nDuring the fourth integrated Starship test flight in early June, the spacecraft endured significant damage. The vehicle shed numerous heat tiles designed to shield it from intense temperatures caused by the pressure and friction of reentry.\n“Because of lost tiles … the forward flaps were so melted it was like trying to control it with little skeleton hands,” Musk said after that mission, adding that the fourth flight landed roughly 6 miles (9.7 kilometers) away from its intended splashdown site in the Indian Ocean.\nSpaceX made significant strides, however, during Starship’s fifth integrated test flight in mid-October.\nAhead of that mission, SpaceX implemented what it called a “complete rework of (Starship’s) heatshield, with SpaceX technicians spending more than 12,000 hours replacing the entire thermal protection system with newer-generation tiles, a backup ablative layer, and additional protections between the flap structures.”\nRelated article\nNASA launches mission to investigate a potentially habitable ocean world\nTuesday’s milestones could cue up SpaceX to begin tackling more ambitious projects, and it remains to be seen how the aborted attempt of the booster catch will factor in to those next steps.\n“In 2025, SpaceX plans to undertake a long-duration flight test and a propellant transfer flight test,” according to a recent report from NASA’s Office of the Inspector General, or OIG.\nDemonstrating the ability to launch a Starship into orbit and then rendezvous the spacecraft with a tanker carrying fuel is considered essential to the success of NASA’s Artemis program.\nFor the human moon landing mission, called Artemis III, Starship may need to dock with more than a dozen fuel tankers before continuing its mission to the lunar surface.\nSpaceX will also face a “critical design review” for the Artemis III mission next summer, according to the OIG.\nSign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\nCNN’s Kristen Holmes, Tori Powell and Ross Levitt contributed.\n",

    "content": "Migration and innovation are hot-button issues the world over. Amid rapid change, there are calls to slow or halt both the movement of people and the growth of new technologies. As a human being, I understand the fear of rapid change. But as an immigrant and an entrepreneur, I have also seen up close how powerfully these forces can advance human flourishing.\nI was born in another country—both physically and philosophically. My first language is not English, and the social and political systems I was born under would be unfamiliar to most Americans. Yet as an immigrant to the United States, I also share its most common origin story. And as a technology entrepreneur who believes in the transformative power of decentralized blockchains, I'm following in the footsteps of those who left their birthplaces for a new homeland, where they invented new technologies and spread new ideas.\nMy story is both unique and universal.\nIn the 1980s, my native Hungary was under the heavy thumb of Soviet communism. It was a place where individual enterprise was stifled by a government that valued conformity over innovation. It's hard for people born and raised in the U.S. to truly understand what it was like to live in Eastern Europe—in a place that saw three revolutions in three adjacent countries over a decade, as the specter of Russian domination loomed next door. Eventually, my parents made the decision to leave.\nThe contradictions of my early life shaped the path I have traveled since. Exposed, up close and at an early age, to the tyranny and intellectual stagnation of centralized systems of control, I pursued avenues of personal growth and exploration wherever I could—through human connection, the arts and technology.\nAt every turn, my family supported and challenged me. My father, whose successful trucking business kept him on the road for most of the year, was a key figure in my life. When he was home, our house became a nexus of discussion about technology, philosophy and the future.\nWe spoke of cloud computing and artificial intelligence at the dinner table more than a decade before most of the world would hear those terms. My father saw in technology a vast new frontier. He saw values of individualism and capitalism driving a new kind of revolution—not political but technological—in data, automation, and finance.\nIn our adopted state of Ohio, my parents, ordained pastors who met in the seminary, poured their energies into building a Presbyterian church. They built an orchard and 15 greenhouses, a reflection of the unyielding work ethic they instilled in my brothers and me. For them, labor was love. Faith was a path to freedom and service; it was not about blind obedience but reason, choice and the beauty of the individual.\nMy brothers and I were encouraged to read voraciously, to think critically and to \"go outside\"—to always stay in tune with the world to understand how it was evolving. Dostoevsky, whose banned works my parents had secretly shared and discussed back in Hungary, was a particular lodestar.\nI almost ended up pursuing a career in music. Between the ages of 16 and 18, I was heavily invested in drumming and seriously considered climbing the ladder of international courses and competitions. But I was ultimately drawn to technology. Its underlying logic, and seemingly endless potential, fascinated me.\nEventually, I studied computer science at the University of Akron. There, I fell headfirst into open-source software and became \"red-pilled\" on the power of startups and entrepreneurship.\nAfter college, I managed to raise some VC funding and founded my first company. That first venture taught me resilience; I discovered that building something from scratch was as much about endurance as it was about ingenuity. A second startup, focused on AI tooling built on a very early version of ChatGPT, showed me the power and potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning.\nThen I discovered blockchain.\nFor me, blockchain was a revelation. Here was a technology that tied the various strands of my intellectual and professional journey together. A technology that could make centralized abuse of authority, of the kind my parents had fled from in Eastern Europe, impossible. A technology that could open up the benefits of finance to people all around the world.\nI saw it as the ultimate open-source project. Crypto offered a new way to create value, one that didn't rely on traditional, gate-kept VC funding models. Whereas conventional startups raised millions of dollars to develop proprietary products behind closed doors, crypto was open-source by nature. The code is available for anyone to use, fork and improve. Value isn't captured through ad revenue or data mining but through the token itself. Users who contribute to the ecosystem are rewarded directly, creating a self-sustaining economy that grows as the network expands.\nWhen I founded my current project, I considered applying to the venerable accelerator Y Combinator. Instead, I joined the Avalanche ecosystem, drawn by its vision for a decentralized world and its technical approach to scalability.\nIn an important way, this brings me full circle, back to the values of independence and self-sufficiency my parents instilled in me. They left their homeland so that I could grow up in a place of opportunity and instilled in me their belief in the primacy of the individual. Now, I am continuing to drive that vision forward across the ever-expanding horizon of decentralized technology.\nSteven Gates is CEO of Multisig Labs, the creator of GoGoPool, a decentralized staking protocol on Avalanche founded to simplify the process of launching and validating layer-one blockchains.\n",

    "content": "An \"entire regiment\" of more than 1,000 soldiers left the 20th Guards Motor Rifle Division of the Russian Armed Forces stationed in Volgograd amid rising tensions in the Russia-Ukraine war, according to the Russian investigative outlet iStories.\nAmong those who deserted the division, also referred to as \"sochniks,\" which translates to \"those who left their unit without permission,\" were 26 junior officers, a major, and two lieutenant colonels. Newsweek reached out to the Ministry of Defense for the Russian Federation for comment via email.\nMoscow is continuing to see high numbers of troops lost in battle, as Kyiv reports that 724,050 dead and wounded, and a recent daily average of around 1,500 casualties has become a pattern. Newsweek has yet to verify these figures.\nThe revelation that a large number of men deserted this division came after the outlet received a document, compiled by the command in April, from an unidentified source. It listed the names of those who left more than 1,000 days into Russia's war with Ukraine, as reported by the independent news outlet Meduza.\nThe list of those who left includes individuals' names, birth dates, patronymics and more, and identifies contract soldiers, mobilized soldiers, and conscripts.\nThe list names 858 contract soldiers, 150 mobilized soldiers, two conscripts, 26 junior officers, a major, two lieutenant colonels, and more.\nAs of September 2022, the maximum punishment for desertion from the armed forces under Article 338 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation is 15 years in prison.\nSince February 2022, 11,700 cases of unauthorized abandonment of a unit‎ reached military courts, and the number of cases reaching the courts each month began increasing in March of last year, reaching a new high in nearly 1,000 cases per month in July 2024.\nSoldiers who have been taken to military courts for unauthorized desertion are \"more likely to receive suspended sentences than those convicted under other articles,\" as a suspended sentence allows soldiers to return to the front lines sooner.\nThe headquarters of the 20th Guards Motor Rifle Division, located in the Kherson International Airport in the village of Chornobaivka, had been the subject of eight Ukrainian shelling attacks by March 2022.\nMikhail, a 28-year-old soldier who fled the army, told the outlet that the Ukrainian attacks resulted in approximately 500 deaths within the division in the summer of 2022, and many soldiers also deserted the division.\nMikhail said: \"Everyone was tired, no one liked it. For example, we were in one place, north of Alexandrovka, and there was a front line along the canals. And you walk a kilometer [0.6 miles], and there is no one,\" the serviceman added. \"On\none side of this kilometer, there are two people, on the other—three or four, that is, there was no front line as such. That is why mobilization was declared in principle.\"\nAlthough the loss of more than 1,000 men from this one division seems high, iStories said that Russia has at least two-dozen divisions participating in the war.\nNearly three years into the war with Ukraine, this is not the first time Russian soldiers have defected from their units in large numbers.\nThe Ukrainian military previously said that more than 18,000 Russian soldiers from the Southern Military District abandoned their posts, and Russia hit a new spike in desertions in July.\nRussia has begun outsourcing its military command with the deployment of more than 10,000 North Korean soldiers to the front lines in eastern Russia.\n",

    "content": "China is expected to lose over 50 million people in the next decade as its population decline accelerates, according to a new analysis.\nBy 2025, China's population is projected to drop from its 2021 peak of 1.41 billion to 1.36 billion, Ada Li, a senior industry analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a forecast based on United Nations data.\nChina's efforts, including ending its decades-old one-child policy in 2016 and increasing the cap to three children in 2021, have failed to reverse its declining birth rate. Official data from 2023 revealed births dipped for the seventh consecutive year, with deaths outnumbering births for the second year in a row.\nThe long-term outlook is even grimmer. The United Nations estimates China's population will shrink by 50 percent by the end of the century. The Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences earlier this year predicted an even steeper 60-percent drop.\nLi noted that 2024, a dragon year in the Chinese calendar, could boost births temporarily as the year is considered auspicious. However, she cautioned that zodiac-related birth increases have historically been short-lived and pointed to the sharp decline in marriages as a cause for concern.\nMarriage strongly correlates with births in China and other East Asian societies.\n\"Policymakers are likely to step up the pace of reform as they take aim at the barriers standing between reproductive-age couples and their desire to build families,\" Li said.\nDemographer Yi Fuxian of the University of Wisconsin-Madison has previously cast doubt on dragon years, pointing out they have generally had a negligible effect on births in China in recent decades.\nNewsweek reached out to the Chinese Foreign Ministry with a written request for comment.\nExacerbating China's demographic challenges is its rapidly aging population. Yi has predicted that those aged 60 and older could make up 40 percent of the population, a trend that could weigh heavily on economic productivity.\nBy 2035, China's dependency ratio—the proportion of dependents to the working-age population—is forecast to reach 53 percent, up from 46 percent in 2021, according to a January report from the Economist Group's Economist Intelligence Unit.\nStarting next year, the government will raise the statutory retirement age for the first time in a bid to encourage older Chinese to keep working.\nChina's neighbors South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan are facing the same demographic headwinds. South Korea, which has the world's lowest fertility rate at 0.72 births per woman, has spent hundreds of billions of dollars to encourage child-rearing and is even launching a new government ministry dedicated to its population crisis.\n",

    "content": "Bitcoin has been on a meteoric rise in 2024, reaching a new all-time high of $93,495 on Wednesday, November 13. As the flagship cryptocurrency inches closer to the $100,000 mark, investors and analysts are debating: will Bitcoin hit this target by the end of this year?\nThe crypto community is abuzz with cautious optimism. Institutional support, favorable political developments on the back of Donald Trump's election win including the promise to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, and strong market fundamentals are fueling bullish sentiments. However, concerns over market structure, potential short-term corrections, and timeline uncertainties temper the enthusiasm.\nOne of the most significant factors propelling Bitcoin's surge is the influx of investment. Financial giants like BlackRock have not only added Bitcoin to their balance sheets but have also initiated Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), attracting record inflows of $2.6 billion shortly after the U.S. election.\n\"If you take into account the fact that large companies like BlackRock and other major financial institutions are holding the asset on their balance sheets, this is a much different reality than any other previous cycles for the asset,\" J.D. Seraphine, CEO of crypto-based AI validation platform Raiinmaker, told Newsweek.\nThe approval and adoption of Bitcoin ETFs have provided traditional investors with easier access to the cryptocurrency market. This institutional endorsement is seen as a validation of Bitcoin's legitimacy and long-term potential.\nOf course, the recent presidential victory for Trump has been viewed as a positive catalyst for Bitcoin's price trajectory. Many in the crypto industry anticipate that a Trump administration will usher in more crypto-friendly regulations.\n\"Trump's victory has certainly accelerated price movement in the cycle,\" Seraphine noted. \"There certainly is a great deal of hype surrounding Trump coming into office and creating regulatory clarity for cryptocurrency in the U.S.\"\nGabriele Giancola, CEO of Qiibee, echoed this sentiment, saying to Newsweek: \"Bitcoin's performance historically aligns with significant geopolitical and economic events, and the aftermath of the U.S. election could see BTC reaching $100,000 this year or shortly after a potential Trump reelection.\"\nThis is even inspiring other politicians globally to get in on Bitcoin. Polish presidential candidate Sławomir Mentzen has pledged to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve if he wins the 2025 election.\nHowever, not everyone is convinced that political developments alone will sustain Bitcoin's rally. Lorien Gamaroff, CEO and co-founder of Bitcoin wallet and payment platform Centbee, cautioned against over-reliance on political figures. \"But can the crypto community afford to put its hopes in a leader whose track record is filled with broken promises?\" he wrote in a recent LinkedIn post.\nBitcoin's reduced issuance rate due to the recent halving event has tightened supply, while demand continues to grow. A Bitcoin halving event is when the reward that miners earn for creating new blocks of Bitcoin is cut in half. This happens roughly every four years or after 210,000 blocks are mined.\nTrading volumes have reached record highs, and volatility has decreased compared to previous bull runs, indicating a more mature market. Historical patterns suggest that once Bitcoin surpasses its previous all-time high, it often experiences significant gains.\n\"If you study the price history of BTC, it follows a very predictable pattern,\" Seraphine explained. \"Once it crosses the previous all-time high, it historically hits levels multiples above that previous all-time high.\"\nDespite the bullish indicators, experts warn of potential factors that could slow or reverse this growth. Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com, posted on X last week: \"Leverage needs to be cleaned up before an attack on $100K. Please manage your risk carefully.\"\nThese caveats aside, Marszalek is all in. \"All nations should sell their useless gold reserves and buy bitcoin,\" he posted on November 15.\nHowever, a large options expiry of $11.8 billion on December 27 could introduce volatility and affect price dynamics, according to BNC. This is the date when cryptocurrency options contracts—derivatives that give traders the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell an asset at a specific price—reach their expiration date.\nGiancola pointed out the possibility of a short-term correction: \"With the rapid price increases we've witnessed recently, a short-term correction within the next one-two months is plausible.\" However, he remains optimistic about the long-term prospects: \"That said, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains extremely strong.\"\nWhile the consensus leans toward Bitcoin eventually reaching $100,000, experts are divided on the timeline. Predictions range from hitting the mark by the end of 2024 to early 2025.\nWhile there's strong agreement on Bitcoin eventually reaching $100,000, there's a split between those who see it happening in 2024 versus early 2025. Most experts emphasize this is more about \"when\" rather than \"if,\" but caution about potential corrections along the way.\nThe sentiment appears to be that, while short-term volatility and corrections are likely, the fundamental and institutional factors supporting Bitcoin's growth are stronger than in previous cycles.\n",

    "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\nA species of marine worm that scientists lost sight of for almost 70 years has finally resurfaced, thanks to some eagle-eyed sleuthing and a seahorse less than an inch long. When researchers analyzed images of tiny seahorses taken by scuba divers, they found evidence of photobombing worms in the hundreds, living alongside the seahorses in coral colonies from Japan to Australia.\nThe long-lost worm is Haplosyllis anthogorgicola, a species of bristle worm, or polychaete. It typically measures no more than 0.24 inches (6 millimeters), and it burrows inside branching gorgonian corals at a density of up to 15 worms per cubic centimeter. But the creature hasn’t been directly observed in the wild since 1956, when Kyoto University marine biologist Huzio Utinomo first identified it, scientists reported Wednesday in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences.\nRelated article\n‘Mystery mollusk’ found in the ocean’s midnight zone is unlike anything researchers have seen before\nFinding these worms is extremely challenging because their small size and near      transparency make them almost impossible to see underwater, said lead study author Chloé Fourreau, a doctoral student in the Molecular Invertebrate Systematics and Ecology, or MISE, Laboratory at the University of the Ryukyus in Okinawa, Japan.\n“I love that this paper crowdsources imaging from the public to learn more about where and how these animals occur and what they are doing,” said Karen Osborn, a researcher and curator in the department of invertebrate zoology at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC.\nWith about 10,000 named species of bristle worms and perhaps twice that number yet to be discovered, there are many open questions about polychaete biology, interactions with other species, “and the impacts they have on the areas they inhabit,” said Osborn, who was not involved in the study, in an email. “This paper beautifully shows how they are just below our noses, but virtually unnoticed.”\nStudy coauthor Ai Takahata, an undergraduate  student at MISE and Forreau’s lab partner, was researching the camouflage of pygmy seahorses (Hippocampus bargibanti) when she unexpectedly found several H. anthogorgicola worms in coral samples collected in waters near Japan.\n“When she cut a branch of the coral, she noticed some worms came out of it,”      Forreau said. “She gave them to me as she knew I was interested in polychaetes, but prior to looking at the worms, I didn’t even know about this species.”\nRelated article\nOceanographers find underwater mountain bigger than Mount Olympus\nForreau suspected that pygmy seahorses’ gorgonian coral colonies might yield more of the worms, she told CNN. In 2023, during an unrelated survey in southern Sukumo Bay in Kochi, Japan, she asked the boat captain to make a detour to sample corals, and she found H. anthogorgicola bristle worms inside them.\nBut as Forreau was sorting her underwater photos of seahorses and corals, she made another unexpected discovery: The worms’ coral burrows were visible in the images. Perhaps, she thought, that might also be the case in other photos of pygmy seahorses. She and her study coauthors turned to iNaturalist, a website where people share nature images and information on biodiversity, to find photos of pygmy seahorses (and possibly of their worm neighbors, too).\nBecause pygmy seahorses are so small — about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) long — divers tend to photograph them in extreme close-ups, which include detailed views of nearby corals. On iNaturalist, 489 photos of the seahorses also included evidence of worms, the researchers reported.\nImages of pygmy seahorses taken by scuba divers were crawling with worm photobombs. Worms’ limbs, heads and tails poked out of coral burrows in the hundreds; the scientists even counted seven examples of worms crawling on seahorses’ bodies. Worms’ tunnels snaked through coral branches and into polyps, and approximately 84 percent of the photographed corals were hosting worm infestations, the researchers estimated.\nPrior to this study, very little was known about H. anthogorgicola’s range and habits; piecing together the lifestyles of hard-to-find animals is especially challenging when published research about them is nearly nonexistent, Forreau said.\n“But our paper shows that we can repurpose the large information available on better known species to learn about understudied ones like worms,” Forreau added in an email.\nGPS coordinates on the iNaturalist photos expand the worms’ potential distribution much farther to the south than previously thought, encompassing Australia, East Timor, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Taiwan, according to the study.\nUtinomo’s 1956 paper linked the worms to just one coral species — Anthogorgia bocki — but analysis of the photos suggests that these worms inhabit other corals in the genus. The images also provided the first evidence of the worms interacting directly with seahorses.\nPolychaetes live in diverse habitats “including polar ice, methane seeps and deep-sea hydrothermal vents, the spaces between corals, and the vast open ocean,” Osborn said. “They are critical to food webs and build habitat for other animals.”\nThe iNaturalist photos answered some long-standing questions about H. anthogorgicola’s lifestyle and habits, Forreau added.\nRelated article\nScientists make surprise discovery of life in the seafloor’s ‘underworld’\n“They confirm that the worms are highly reliant on their burrows; most of their time is spent inside,” she said. In many of the images, the only visible part of a worm was its antennae and other trailing appendages poking out of the tunnel. “This position suggests that worms spend a lot of time sensing their environment around them, perhaps waiting for something to eat in the water, or to detect the coral polyp’s movement to steal its food.”\nHowever, many of the burrows were not close to polyps, hinting that the worms could be coral cleaners rather than food thieves.\n“There is still much to be learned about the relationship between the worms and the corals where they live,” Forreau said.\nMindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine.\n",

The iconic Avenue des Champs Élysées in Paris came in fifth place at $1,282.\nVia Monte Napoleone “is very short compared to Fifth Avenue, New Bond Street or Champs Élysees,” helping to drive rents higher, said Thomas Casolo, Cushman & Wakefield’s head of retail for Italy. He sees room for further rent increases as result. “The space is very scarce,” he told CNN.\nNow in its 34th year, the report tracks rents in 138 leading retail destinations globally. These locations face high demand for space and limited supply, even in an otherwise challenging retail market, according to Robert Travers, head of retail for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Cushman & Wakefield.\nLuxury and mass-market brands “are doubling down on their physical stores in the top locations, as competition for consumer attention drives the need for a superior shopping experience and product showcase,” he said. Vacancy rates are “exceptionally tight” as a result, translating into costly rentals.\nRelated article\nWealthy Americans are rushing to grab foreign passports following Trump’s win\nIn April, Gucci parent Kering paid €1.3 billion ($1.4 billion) to acquire a building on Via Monte Napoleone from a subsidiary of Blackstone. Chanel and Gucci have also opened new locations on the strip in the past year, which counts Hermès, Versace, Cartier, Bottega Veneta and Celine among its other residents.\nThe developments reflect a wider boom in luxury tourism in Milan, which hosts one of the world’s major annual fashion weeks, as well as a Design Week focused on furniture and interior design.\nMany high-net worth individuals have also relocated to the city, lured by simplified migration rules and generous tax incentives, according to a report this year by Henley & Partners, which helps the wealthy migrate.\nThe world’s 10 most expensive shopping locations, by rent per square foot, according to Cushman & Wakefield:\n1.

    "content": "A House Republican is pushing to ban transgender women from women’s restrooms at the US Capitol, two weeks after history was made with the election of America’s first out transgender person to Congress.\nSouth Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace on Monday introduced a resolution to amend the rules of the US House of Representatives less than two months before Democratic Rep.-elect Sarah McBride, a Delaware state senator, is sworn-in in January.\n“Sarah McBride doesn’t get a say. I mean, this is a biological man,” the South Carolina Republican told reporters on Monday, adding that the lawmaker “does not belong in women’s spaces, women’s bathrooms, locker rooms, changing rooms, period, full stop.”\nLater Monday, McBride wrote in an apparent response on X that “every day Americans go to work with people who have life journeys different than their own and engage with them respectfully, I hope members of Congress can muster that same kindness.”\nThe congresswoman-elect continued in another post: “This is a blatant attempt from far right-wing extremists to distract from the fact that they have no real solutions to what Americans are facing.”\n“We should be focused on bringing down the cost of housing, health care, and child care, not manufacturing culture wars,” she continued. “Delawareans sent me here to make the American dream more affordable and accessible and that’s what I’m focused on.”\nMace, pressed by reporters earlier in the evening on whether she was going after a marginalized person, told CNN, “This is a biological man trying to force himself into women’s spaces, and I’m not going to tolerate it.”\nShe continued, “I’m the first woman to graduate from the Citadel, the Military College of South Carolina. If some guy in a skirt came by and said, ‘No, that’s my achievement.’ I’m going to be there and standing in the way and saying, ‘Hell no.’ I’m not going to allow men to erase women or women’s rights.”\nOn Tuesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson said he is working to “provide accommodations for every member of Congress.” He refused to acknowledge specifics of the GOP’s plans and said, “This is an issue Congress has never addressed before.”\nIn the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022 and her party’s efforts to hold onto women voters, Mace – the first woman to graduate from the Citadel’s Corps of Cadets — has often said she’s looking for ways to show that the GOP is “pro-women.”\nMcBride, during her run in the reliably blue state to fill the seat vacated by Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester — who went on a successful Senate run — didn’t lean on the historic nature of her campaign. She emphasized her work leading a bipartisan push to pass paid family and medical leave in the state and touted support from unions and her work to raise the state minimum wage. But on the trail, she did allude to a broader theme of respect — specifically, that everyone deserves a member of Congress that respects them and their families.\nSimilar bans targeting trans people using bathrooms associated with their gender identities, particularly in schools, have sparked controversy in recent years – with supporters arguing that the measures protect students while critics say that they are dehumanizing and unnecessary.\nIn 2023, Republican-led legislatures in several states passed bills to ban transgender students from using locker rooms and bathrooms associated with their gender identities in what the Human Rights Campaign – the largest LGBTQ advocacy group in the US – called the biggest year for “bathroom bills.” The Ohio Senate last week  greenlit its own measure, which now awaits a signature from the state’s Republican governor.\nThis story has been updated with additional reaction.\nCNN’s Arit John, Jack Forrest and Karina Tsui contributed to this report.\n",

    "content": "One major reason Donald Trump will return to the White House is that he remained unexpectedly competitive with women in this month’s election.\nVice President Kamala Harris won a majority of female voters, but her 8-point advantage over Trump with them was only about half as big as President Joe Biden’s 15-point lead in 2020, according to the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN.\nBut even as women backed Trump in surprisingly large numbers, many of them continued to express significant hesitation about his style, agenda and potential impact on their rights and democracy itself, according to both the exit polls and AP VoteCast survey, the two principal surveys of voter attitudes in the election.\nMany women uneasy about Trump on all those fronts, strategists in both parties agree, put greater weight on their more immediate concerns, primarily about inflation but also secondarily about the border and crime.\n“The women who were most driven by abortion, health care, democracy and freedom and rights, which pulled it all together, chose Harris overwhelmingly,” said Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, chief strategy officer for Way to Win, a liberal group that focuses on electing candidates of color. “But in this election, the more brass tacks, immediate impact (issues) won the day.”\nIf there is any near-term path to recovery for Democrats, it will almost certainly begin with the women who remained ambivalent about Trump even as they helped return him to the White House.\nAs president, Trump faced persistent and widespread opposition from women. Over his first four-year tenure, his approval rating among women averaged just 35% in Gallup polling. That was well below his 48% average approval rating among men – and by far the worst showing across a full term for any 21st century president among women in the Gallup surveys, according to detailed results provided by the firm.\nTrump regained ground among women this year largely because so many of them were dissatisfied with the results produced by his successor, Biden.\nBut Trump’s provocative initial round of Cabinet nominations – including three separate figures who have faced serious allegations of sexual misconduct – points toward a presidency whose style and agenda could again strain his support from female voters. Almost everything Trump has done since his win suggests that his second stint in the White House could feature even more of the conflict, chaos and belligerence that alienated women, to a much greater degree than men, during his first term.  And that may be the one viable lifeline available to Democrats as they try to emerge from the disappointment of the 2024 results.\nViewed through the lens of gender politics, the biggest surprise on Election Day was not that Trump ran up the score among men but that he held down his losses among women.\nStrategists on both sides had expected Trump to improve on his 2020 performance with men after a campaign in which he had constantly surrounded himself with symbols of hyper-masculinity and conspicuously courted younger men through appearances on media outlets with large male audiences, like the Joe Rogan podcast. Trump delivered on those expectations by increasing his margin among men by 5 percentage points over 2020, according to the exit polls. The AP VoteCast survey, conducted by NORC for another consortium of media organizations, also showed Trump widening his edge with men by 5 points compared to its 2020 result.\nBut even with Trump’s gains among men, women still had greater leverage to decide the election’s outcome. Women have cast a majority of votes nationally in every presidential election since 1980, according to Census figures. While the Census data on 2024 won’t be available for months, both the exit polls and VoteCast agreed that women cast most ballots again this year – not only nationally but in almost all of the decisive swing states. That means if Harris had improved on Biden’s performance with women – or, in some states, merely maintained it – she could have withstood her decline among men.\nInstead, Harris unexpectedly lost ground among women.\nHarris’s lead among women, in fact, was the smallest the exit polls had recorded for any Democratic presidential nominee in the 21st century, except in 2004 when women backed Democrat John Kerry over George W. Bush by just 3 percentage points. (VoteCast produced a virtually identical result for 2024, showing Harris beating Trump among women by 7 percentage points, a little over half the 12-point lead that survey showed for Biden in 2020.)\nBlack women gave Harris overwhelming support, with both the exit polls and VoteCast showing her winning about 9 in 10 of them. But Harris ran slightly below Democratic expectations among most other groups of women. Both the exit polls and VoteCast showed her winning 57% of white women with at least a four-year college degree. That was a solid showing, but below the support level of three-fifths or more that many Democrats considered possible for her, especially after the sharp movement of those women toward Democratic candidates in the 2022 midterm elections.\nSimilarly, the exit polls showed Harris winning nearly three-fifths of single women; that too was a solid performance, but slightly below Biden’s showing with them in 2020. Many Democrats expected Harris to exceed the two-thirds support Biden recorded in 2020 among young women aged 18-29; instead, Harris slipped back to about three-fifths support among them, too.\nThe biggest disappointments for Democrats came among two other groups of women. Both the exit polls and the VoteCast survey found that Harris won exactly three-fifths of Latina women, down in each case from about two-in-three for Biden.\nWhite women without a college degree were an especially critical target for each side because they represent such a large share of the electorate, particularly in the three Rust Belt battlegrounds of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that, as usual, proved pivotal to the outcome.\nGiven the virtual certainty of Trump’s gains with men, Harris needed to improve at least slightly with these blue-collar women to hold Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – the three states Trump dislodged in 2016 from what I termed “the Blue Wall.” But she could not meet that test.\nNationwide, both the exit polls and VoteCast showed Trump beating Harris among those working-class White women by roughly the same two-to-one margin he carried them over Biden in 2020. In the crucial former Blue Wall states, the exit polls showed Harris basically replicating Biden’s support among these women from 2020, while the VoteCast had her slightly losing ground.\nThe principal explanation for Harris’ disappointing showing among so many groups of women isn’t hard to find. In the exit polls, even more women than men expressed negative views about the economy.\nPreviously unpublished results from the exit polls provided by the CNN polling unit underscore just how broadly that economic discontent reached: the share who described the economy as “not so good” or “poor” reached three-fifths among White women with a college degree, two-thirds among Black women, three-fourths among Latina women and nearly four-in-five among the White women without a college degree. Biden’s approval rating in the exit polls was lackluster to poor among all those groups except Black women as well.\nThe Harris campaign and other Democrats had hoped that two other dynamics would counter that widespread discontent over the economy and the outcomes of Biden’s presidency.\nThe biggest issue they were looking to was abortion. In the exit polls, big majorities of women in each of those groups said abortion should be legal in all or most circumstances. In the 2022 midterms, the first election after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision rescinded the nationwide right to abortion, the vast majority of women who support legal abortion voted for Democratic candidates, especially in gubernatorial elections across the swing states that again proved decisive this year.\nBut in this election, Harris could not match that support among voters who endorse legal abortion. Nationwide, about 1 in 4 women who said abortion should be legal all or most of the time voted for Trump, according to the exit polls. Trump won at least that many pro-choice women in all seven of the most hotly-contested swing states, the exit polls found.\nTrump’s insistence that he would allow states to set their own rules on abortion and reject a national ban may have helped him moderate resistance from pro-choice women. But strategists in both parties agree the biggest factor was that other issues eclipsed abortion for many of the pro-choice women who backed him.\nVoters “seemed to say in 2024, ‘I may not agree with some Republican positions on abortion, but I can look beyond that if they satisfy me on fiscal or border issues,’” Republican pollster Nicole McCleskey wrote in a memo released last week. “That was not the case in 2022 – the economy and border issues were likely not as ripe, and the Dobbs decision had an emotional shock value. It was a different case in 2024, as Democrats had failed for two additional years to heed voter concern over inflation and the border. And voters had ample time to absorb and reconcile the Dobbs decision in light of other issues impacting their daily lives.”\nThe new exit poll data from the CNN polling unit buttress that conclusion. Those results found that a strikingly large percentage of female voters who said that abortion should remain legal also expressed negative views about the economy. Trump won a significant share of those conflicted voters: 1 in 4 of the Latinas, nearly half of the college-educated White women and over three-fifths of the blue-collar White women who want abortion legal but were negative on the economy voted for him. (Only 1 in 9 of the Black women in that category backed him.)\nIf there is a single master key that explains Harris’ defeat in 2024, it might be found there, in the very large number of pro-choice women who backed Trump because they were disappointed by their economic experience over the past four years, and thought he could deliver better results for them.\n“I just think that for many women, self-interest as opposed to collective identity is the answer” for their decisions to support Trump, said Republican pollster Christine Matthews. “Is my self-interest my collective freedom of rights as a woman – or is my self-interest that I have to put my groceries on my credit card and cannot feed my family?”\nThe primacy of economic concerns also helps explain an equally striking finding from the new analysis of exit poll data by the CNN polling unit. Solid majorities of Black, Latina and college-educated White women described Trump in the exit poll as “too extreme,” as did over two-fifths of the White women without a college degree. But among the White women without a college degree who described Trump as “too extreme,” almost 1 in 5 voted for him anyway. So did 1 in 6 Latinas who called him too extreme and even nearly 1 in 10 White Women with a college degree who viewed him that way. (Only 2% of Black women who described Trump as extreme supported him.)\nJackie Payne, the founder and executive director of Galvanize Action, which studies moderate White women, said that women who believed Trump would deliver more economic security for their family actively resisted information that could make them uncomfortable about voting for him.\nEven if shown clips of Trump making threats in belligerent language that repelled them, or promising extreme policies that they questioned, “They thought he was just being hyperbolic,” Payne said. “They were choosing to believe a vision of him that was aligned with what they wanted to get out of him — a strong economy — and they were absolutely discounting anything that felt extreme as disinformation or hyperbole, even if he said he would do it.”\nWith Trump returning to the White House, though, it will be harder for voters ambivalent about him to avoid all the aspects of his political persona they don’t like.\nIt’s noteworthy that since Trump’s emergence as the Republican Party’s dominant figure, he and the GOP faced their biggest deficits among women while he was actually in the White House – and dominating the news. Biden’s 15 percentage point lead over Trump among women in 2020 was the largest the exit polls had recorded for any Democratic presidential candidate since Bill Clinton in 1996. In the 2018 midterm elections, Democrats amassed an overwhelming margin of 19 percentage points among female voters in the exit polls. That was even larger than the GOP advantages among men in their 2010 and 1994 Congressional landslide wins.\nBy contrast, Republicans kept their losses among women much more manageable not only in Trump’s victory this year, but also in the 2022 midterm elections. That year, the exit polls found that Democratic congressional candidates nationwide won women by exactly the same modest 8-point margin that Harris did in 2024.\nThose results reflected a critical dynamic: While Trump was out of the White House, voters increasingly viewed his presidency primarily through the lens of what they didn’t like about Biden’s - particularly the sense that both the cost of living and security at the Southern border had deteriorated since Trump left office.\nBut Trump famously never won positive job ratings from a majority of voters at any point during his first term – even as he delivered the conditions on economy and the border that many viewed more favorably against the backdrop of their discontent with Biden. The question for the GOP will be whether Trump’s support will recede again, particularly among the female voters ambivalent about him, once that backdrop is removed and he again takes center stage.\nEven amid his decisive victory, there are some warning signs on that front for Trump. In his initial round of nominations and appointments, Trump has empowered immigration advisers committed to aggressively pursuing his mass deportation plan; nominated anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to run the Health and Human Services Department; and picked a Defense secretary nominee who has said women should be withdrawn from combat roles.\nMany of these ideas could unsettle female voters. In the exit polls, only a little over one-third of female voters said they supported mass deportation of undocumented migrants, far less than the level of support among men. Polling by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center last year found that about 7 in 10 women believe children should be required to obtain vaccinations before attending public school. That majority includes about 8 in 10 of White women with a degree and about 7 in 10 of those without one, according to detailed results provided by Pew. If the Trump administration moves to restrict access to the abortion medication Mifepristone, as anti-abortion groups are urging, he could face pushback from the big majorities of women across racial and class lines who continue to believe abortion should remain legal.\nOf course, there’s no guarantee that even if Trump advances down these fronts, he will lose support among his ambivalent female supporters. Matthews says, for instance, that many of the blue-collar women who backed Trump might not recoil from Kennedy’s criticism of the medical system. Though many women are expressing unease about mass deportation, Trump’s claim that immigrants are driving crime may provide him considerable leeway to pursue his agenda, particularly among the blue-collar White women who proved most receptive to that argument. And, as many strategists point out, the women who moved toward Trump tend to be those who pay the least attention to conventional news sources – raising questions about how much they will hear or learn about much of what he does.\nAbove all, Trump will be well positioned to hold support from the women who ambivalently backed him if he delivers on their top priority: bringing down their cost of living.\n“Nothing trumps economic insecurity in America,” said Tresa Undem, who polls extensively on attitudes about gender for progressive organizations. “The inability to afford three meals a day, to pay rent, get medicine, literally live or die – that comes before all else. But voters are very impatient … they expect Trump to deliver economically. They expect to see material benefit in their lives – significant economic relief – in the next couple years.”\nDelivering that relief won’t be easy. Even though the rise in prices has slowed substantially over the past year, there’s no sign of prices actually falling (something, economists warn, could trigger a recession if it actually occurred). If anything, most mainstream economists believe Trump’s proposed agenda of broad tariffs and mass deportation will push prices higher.\nFernandez Ancona says that if women continue to feel economically strained after Trump takes office again, Democrats will have a greater opening to engage them on the other aspects of his agenda that still concern them – at least if the party can penetrate the non-traditional communications channels that offer the best way to reach many of those women.\n“Ultimately it’s a confluence” that could again weaken Trump’s position with women, Fernandez Ancona said. “If the cost(s) of every day goods don’t go down or continue to go up, if women can’t get Plan B and or abortion medication, or are seeing the effects of the vaccines that their kids can’t get, then I think we have a shot at holding him accountable for those things.”\nWhen Trump was first elected over Hillary Clinton, a volcanic eruption of shock and anger among female voters fueled the massive women’s march in January 2017 that set the tone for four years of Democratic “resistance” to his first presidency. Now, as Trump prepares for a second term that by all indications could be even more tumultuous than his first, the most that Democrats can probably hope for among women is a slow burn.\n",

    "content": "A new report relying on extensive historic data has found instances of voter fraud remain incredibly scarce despite alarm and concern over the potential for such activity to sway the 2024 presidential election.\n\"It's a criminal offense to commit ballot fraud, and most people don't want to go to jail. So that's a sufficient deterrent for almost everybody,\" Darrell West, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told Newsweek in an interview. \"It's probably a very small number of people who even attempt it.\"\nRepublicans have continually raised concerns about voter fraud during and following the 2020 presidential election. Donald Trump and his allies filed 62 lawsuits in various courts in an effort to challenge the election, many of those cases resting on claims of voter fraud.\nOf the 62 lawsuits, only one succeeded before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court overturned the initial ruling.\n\"Judges heard the cases, they reviewed the evidence—both Republican and Democratic judges,\" West said. \"There were judges appointed by Donald Trump, and they all reached the conclusion there was not widespread ballot fraud and the election was not stolen.\"\nBrookings reviewed more than the court cases in writing their report. In the report, titled, \"How widespread is election fraud in the United States? Not very,\" the authors reviewed historical data from the right-wing think tank The Heritage Foundation, which spearheaded the now-famous Project 2025.\nHeritage laid out cases in every state, creating the \"Election Fraud Database,\" which found 1,561 instances of voter fraud that resulted in 1,325 convictions. Of those, 20 cases were brought in 2024, with charges ranging from ineligible voting to false registrations, duplicate voting and ineligible voting.\nHowever, the full list of instances stretches back for years, with the earliest instance cited from 1982 (which included 63 individuals and an estimated 100,000 fraudulent ballots). Most of the instances included one offender.\n\"There are a few cases of election fraud in every campaign,\" West said. \"But it's not systemic. It's not widespread. It's generally not organized, and I don't think ever has affected the actual outcome, but people often pick on isolated cases and turn it into a systemic and widespread pattern.\"\nThe Brookings report noted that over the 25 years covering the bulk of the cases cited by Heritage, there were 36 elections held. In the case of Arizona—one of the states most closely watched following the 2020 election—that meant around 42.6 million votes cast with only 36 cases of fraud in total.\nPennsylvania, which many have pinned as the state that could very well decide the election, had over 100 million votes cast in 32 elections across 30 years and only around 39 cases of voter fraud.\n\"There have been allegations of widespread ballot fraud, but it's really not indicated by the Heritage database,\" West stressed.\nNewsweek reached out to the Heritage Foundation by email on Thursday for comment.\n",

    "content": "Iran has defied international demands to rein in its nuclear program and has increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog seen Tuesday by The Associated Press.\nThe report by the International Atomic Energy Agency said that as of Oct. 26, Iran has 182.3 kilograms (401.9 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60%, an increase of 17.6 kilograms (38.8 pounds) since the last report in August.\nUranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.\nThe IAEA also estimated in its quarterly report that as of Oct. 26, Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 6,604.4 kilograms (14,560 pounds), an increase of 852.6 kilograms (1,879.6 pounds) since August. Under the IAEA’s definition, around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% purity is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further, to 90%.\nThe reports come at a critical time as Israel and Iran have traded missile attacks in recent months after more than a year of war in Gaza, which is governed by Hamas, a group supported by Iran.\nAdding to the complexity, Donald Trump’s reelection raises questions about whether and how the incoming administration and Iran may engage.\nTrump’s first term in office was marked by a particularly troubled period, when he pursued a policy of “maximum pressure” against Tehran. He unilaterally withdrew America from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, leading to the sanctions hobbling the economy, and ordered the killing of the country’s top general.\nIran last week offered not to expand its stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60%, during a visit to Tehran by the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi.\nThe IAEA said during the meetings, “the possibility of Iran not further expanding its stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% U-235 was discussed, including technical verification measures necessary for the Agency to confirm this, if implemented.”\nThe report said that one day after Grossi left Iran, on Nov. 16, IAEA inspectors verified that “Iran had begun implementation of preparatory measures aimed at stopping the increase of its stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60 % U-235” at its underground nuclear sites in Fordow and Natanz.\nThe reports come ahead of this week’s regular IAEA Board of Governors meeting in Vienna. Western countries have been considering a resolution censuring Iran for its failure to improve cooperation with the agency.\nA senior diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said it is possible that the commitments made by Iran during the IAEA’s chief visit may not stand in case a resolution is passed. In the past, Iran has responded to resolutions by the IAEA Board of Governors by further enhancing its nuclear program.\nIran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but Grossi has previously warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the U.N. agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment.\nThe IAEA also reported that Iran has failed to take concrete steps as of now to improve cooperation, despite pleas by Grossi, who held talks last week with Mohammad Eslami of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and Iran’s reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian.\nHowever, Tuesday’s confidential report also said that during Grossi’s visit to Iran on Nov. 14, “Iran agreed to respond to the Agency’s concerns related to Iran’s withdrawal of the designation of several experienced Agency inspectors by considering the acceptance of the designation of four additional experienced inspectors.”\nIn September 2023, Iran barred some of the Vienna-based agency’s most experienced inspectors.\nThe report also said there was no progress thus far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data comes from IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in Isfahan in May 2023 — although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data and inspectors have not been able to service the cameras.\nLast week, Eslami warned that Iran could retaliate if challenged at the upcoming IAEA board meeting. Grossi acknowledged some nations were considering taking action against Iran.\nIn an effort to ensure Iran could not develop atomic weapons, world powers struck a deal with Tehran in 2015 under which it agreed to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. UN inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program.\nUnder the original 2015 nuclear deal, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, can maintain a stockpile of uranium of 300 kilograms and is permitted to use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges, machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes.\nA year after the U.S. withdrawal from the deal under Donald Trump, Iran started to gradually abandon all limits the deal put on its program and began enriching uranium to up to 60% purity.\n",

The semi-finalists then paraded in swimwear, before 12 of them advanced to an evening gown contest.\nRelated article\nSee the best — and most outlandish — national costumes from Miss Universe 2024\nThe final five contestants later faced questions on a range of topics, including leadership and resilience. When asked how she would live differently if nobody would judge her, Theilvig told the judges she wouldn’t change anything, saying, “I live by each day.”\nWhen later asked what she would say to those watching, Theilvig urged viewers to “keep fighting … no matter where you come from.”\n“I stand here today because I want a change, I want to make history, and that’s what I’m doing tonight,” she said.\nChidimma Adetshina of Nigeria finished as first runner-up and Maria Fernanda Beltran of Mexico was named second runner-up. Suchata Chuangsri of Thailand and Ileana Marquez Pedroza of Venezuela followed – with Pedroza, a 28-year-old mother, making history in the top five after the competition removed several restrictions in recent years.\nThis year marked the first time in Miss Universe’s 72-year history that women aged over 28 were permitted to enter. More than two dozen of the finalists were older than would have been allowed in previous years, with Malta’s Beatrice Njoya becoming the first and only woman in her 40s to reach the grand finale.\nThe age limit’s removal came amid growing calls for the pageant to modernize. Ahead of 2023’s contest, the Miss Universe Organization also lifted a longstanding ban on pregnant women or mothers, and women who are — or ever have been — married.\nDelegates for each country were selected via local pageants that license local rights from the Miss Universe Organization. This year’s contest saw Cuba, represented by Marianela Ancheta, take part in Miss Universe for the first time since 1967. Several countries, including Belarus, Eritrea and the United Arab Emirates, sent contestants for the first time, though in April the Miss Universe Organization moved to dispel a flurry of what it called “false and misleading” reports that Saudi Arabia was due to make its debut in the 2024 pageant.\nSome national-level contests were marred by controversies in the build-up to this year’s final — including Miss Universe South Africa, which saw Adetshina quit the competition (and later be selected to represent Nigeria) after questions around her nationality sparked a wave of xenophobic hostility.\nLast December, the director of the Miss Universe Nicaragua contest, Karen Celebertti, resigned just weeks after Palacios took the crown, amid charges of conspiracy and treason. She, along with her husband and son, were accused of involvement in a plot to overthrow the government.\nNeither Celebertti nor the Nicaraguan government responded to CNN’s request for comment.\n",

    "content": "After a year fraught with personal and professional turbulence, Rory McIlroy ended 2024 in his much-frequented happy place: the winner’s circle.\nA third career win at the season-ending DP World Tour Championship in Dubai on Sunday put the gloss on a sixth Race to Dubai victory for the Northern Irishman, who battled back tears as he discussed triumph on the 18th green at Jumeirah Golf Estates.\n“It means a lot. I’ve been through a lot this year professionally, personally,” McIlroy told Sky Sports. “It feels like the fitting end to 2024. I’ve persevered this year a lot.”\nVictory sealed the 35-year-old’s fourth title of the season after a pair of wins on the PGA Tour – a highly successful campaign by most golfer’s estimations, but McIlroy’s storied talent means many measure his seasonal success by majors.\nRelated article\nRory McIlroy thinks Donald Trump and Elon Musk could help PGA Tour and LIV Golf discussions\nThe world No. 3’s decade-long pursuit of an elusive fifth major crown was extended in devastating fashion at the US Open in June, as two late missed putts from inside four feet helped Bryson DeChambeau snatch victory from the jaws of defeat at Pinehurst.\nThe previous month, McIlroy had filed for divorce to end his seven-year marriage with Erica Stoll, but the golfer announced they had reconciled their differences on the eve of the US Open.\nThe couple were joined by their daughter Poppy for celebrations on the Earth course, with McIlroy giving thanks to his family for their support through what he believed to be the most emotionally draining season of his career.\n“Their support means the world to me,” McIlroy told reporters.\n“To be able to show Poppy what happened today and maybe some of the reasons why I’m not around all of the time because I’m working or practicing … it’s incredible that they were here with me this week and I’m excited to go celebrate with them.\n“It’s been quite the year, but I’m super happy with where I am in my career and in my life, and I feel like everything’s worked out the way it was supposed to.”\nBirdies at the 16th and 18th holes were enough to hold off late pressure from Denmark’s Rasmus Højgaard, lifting McIlroy to a two-shot victory at 15-under par overall.\nThe win saw McIlroy rewarded with a $5 million payday – $3 million as a winner’s cut of the tournament’s $10 million prize purse and an additional $2 million for winning the Race to Dubai (formerly the Order of Merit).\nA sixth win in the season-long competition saw the Northern Irishman match the haul achieved by late Spanish golf icon Seve Ballesteros, adding another layer of emotion and drawing him within two titles of Colin Montgomerie’s all-time record of eight.\n“I think everyone knows what Seve means to European golf and to Ryder Cup players,” McIlroy said.\n“(In the) European Ryder Cup locker room, all we have are quotes of Seve. We had a changing room with Seve’s shirt from ‘95, the last Ryder Cup he played,” he continued, wiping away tears. “For me to be mentioned in the same breath, I’m very proud.\n“Going to go for my seventh next year and try to chase Monty down,” he added.\n",

    "content": "The Boston Celtics handed the Cleveland Cavaliers their first defeat of the season on Tuesday, holding off a spirited fightback to record a thrilling 120-117 victory.\nThe Cavaliers became just the fourth team in NBA history to start a season 15-0, but a huge night from Boston star Jason Tatum ensured Cleveland left TD Garden with a ‘1’ in the loss column.\nTatum finished with 33 points, 12 rebounds, seven assists and two steals in an all-around performance.\nThe rest of the team shared the scoring burden for Boston, with a total of six players reaching double figures: Al Horford had 20 points, Derrick White 19, Jaylen Brown 17, Payton Pritchard 13 and Jrue Holiday had 11.\nWhite said after the game that the players felt the added excitement of hosting the only unbeaten team in the league, a team the Celtics ousted in the Eastern Conference Semifinals last season.\n“Everybody knew that they were undefeated and coming to our building,” he said. “And also, it’s an NBA Cup game, and we already lost one game, so it was a really big game in that aspect. So, we were all aware.”\nHot three-point shooting helped the Celtics open up a 17-point halftime lead, which swelled to 21 in the third quarter, but the Cavaliers fought back impressively, quickly closing the gap to two points.\nIt wasn’t enough to rattle the defending champions, however, who hung on for the win.\n“I’m happy how we fought back,” said Cleveland big man Evan Mobley, per ESPN. “That was the main thing that I can be happy about. I feel like we didn’t start the best. That was the main thing that really shot us in our foot, but overall, I feel like we played a pretty good game.\n“I think it was a good test, and from what I saw out there, we could beat anybody.”\nCavaliers guard Donovan Mitchell finished with a game-high 35 points to go with eight rebounds, while Mobley added 22 points, 11 rebounds and six assists.\nThe result means both teams are 1-1 in the NBA Cup, which concludes with the semifinals and final in Las Vegas in December.\nNBA Cup games also count towards teams’ regular season records.\nRussell Westbrook racked up a milestone 200th career-triple double in the Denver Nuggets’ 122-110 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday.\nThe 36-year-old is the NBA’s all-time leader in triple-doubles and is now 19 ahead of Hall of Famer Oscar Robertson in second place.\nWestbrook finished with 12 points, 10 rebounds and 14 assists, helping to fend off a late surge from the Grizzlies.\n“It’s a blessing,” Westbrook said of reaching the milestone, per AP. “I’m truly grateful to be able to play the game to do that. But I’m also appreciative of the ones who came before me.\n“Anytime we win and I get them (triple-doubles), I’m always grateful for that. It’s my favorite time.”\nWithout three-time reigning MVP Nikola Jokić for a third straight game due to personal reasons, Denver was led by Jamal Murray who finished with 27 points, four rebounds, six assists, three steals and two blocks.\nMichael Porter Jr. added 24 points and 11 rebounds.\nSanti Aldama had a team-high 28 points to go with 11 rebounds for the Grizzlies, who are still without the injured Ja Morant.\nThe Nuggets are now 1-1 in the NBA Cup standings, while the Grizzlies are 0-2.\nLos Angeles Lakers guard Dalton Knecht tied the NBA rookie record for three-pointers made in a game, sinking nine from behind the arc en route to a career-high 37 points.\nKnecht led the Lakers to a 124-118 victory over the Utah Jazz on Tuesday, the team’s sixth straight win and best run since February 2021, per AP.\nThe rookie’s performances this season left superstar LeBron James wondering how Knecht fell to No. 17 in the 2024 NBA Draft.\n“They didn’t ‘find’ DK,” James said of the Lakers’ scouting department, per ESPN. “The other 16 teams f**ked it up. Did anybody watch him? Sh*t. They just didn’t f**k it up. You don’t ‘find’ an SEC Player of the Year.”\nRodrigue Beaubois (2010), Yogi Ferrell (2017) and Keyonte George (2024) are the other three rookies to hit nine threes in a game.\nThe Lakers, the NBA Cup defending champions, improve to 2-0 while the Jazz fall to 0-2.\nAway team @ home team (winners in bold)\nCleveland Cavaliers 117-120 Boston Celtics\nDenver Nuggets 122-110 Memphis Grizzlies\nUtah Jazz 118-124 Los Angeles Lakers\nCharlotte Hornets 115-116 Brooklyn Nets\nNew Orleans Pelicans 91-132 Dallas Mavericks\nOklahoma City Thunder 104-110 San Antonio Spurs\n",

    "content": "Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple. Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being.\nMore than 800 million adults worldwide are living with diabetes, according to a new study in the journal The Lancet.\nThe global rate of diabetes was about 14% in 2022, the study found. Nearly 60% of adults age 30 or older who had diabetes did not receive treatment in 2022.\nOn World Diabetes Day, it’s important to understand this chronic disease, especially what we can do to prevent it. What are the health consequences? What steps can people take to prevent diabetes? How is it diagnosed? If someone is diagnosed, what treatments are available? And what lifestyle changes help everyone — both people diagnosed with diabetes and those who want to prevent it?\nRelated article\nHow sleep can affect diabetes risk, according to a new study\nTo help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner.\nCNN: Why is it important to prevent diabetes? What are the health consequences of having this condition?\nDr. Leana Wen: Diabetes is a chronic disease that has many health repercussions. Diabetes is the eighth leading cause of death in the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is the No. 1 cause of kidney failure and adult-onset blindness, the CDC reports. People with diabetes are two to four times more likely to develop cardiovascular disease compared with those who do not. It is also a top cause of lower limb amputations.\nRelated article\nDiabetes rates may surge in US young people, study finds\nCNN: How common is diabetes? Are some groups at higher risk than others?\nWen: To answer this question, you need to know that there are three main types of diabetes.\nType 1 diabetes is believed to be due to an autoimmune response that stops the body from making insulin. This hormone is crucial to managing blood glucose levels. People with type 1 diabetes have to take insulin every day. Most cases are diagnosed in childhood, though some can occur later in life. Risk factors include having a parent or sibling with type 1 diabetes. Doctors don’t know how to prevent people from developing this form of diabetes.\nType 2 diabetes is by far the most common type of diabetes. In the US, about 90% to 95% of cases of diabetes are type 2. In this form, the body doesn’t respond to insulin as well and cannot keep blood sugars at normal levels. Unlike type 1 diabetes, which typically develops quickly, type 2 diabetes generally emerges over multiple years, and many people may not know that they have it until they are tested for it.\nRelated article\nPeople with type 2 diabetes may benefit from exercising in the afternoon, study shows\nIn addition, type 2 diabetes is typically diagnosed in people 35 and older, though in recent years, there have been more cases in younger individuals — including children and adolescents. Risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes include being overweight or obese and living a sedentary lifestyle. Certain ethnic groups are also more likely to have type 2 diabetes, including African Americans, American Indians, Hispanics/Latinos and Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders, and a family history of first-degree relatives with type 2 diabetes is a risk factor, too.\nAnother risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes is the third form of diabetes, which is gestational diabetes. This type is diagnosed during pregnancy in women who have never had the chronic disease before. It usually goes away after the birth of the child, but having gestational diabetes increases the risk of the woman later developing type 2 diabetes as well as the risk of the child developing type 2 diabetes.\nCNN: What steps can people take to prevent developing diabetes?\nWen: Here’s how to prevent the most common form of diabetes, type 2 diabetes.\nThe first step is to understand your risk of developing prediabetes, which is a condition that precedes being diagnosed with diabetes. The CDC has a useful calculator that will help you quickly assess your risk. Individuals at higher risk should speak with their primary care providers to see if they should be screened for diabetes and prediabetes, while individuals at lower risk should aim for healthy lifestyle choices to prevent these conditions.\nThese lifestyle choices include getting at least 150 minutes of physical activity a week. Those who cannot reach 150 minutes should keep in mind that some is better than none. Studies have shown that even half of the recommended amount can reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases.\nRelated article\nWalking could lower your risk of type 2 diabetes, and your speed may affect how much, study finds\nEveryone should work to reduce their consumption of ultraprocessed food. Aim to switch to whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes, and to cut out sugary drinks. People uncertain about the best foods can ask their physician for a referral to speak with a nutritionist.\nKeeping your weight in the healthy range also helps to reduce the risk of developing diabetes. Hypertension is twice as common in patients with diabetes compared with those without, and it’s also important to know if you have high blood pressure.\nAnother chronic condition that often accompanies diabetes is high cholesterol, and it’s important to know your cholesterol numbers, too. Thankfully, the same lifestyle changes that help to reduce the risk of diabetes also help to reduce the risk of developing these other ailments that, together, raise the chance of heart attacks and strokes.\nRelated article\nThere is a link between the meat you eat and a chronic disease, according to new research\nCNN: How is diabetes diagnosed?\nWen: Several different tests can help diagnose diabetes. An A1C test can measure your average blood sugar over the past few months, while blood sugar tests can be taken at random or after fasting for the night. All of these tests are readily available and should be started, for most people, at age 35. Some individuals may need to begin earlier depending on their risk factors. Your physician can order these tests; if that has not been done, consider bringing it up during your next clinical visit.\nRelated article\nPrediabetes: The younger you are, the higher the risk of dementia\nCNN: Once someone is diagnosed with prediabetes or diabetes, what treatments are available?\nWen: To prevent prediabetes from progressing to diabetes, individuals should aim to lose excess weight, become more active and eat healthier foods. They should also treat medical conditions like hypertension or high cholesterol that can increase diabetes risk.\nThose diagnosed with diabetes should work with their medical provider to identify the best treatments for them. There are a variety of medications available, which can be adjusted based on response and side effects. And they need to continue lifestyle modifications.\nRelated article\nUltraprocessed foods may increase your risk for type 2 diabetes, study shows\nCNN: What lifestyle changes help everyone — both people diagnosed with diabetes and those who want to prevent it?\nWen: We’ve already spoken about exercise. I want to underscore that it’s especially important for people who engage in mostly desk jobs; studies have shown that desk-bound workers need additional exercise to make up for their prolonged sitting.\nWe’ve also talked about the role of diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and keeping other medical conditions under control.\nRelated article\nThis type of plant-based diet helps battle diabetes and weight gain, study says\nAnother key lifestyle change to keep in mind is to stop smoking. People who smoke are 30% to 40% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes compared with those who don’t. Cutting smoking helps to reduce the risk of developing diabetes, and it also is very important for those who are already diagnosed with diabetes to stop smoking to decrease their chance of having heart attacks and stroke.\nFinally, understanding your personal risk factors is crucially important, as you may need more frequent and earlier onset of screenings depending on your risk factors. Considering bringing up diabetes on the next visit with your health care provider. Together, you can work out your risk and the steps you can take to prevent and to manage diabetes.\n",

    "content": "A Congressional panel recommended this week that the United States should major major changes to its trade relationship with China.\nIn its annual report to Congress released Tuesday, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission recommended, for the first time, ending permanent normal trade relations with Beijing.\nThe proposal aligns with recent calls by prominent Republican lawmakers, including Florida Senator Marco Rubio—President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for secretary of state—as tensions over trade with China are expected to escalate under the new administration.\nThe shift would require the U.S. to reinstate annual reviews of China's trade practices, providing greater leverage to confront what the commission described in its report as Beijing's \"unfair trade behaviors.\"\n\"This move would signal a shift toward a more assertive trade policy aimed at protecting U.S. industries and workers from economic coercion,\" the report said.\nThe recommendation is one of several outlined in a nine-page report by the commission, which was established in 2000 to assess the national security implications of the evolving trade relationship between Washington and Beijing.\nA congressional decision during the final year of the Clinton administration paved the way for China's entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001. The move was driven by the belief that integrating China into the U.S.-led global economy and fostering economic growth might encourage political liberalization in the country.\nThat vision never materialized, and the U.S.-China trade relationship shifted dramatically in 2018 during Trump's first administration, which initiated a trade war aimed at addressing trade imbalances.\nOn the campaign trail this year, Donald Trump pledged to impose 60 percent tariffs on Chinese goods in a bid to further reduce the trade deficit, a move that experts warn could weaken China's economy while increasing consumer prices in the U.S. The trade imbalance in 2023 stood at $279 billion, a significant drop from $418 billion in 2018.\nIn September, a group of Republican senators, led by Rubio, introduced legislation to terminate permanent normal trade relations with China, a status that currently minimizes trade barriers between the two nations.\n\"Giving Communist China the same trade benefits that we give to our greatest allies was one of the most catastrophic decisions that our country has ever made,\" Rubio said after introducing the bill.\nLast week, Trump tapped Rubio—a vocal critic of communism and a staunch advocate for a tough approach toward China—as his choice to head the State Department. Rubio's nomination will require Senate confirmation.\nThis article includes reporting from The Associated Press.\n",

    "publishedAt": "7:45 AM EST, Fri November 15, 2024",
    "content": "Climate change is impacting urban areas especially hard, and densely populated cities are suffering the most.\nThe urban heat island effect means that city temperatures can be several degrees higher than nearby rural regions. That’s because materials like concrete and asphalt absorb and radiate heat. Vehicles and air-conditioning units expel heat, and towering buildings block wind flow.\nOfficials across the globe are trying to cool cities down. In Chicago, which has a history of fatal heatwaves, more than 500 rooftops have been covered with vegetation, which releases cooling water vapor and acts as natural insulation for the building. Los Angeles, which has a vast network of freeways, has painted some of its roads with a solar-reflective material.\nBut detailed information about urban temperatures is scarce. That became clear to entrepreneur Jay Sadiq soon after he founded a startup in Abu Dhabi to modify asphalt to absorb less heat, when a potential client encouraged him to identify the hottest parts of the city, where the material would be most beneficial.\nSadiq couldn’t find the level of granular data he needed, so he started working on harnessing the information himself. Today, his company FortyGuard is focused on leveraging data and artificial intelligence (AI) technology to provide a detailed view of urban temperature dynamics.\nHe hopes that it will enable urban planners, chief heat officers, businesses, and real estate developers to make data-driven decisions, and residents to better plan their lives.\nExtreme heat can cause heat-related illnesses and death, particularly for vulnerable groups like young children and the elderly. Global heat-related mortality for people aged 65 and older increased approximately 85% between 2017 and 2021.\nAs billions of people move to urban areas in the coming decades, between half and three-quarters of the global population could be exposed to life-threatening extreme heat and humidity by 2100, according the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\nRising temperatures also makes it harder to sleep at night, and difficult to be productive during the day, especially for outdoor workers.\nAlthough urban heat is gaining more attention, most weather stations haven’t been built to specifically address the issue, and they’re often located at an airport or atop a hillside – areas that aren’t representative of the temperature on a city sidewalk.\n“Historically, most meteorological agencies would be tasked with monitoring the weather at scales larger than cities,” says James Voogt, a professor in the department of Geography and Environment at the University of Western Ontario, who is an expert in urban climatology.\nSatellites that measure surface temperature can cover wide areas but can’t provide detailed information about neighborhood hotspots. And trees and tall buildings can block satellites from recording temperatures at ground level. “It doesn’t see the shade underneath,” says Voogt.\nSome cities have started collecting information using sensors mounted on streetlights or buses, and others, including Hong Kong, have deployed dense urban meteorological networks. “But not many cities have such a dense measurement network,” says Chao Ren, an associate professor of architecture at the University of Hong Kong, who specializes in applied climatology and climate design.\nFortyGuard, which today has 16 employees and offices in Abu Dhabi and San Jose, California, collects 32 billion data points daily from third-party providers, but Sadiq says he can’t reveal much about their sources, given market competition.\nIt then uses AI to produce models that take into account variables that impact how temperature is felt – including a city’s elevation, vegetation, water bodies, and atmospheric conditions, such as cloud cover, to give a fuller view of local temperature dynamics, he says. “Our approach goes beyond measuring air temperature at a specific point in time,” Sadiq adds.\nSome of the company’s most robust information is about certain US cities, allowing it to model urban temperature for each 10 square meters, with 89% accuracy, according to Sadiq.\nFortyGuard offers advisory services, and it has worked with clients like Masdar City, an experimental “sustainable city” in the United Arab Emirates, to help it pinpoint heat hotspots to add trees and water features.\nRelated article\nOil-rich Abu Dhabi wants to be an AI leader. Aligning with the US is just the start\nBut the startup, which is “about to about to close a large funding round,” is aiming to position itself as a technology company, says Sadiq. He hopes to integrate its technology into existing platforms, like a real estate or map platform. That could enable homebuyers to figure out the least hot neighborhood in a city, or runners to determine the best route for a morning run, he says.\nTechnology platforms are already incorporating climate-related information from other providers. In late September, US real estate website Zillow announced that its listings would feature information such as wildfire risk, air quality and heat.\nOthers are applying AI to urban heat issues. In September, Google announced a new Heat Resilience tool, which applies AI to aerial and satellite images to help cities deal with extreme heat.\nVoogt and Ren said that it’s difficult to comment on FortyGuard’s urban heat intelligence without knowing more about its data sources, validation methods and technology. “The key element is how such AI is being trained and on what,” says Voogt.\nBut there is “definitely a need and demand for high spatial resolution temperatures in urban environments,” he adds.\nRen said what’s most important about urban heat information is how it will be used. While interest in urban heat is increasing, some places are doing better than others at addressing it, by educating residents about the issue, creating warning systems, or incorporating mitigation considerations into building codes or city planning.\n“The question is really, who will be the end user of your data, and who will put such urban heat information into their practices?” she says.\n",

    "content": "A sunspot currently roiling on the side of the sun is slowly turning to face toward our planet, possibly putting us in the firing line for solar flares and subsequent radio blackouts.\nThe sun fired out nine M-class solar flares on Monday, many of which originated from this active sunspot, named AR3901.\nNone of these flares headed towards the Earth, but the sunspot could release more flares when it is facing our way, possibly triggering radio blackouts.\n\"Solar flare activity has remained at high levels with ten M-Class, R1 (Minor) level flares over the period. Much of the activity has stemmed from Region 3901 (S07E63, Dai/beta-gamma) which remains difficult to analyze due to foreshortening near the east limb,\" NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) said in a forecast discussion.\n\"The region was responsible for the largest flare of the period, an M3.7 at 18/1253 UTC as well as a long duration M2.0 at 18/1915 UTC and ending at 18/1948 UTC.\"\nThe SWPC predicts that on Tuesday there is a 55 percent chance of M-class flares and a 10 percent chance of X-class flares, while on November 20 and 21, there is a 60 percent chance of M-class and 15 percent chance of X-class flares.\n\"R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are likely for the outlook period [November 18-24],\" it said in an Advisory Outlook.\nSolar flares are sudden, intense bursts of radiation from the sun's atmosphere caused by the release of magnetic energy. These flares are some of the most violent events in our solar system and can release energy equivalent to millions of hydrogen bombs.\nWhile solar flares don't physically harm Earth's surface due to our atmosphere, they can cause radio blackouts, as well as disrupt satellite communications and interfere with GPS systems.\n\"The radio blackouts are caused by disruption of the ionosphere by high energy radiation generated by the solar flare. The ionosphere is a layer of the Earth's atmosphere situated between 53 to 373 miles above the Earth's surface,\" David Wallace, an assistant professor of electrical engineering at Mississippi State University, told Newsweek.\n\"Radio waves are skipped off the ionosphere allowing them to be broadcasted around the world. During times of strong solar flare activity, the high energy radiation from the flares interacts with the atoms in the ionosphere, stripping off electrons from the atoms and creating an area with a high density of free electrons in the lower ionosphere. When the high-frequency radio waves make contact with the high-density areas of free electrons, the waves are absorbed, instead of being reflected. This causes the radio blackouts.\"\nDepending on the strength of the flare, these blackouts can last between a few minutes to several hours. Solar flares are categorized into five classes based on their X-ray intensity, ranging between A, B, C, M, and X. X-class flares are the most powerful and least common, with only 175 X-class flares being seen per 11-year solar cycle.\n\"It is believed that the most significant solar storm event happened in 1859 and is generally referred to as 'The Carrington Event.' Back then we didn't have critical digital infrastructure, similar to what we have today,\" Rami Qahwaji, a visual computing professor and space weather researcher at the University of Bradford in the U.K., previously told Newsweek.\n\"But an event similar to the Carrington Event happening today could result in between $0.6 and $2.6 trillion in damages to the U.S. alone, according to NASA spaceflight.\"\nDo you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?

He's at his highest trade value this offseason and the White Sox likely won't be able to extend his contract before it expires.\nMore than likely, the White Sox will wait until after the top free agent pitchers sign. Once those pitchers sign, there will be a lot fewer options for teams to pick up pitchers, therefore driving up the value of Crochet by quite a bit.\nESPN's Jesse Rogers polled a panel of 18 MLB executives and insiders, asking a variety of questions. One of the questions asked pertained to Crochet, stating, \"Which team will land Garrett Crochet if the White Sox trade him this winter?\"\nOf the 18 experts polled, five voted for the Mets, which was the most for a single team in the poll.\nThe same panel of experts predicted the Mets would sign one of the big three pitching free agents, Blake Snell, Corbin Burnes, or Max Fried. I wouldn't be surprised to see Crochet land in the Big Apple, either as a replacement for missing on those three or as a complement beside them.\nThe Mets are going to be very aggressive with their money as they try to sign Juan Soto and all the other top free agents. But they can look to add Crochet without having to deal out a nine-figure free agency contract.\nMore MLB: MLB Experts Expect Mets To Sign At Least One $100 Million Free Agent Ace\n",

    "content": "Editor’s note: Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel’s weekly newsletter. Get news about destinations, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, and where to stay.\nIf a steaming bowl of soup strikes you as the ultimate in old-fashioned comfort, you’ve got plenty of company.\nSoup is one of the world’s oldest and most universal foods, said Janet Clarkson, author of the book “Soup: A Global History.”\n“Every culture has some kind of soup,” she said. “It’s got very ancient roots.” Early people simmered it in everything from turtle shells to lengths of bamboo, she writes in the book, turning out metal soup pots starting in the Bronze Age.\nBoiling food made it possible to subsist on stable grains, with herbs and other ingredients added for nourishment or medicinal purposes.\nEach time you deliver a pot of hearty soup (with perhaps a side of bread) to a friend with the sniffles, Clarkson said you’re in fact carrying on an age-old tradition.\n“Separating food and medicine — that’s not how ancient people thought of it,” she said. “I think in every country in the world, historically, some soups were seen as restorative.”\nThat’s true no matter what you call it. Today, soup leans brothy while stews are more substantial, but the world’s spoonable foods have never fit neatly into the two English-language categories.\nWhile Clarkson dove into centuries of etymology to trace the history of soup, potage and broth, she settled on a generously broad take. “Just some stuff cooked in water,” she wrote, “with the flavored water becoming a crucial part of the dish.”\nIt’s a definition that leaves room for the world’s tremendous culinary diversity. These are CNN Travel’s nominations for 20 of the best soups around the world:\nFruits from the oil palm tree lend both fat and flavor to this soup from the Niger Delta, which also features fresh catfish, beef and dried seafood.\nIt’s so popular that packets of ready-mixed banga spice are sold in shops. Most blends include African nutmeg, castor seed, orima, jansa and beletete leaves.\nThese spices infuse a rich, red sauce that’s the soup’s main draw: Soak it up with eba or a ball of starch, two Nigerian staples made from cassava but prepared with different methods.\nBroth is simmered for hours with cinnamon, star anise and other warm spices to create a wonderfully aromatic base for this rice noodle soup. Pho is among Vietnam’s most recognized culinary exports, but the soup is a relatively new food, wrote Andrea Nguyen, author of “The Pho Cookbook.”\nAnd while today’s pho restaurants serve a wide range of flavors, beef is the original. By 1930, Nguyen explained, the soup was served with slices of raw beef cooked gently in the broth.\nToday, beef pho remains the most beloved version in Vietnam, with options that include the original raw beef, a mix of raw and cooked beef, brisket and tendon.\nChunks of tender beets swim in brilliant red broth for a soup that’s beloved in Ukraine and across Eastern Europe. Often topped with a rich dollop of sour cream, borscht is anything but basic beet soup. It gets a tangy kick from kvass, a lacto-fermented beet juice that’s another regional specialty.\nAnd while the soup is sometimes attributed to Russian cuisine, that claim is contested.\nIn 2022, UNESCO declared that borscht in Ukraine “unites people of all ages, genders and backgrounds at the table” and placed the soup on its list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding. And individual Ukrainian chefs are doing their part to make the soup a symbol of the nation.\nA fisherman’s stew turned culinary icon, bouillabaisse distills classic Mediterranean flavors into a dish synonymous with the coastal city of Marseille. Saffron, olive oil, fennel, garlic and tomatoes blend with fish fresh from the sea.\nAt one time, that fish would reflect each day’s catch, but things have gotten a bit stricter.\nAccording to signatories of the 1980 Bouillabaisse Charter — a collective attempt by local chefs to ensure the quality of the French soup — the most authentic recipe must include at least four kinds of seafood chosen from a list that includes monkfish and crab.\nRelated article\n20 classic French dishes everyone needs to try\nThinly sliced greens meld with potatoes and onions in this homey soup from Portugal’s wine-producing Minho region. Now, the soup is a culinary star from upscale cafes to rural kitchens, the definition of down-home comfort food.\nIn many versions, tender Portuguese chouriço sausage adds an undercurrent of smoky, salty flavor that makes the soup even heartier. Enjoy alongside a glass of Minho’s famed vinho verde wine.\nDurum wheat harvested while green, called freekeh, adds satisfying heft and nourishment to this North African soup, which is especially beloved during the holy time of Ramadan.\nThe tender grains absorb a tomato broth and aromatic spices, their flavor melding with chickpeas plus stewed chicken, beef, mutton or lamb. Serve with lemon wedges and a hunk of kesra bread.\nThis creamy shrimp chowder is a specialty of Arequipa, a historic city surrounded by towering volcanoes. Cold nights in the mountains are perfect for the hearty dish: Tender shrimp swim alongside chunks of Andean potatoes and corn.\nIt’s got a kick, too. The addition of ají amarillo, a chili pepper with a lilting, fruity flavor, adds satisfying spice to balance out the rich and creamy ingredients. Maybe that explains the soup’s reputation as a powerful aphrodisiac.\nSummer in Andalusia brings searing weather, ideal for cooling down with a bowl of this chilled vegetable soup. Today’s most classic version includes tomatoes, cucumbers, garlic and olive oil, with a handful of stale breadcrumbs added for body.\nArabs brought the dish to the Iberian Peninsula centuries before Spaniards tasted tomatoes, a New World ingredient. The original was a blend of bread, garlic and olive oil, pounded in a mortar and seasoned with vinegar.\nAs with so many culinary treats, groundnut soup ignores international boundaries: Meat, fish or chicken simmered into a thick peanut soup is pure comfort food in countries across West Africa. Versions range from Gambian domoda — the national dish — to a Nigerian take cooked with bitter, leafy greens.\nNo matter the country, such soups and stews are creamy, rich and salty, a satisfying combination that often gets a fiery jolt from the addition of Scotch bonnet peppers.\nCultures and flavors meld in a hearty soup that’s a star of Louisiana cuisine, influenced by West African, Native Choctaw and French cuisines. Versions made with seafood, chicken and sausage are among the most popular today, but there are myriad ways to make this Southern specialty.\nGround, dried sassafras leaves — called filé and long harvested by the Choctaw people — give many gumbo recipes a distinctive spice. Some cooks thicken their soup with a cooked flour paste called roux, while others swear by sautéed slices of okra.\nEvery possible version is on display each year at the World Champion Gumbo Cookoff in New Iberia, Louisiana, where cooks battle for some serious soup-master bragging rights.\nRelated article\nAmerican food: The 20 greatest dishes\nWhen the sun sets during the month of Ramadan, many Moroccans break their fasts with a hot bowl of this comforting chickpea stew. Cinnamon, ginger, turmeric and pepper lend warming spice to the savory tomato broth, which soaks into tender chickpeas. It’s also widely enjoyed in Algeria.\nWhile vegetarian recipes are popular, the most classic version is simmered with tender chunks of lamb or other meat. It’s not just fasting fare for Muslims; some North African Jews also prepare harira to break the annual fast of Yom Kippur.\nTart plum sauce called tkemali adds bright, zesty flavor to this traditional soup, which is one of Georgia’s most beloved dishes.\nIt’s made with unripe plums, whose sour note balances the richness of fatty beef and ground walnuts cooked into the soup. The aromatic kick, though, comes from the spice mix khmeli suneli, a blend of coriander, savory, fenugreek, black pepper, marigold and more.\nShaping — or pulling — la mian noodles by hand for this traditional soup is an art in itself. Artisans use a finely milled, high-gluten flour and alkaline powder to mix a stretchy dough, then pull and fold a single piece of dough to make enough noodles for a bowl of soup.\nSlip them into a bowl of beef broth for a world-class soup that includes tender beef, pale slices of radish, chili oil and fresh herbs. (At some shops, diners may even ask for noodles of a preferred thickness and shape.)\nSoup is what’s for breakfast in much of Myanmar, where sidewalk vendors and tea shops hawk steaming bowls of mohinga out of enormous vats. The soul of this noodle soup is the aromatic broth, which is simmered with herbs and thickened with toasted rice powder.\nFish lends added richness, while the thin rice noodles are perfect for slurping. Mohinga is so beloved that it’s gone from breakfast dish to anytime snack, and each region has its own twist on the classic soup.\nTripe simmered for hours in a piquant, garlicky broth is the ultimate Mexican hangover cure, but menudo goes far beyond morning-after remedies. It’s a favorite at weddings and big occasions, too, when an enormous pot of the traditional soup can feed dozens of guests.\nIt’s sheer comfort food, with kernels of hominy that get fresh bite from a garnish of raw onions, chiles and cilantro. Choose from one of two main varieties: Menudo rojo turns a deep red from chiles in the broth, while Sonoran-style Menudo blanco is a milder alternative.\nPalm oil and tomatoes tint coconut broth a warm, orangey red in this specialty from the Bahia region of Brazil, where locals eat steaming bowls on even the hottest days.\nThis soup’s real draw is sweet, tender shrimp floating in the broth, however. Traditionally, moqueca de camarão is cooked in a handmade pot made from black clay and the sap of mangrove trees, then brought to the table in the same authentic vessel.\nChicken noodle soup may reach its culinary pinnacle in this piquant Indonesian dish. Spices such as fresh turmeric, star anise, cinnamon, lemongrass and lime leaves combine for deeply layered aroma and flavor, with the jammy yolks of soft-boiled eggs to add extra richness.\nEvery part of Indonesia has a local twist, and the soup is also beloved in Singapore, Malaysia and in faraway Suriname in South America, where the recipe arrived with Javanese immigrants.\nEat topped with fried shallots, fresh limes and a fiery scattering of sliced red chiles.\nSweet, sour, spicy and salty, this soup’s magnificent broth is the ideal foil for sweet, tender shrimp. Aromatic ingredients include galangal, lemongrass and lime leaves, while slivers of bright red bird’s eye chilis add additional heat.\nTom yum goong is just one of many varieties of tom yum soup in Thailand — this version comes enriched with fat prawns, and is a favorite with many diners.\nLong-simmered pork bones impart intense flavor to this classic ramen, whose broth is cloudy with marrow and fat. It’s a signature of Fukuoka Prefecture on the southerly island of Kyushu, but the rich soup is now served in ramen shops across the country (and world).\nWhile the indulgent broth is the star of tonkotsu ramen, a bowl isn’t complete without slices of pork belly and a tangle of noodles that are hard in the center. Eat with a pair of chopsticks and a flat-bottomed spoon, and don’t forget to slurp — it’s believed to enhance the flavor.\nBoiled rice or barley adds grainy sweetness to this creamy yogurt soup. It’s believed to ward off colds during winter; some Turkish hospitals even serve yogurt soup to recovering patients.\nA crumble of dried mint helps balance the yogurt’s slight tang. Serve with a pillowy round of fresh pita bread.\nJen Rose Smith is a writer based in Vermont. Find her work at jenrosesmith.com, or follow her on Twitter @jenrosesmithvt.\n",

    "content": "Current allegations against former Congressman Matt Gaetz, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for U.S. attorney general, are likely only \"the tip of the iceberg,\" according to a lawyer representing two women who testified that Gaetz paid them for sex.\nGaetz, formerly the subject of a House Ethics Committee investigation and federal criminal probe into allegations including sexual misconduct, was nominated by Trump to become the nation's legal authority on November 13, with the president-elect at the time praising him as a \"deeply gifted and tenacious attorney\" who would \"root out systemic corruption\" in government.\nA report on the House probe was effectively blocked from release by Gaetz resigning just after being nominated by Trump. A firestorm of controversy has since erupted over demands that the report be released ahead of Gaetz's Senate confirmation hearings, with some Republicans calling for the report to be made public.\nThe report is likely to contain testimony from two women represented by Florida attorney Joel Leppard. The women, who also testified as part of the federal investigation, allege that Gaetz paid them for sex at \"sex parties\" that the Republican attended in 2017 and 2018. One of the women also claims that she witnessed Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old girl. Gaetz has denied all wrongdoing.\nDuring a CNN appearance on Tuesday night, Leppard suggested that testimony from his clients is \"just a fraction\" of evidence likely to be in the ethics report, arguing that evidence to support ethical violations by Gaetz is likely to be \"overwhelming.\"\n\"You have to understand my clients are only two out of the over a dozen witnesses that testified,\" Leppard told CNN's Erin Burnett. \"I was present for two of those. So, what I'm telling you is just a fraction of evidence that's available, of the thousands of documents and the 25 subpoenas, 12 witnesses.\"\n\"It's probably the tip of the iceberg,\" he added. \"The evidence that the House has, I would presume, is overwhelming because my clients were just two of the witnesses. And there are very important witnesses who have yet to come out and give a preview of what the House Ethics Committee results might show.\"\nNewsweek reached out for comment to the offices of Trump and Gaetz via email on Tuesday night.\nThe House committee is set to meet for a discussion on the potential release of the report, which was previously made available for review by all committee members, on Wednesday.\nEvidence purportedly included in the report, including sworn testimony from a woman who alleges to have had sex with Gaetz while she was a minor, were reportedly downloaded in a hacking incident on Monday, although the materials remain publicly unreleased.\nTrump has reportedly been calling reluctant Republican senators in an attempt to convince them to back Gaetz. When asked whether he was \"reconsidering\" Gaetz's nomination on Tuesday, the president-elect replied, \"no.\"\nUpdate 11/19/24, 9:38 p.m.: This article has been updated with further information and context.\n",

    "content": "A top United States Navy admiral has warned of the American weapons stockpile being depleted by continuing to send weapons to Europe and the Middle East.\nPresident Joe Biden's administration has been steadily supplying Ukraine and Israel with billions of dollars of weapons from the U.S. conflicts to aid in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nAdmiral Samuel Paparo, who leads the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, said at an event on Tuesday that it would be \"dishonest\" to claim that the shipments were not utilizing weapons that could be used elsewhere.\nPaparo expressed concerns that American forces in the Pacific could be impacted due to weapons like Patriot missiles being shipped overseas, pointing in particular to regional threats posed by China.\n\"With some of the Patriots that have been employed, some of the air-to-air missiles that have been employed, it's now eating into stocks, and to say otherwise would be dishonest,\" Paparo said, according to Reuters.\n\"Inherently, it imposes costs on the readiness of America to respond in the Indo-Pacific region, which is the most stressing theater for the quantity and quality of munitions, because the PRC [People's Republican of China] is the most capable potential adversary in the world,\" he added.\nNewsweek reached out to the Department of Defense and the White House via email for comment on Tuesday evening.\nPaparo's remarks come about two months before control of the White House and the federal government changes hands with the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump.\nTrump and many of his allies have expressed concerns about threats from China while being notably less willing than Biden to continue providing military aid to Ukraine. However, the president-elect has made it clear that he intends to keep supplying Israel.\nEarlier on Tuesday, the Associated Press reported that the Biden administration would be sending an additional $275 million in weapons to Ukraine just days after the current president authorized Kyiv to use U.S.-supplied long-range missiles for strikes inside Russia.\nUkraine reportedly launched eight Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles into Russia on Tuesday, with only two intercepted. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov suggested that Russia could retaliate with nuclear weapons if it feels that its \"sovereignty and territorial integrity\" is threatened. However, similar warnings have come and gone throughout the war.\nThe new aid package, authorized under presidential drawdown authority, reportedly includes air defenses like High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), 155mm and 105mm artillery rounds, Javelin anti-armor missiles and a range of additional equipment and spare parts.\nBefore Trump's inauguration, the Biden administration faces a tight deadline to expedite $7.1 billion in weapons from Pentagon stockpiles. The administration is also working to disburse its share of a $50 billion loan to Ukraine, funded by frozen Russian assets, according to the AP.\n",

    "content": "Ben & Jerry’s said in a lawsuit filed Wednesday that parent company Unilever has silenced its attempts to express support for Palestinian refugees and threatened to dismantle its board and sue its members over the issue.\nThe lawsuit is the latest sign of the long-simmering tensions between Ben & Jerry’s and consumer products maker Unilever. A rift erupted between the two in 2021 after Ben & Jerry’s said it would stop selling its products in the Israeli-occupied West Bank because it was inconsistent with its values, a move that led some investors to divest Unilever shares.\nThe ice cream maker then sued Unilever for selling its business in Israel to its licensee there, which allowed marketing in the West Bank and Israel to continue. That lawsuit was settled in 2022.\nIn its new lawsuit, Ben & Jerry’s says that Unilever has breached the terms of the 2022 settlement, which has remained confidential. As part of the agreement, however, Unilever is required to “respect and acknowledge the Ben & Jerry’s independent board’s primary responsibility over Ben & Jerry’s social mission,” according to the lawsuit.\n“Ben & Jerry’s has on four occasions attempted to publicly speak out in support of peace and human rights,” according to the lawsuit. “Unilever has silenced each of these efforts.”\nIn response, Unilever said in an emailed statement: “Our heart goes out to all victims of the tragic events in the Middle East. We reject the claims made by B&J’s social mission board, and we will defend our case very strongly.”\n“We would not comment further on this legal matter,” it added.\nBen & Jerry’s said in the lawsuit it has tried to call for a ceasefire, support the safe passage of Palestinian refugees to Britain, back students protesting at U.S. colleges against civilian deaths in Gaza, and advocate for a halt in U.S. military aid to Israel, but has been blocked by Unilever.\nThe independent board separately spoke out on some of those topics, but the company was muzzled, the lawsuit says.\nBen & Jerry’s said that Peter ter Kulve, Unilever’s head of ice cream, said he was concerned about the “continued perception of anti-Semitism” regarding the ice cream brand voicing its opinions on Gazan refugees, according to the lawsuit.\nUnilever was also required under the settlement agreement to make a total of $5 million in payments to Ben & Jerry’s for the brand to make donations to human rights groups of its choosing, according to the lawsuit.\nBen & Jerry’s selected the left-leaning Jewish Voice for Peace and the San Francisco Bay Area Chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, among others, the filing says.\nUnilever in August objected to the selections, saying that Jewish Voice for Peace was “too critical of the Israeli government,” according to the lawsuit.\nBen & Jerry’s has positioned itself as socially conscious since Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield founded the company in a renovated gas station in 1978. It kept that mission after Unilever acquired it in 2000.\nIn March, Unilever said it will spin off its ice cream business, which includes Ben & Jerry’s, by the end of 2025 to simplify its holdings.\nUnilever’s dozens of products include Dove soap, Hellmann’s mayonnaise, Knorr bouillon cubes, Surf detergent and Vaseline petroleum jelly.\n",

    "content": "By some estimates, almost half of US private sector workers — close to 57 million people, according to AARP — do not have access to a retirement plan at their jobs. That’s either because their company doesn’t offer one or because they don’t qualify to participate in an employer’s existing plan.\nThat is just one reason why policy experts see a retirement savings crisis on tap for so many Americans over the next several decades.\nBut the advent of state-sponsored auto IRAs — individual retirement account programs that workers can be automatically enrolled in if their companies don’t have their own workplace plan in place — is helping to make a dent in that coverage gap.\nAuto IRAs are relatively new. The first one started in 2017, and now a total of 17 states have enacted their own, although only 10 are currently in effect, with a few others scheduled to come on line next year, per AARP.\nBut, just based on data from eight states’ programs, more than 900,000 workers have already amassed savings of over $1.7 billion as of October, according to the Georgetown Center for Retirement Initiatives.\nAnd two new auto IRA analyses released this week — by the Pew Retirement Savings Project and by Gusto, a payroll and HR software provider for small and medium-sized businesses — found broad-based benefits, especially for low-to-middle-income earners, who are typically least likely to have access to workplace plans.\nThe 17 states that have enacted auto IRAs to date are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.\nRelated article\nGen Xers are nearing retirement. Here’s why many are more at risk of running short of money than younger colleagues\nWhile they each have their own rules, they typically require employers to make a choice: Either offer their workforce access to the auto IRA or set up their own employer-sponsored plan, like a 401(k).\nEmployers that opt to use the state’s auto IRA automatically enroll employees and withhold a pre-set savings rate — usually 5% — of a worker’s pay every pay period, according to John Scott, director of Pew’s Retirement Savings Project. Workers have the option to change the payroll contribution amount or opt out of the plan altogether.\nAuto IRAs are structured as Roth IRAs, according to Georgetown CRI — so savings contributions are made with after-tax dollars and the savings can grow and be withdrawn in retirement tax free.\nEmployers are not allowed to make matching contributions to auto IRAs, but some participating workers may benefit from the federal saver’s tax credit or a new federal savers’ match coming into effect in 2027, Scott noted.\nNoting that less than a third of workers in the bottom half of the income distribution own a retirement account, Gusto found that “workers in states with auto-enrollment IRA policies are 20% more likely to save for retirement.”\nIt also found that auto-enrollment IRAs had effectively boosted the savings rate of low-to-middle income earners by 55%.\n“The average worker making the median income or less increased their retirement savings rate from 2.2% to 3.4% following implementation of an auto-IRA program. This results in an increase in retirement income of $150 per month,” Gusto’s researchers wrote.\nRelated article\nTraditional pension plans are pretty rare. But here’s who still has them and how they work\nInitial data also suggests that the introduction of auto IRAs might correlate with more employers offering their own plans.\nPew found that in some states with auto IRAs more private sector plans have been introduced. “There is usually an increase in new plan formation when the state programs start or at major implementation deadline dates, as was the case with California in 2022,” researchers wrote.\nIt’s not entirely clear why, since smaller businesses often cite cost and administrative burden as reasons why they don’t sponsor a retirement plan.\nBut, Pew noted in its report, “The post-pandemic improvement in the economy may be helping as well as new incentives for employers from the 2019 passage of the SECURE 1.0 legislation, which made it easier and less expensive for small business owners to set up retirement plans for their employees.”\nIt’s possible that, when pressed by their state to either offer the auto IRA or do their own plan, some businesses may have been spurred into action if they’d already been thinking about offering a 401(k) or other employer-sponsored optio﻿n, Scott suggested.\nAnd that’s good both for the employer and the employees. A robust workplace savings plan can help attract and retain workers. And employer plans offer workers tax breaks and direct matching contributions, which can help them grow their nest eggs faster than they otherwise might.\n",

    "content": "Two women who claim they were paid for sex by former Rep. Matt Gaetz provided House ethics investigators with “numerous” photos related to time they spent with the Florida Republican, a lawyer for the women said Tuesday, including from an alleged 2019 trip to New York.\nThe women said they were paid by the former congressman for sex on that trip, during which they also joined Gaetz at a Fox News studio while he filmed a TV appearance, their attorney Joel Leppard told CNN’s Erin Burnett on “OutFront.” Gaetz allegedly covered the women’s travel costs as well, Leppard said.\nThe women additionally provided the House Ethics Committee with selfies Gaetz is said to have sent them, according to their lawyer. They also testified that they sent nude photos to Gaetz, sometimes at his request, Leppard said.\nGaetz was recently tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to serve as his attorney general and resigned from Congress last week, effectively ending the ethics probe into him. The panel had investigated allegations of misconduct against Gaetz, including “sexual misconduct and illicit drug use,” and is considering whether to release a report on its findings.\nAsked by the committee whether they ever felt pressured by Gaetz, Leppard said one of his clients testified that she felt the need to “please” the then-congressman before attending an electronic music show during the New York visit.\nCNN has reached out to Gaetz for comment. Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.\nLeppard’s account of the testimony provides more insight into the evidence the House committee collected in its probe, which was conducted in addition to a criminal investigation by the Justice Department. Federal prosecutors declined to charge Gaetz – a decision the former congressman has pointed to as he has vehemently denied the accusations, which also include the claim that he had sex with a then-underage woman who went on to testify in both investigations.\n“Merrick Garland’s DOJ cleared Matt Gaetz and didn’t charge him,” a spokesperson for Gaetz told CNN last week.\nAs the Senate prepares to formally consider Gaetz for the attorney general role, Democrats and some Republicans are calling for access to the House panel’s report. After Gaetz abruptly resigned from Congress upon Trump’s selection announcement, the committee delayed plans to meet to discuss the report’s release and is next scheduled to meet Wednesday. House Mike Speaker Johnson, who in the past has said he will stay out of the ethics committee’s business, has expressed opposition to the release of the report.\nLeppard noted the House panel heard testimony from several other witnesses.\n“The evidence that the House has, I would presume, is overwhelming, because my clients were just two of the other witnesses, and there are very important witnesses who have yet to come out and give a preview of what the House Ethics Committee results might show,” he said.\nHouse investigators, according to the lawyer, asked the two women about records they had obtained showing payments, largely transmitted electronically, allegedly made to them by Gaetz. Leppard said the records showed one of his clients was paid more than $6,000 by the congressman and the other more than $4,000.\n“What I’m telling you is just a fraction of the evidence that’s available, of the thousands of documents” the House obtained, Leppard said.\nCNN’s Annie Grayer contributed to this report.\n",

    "content": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.\nJimmy Lai, the pugnacious Hong Kong media tycoon whose now shuttered tabloid Apple Daily was a regular thorn in Beijing’s side, took the stand Wednesday in his own defense for the first time in a high stakes national security trial that could send him to prison for life.\nThe 77 year-old, known for his decades-long support of the city’s pro-democracy movement and outspoken criticism of China’s leaders, hasn’t been heard from since he was arrested nearly four years ago amid a deepening crackdown on dissent.\nDressed in a green cardigan and a brown blazer, a visibly thinner Lai smiled and waved at a public gallery packed with supporters, as he entered the courtroom flanked by officers. His wife and daughter were seated next to Cardinal Joseph Zen, an outspoken former bishop of Hong Kong and a friend of Lai’s.\nHe faces two counts of colluding with foreign forces, a crime under a sweeping national security law introduced in 2020 that has transformed Hong Kong, as well as a separate sedition charge. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges and faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted.\nIn his defense, Lai stressed that he had always opposed violence during the anti-government protests of 2019 and called the idea of advocating for Hong Kong and Taiwan independence as “crazy.” Both issues are deemed anathema by Beijing and seen as “red lines.”\nThe tycoon called allegations of him lobbying for independence a “conspiracy” to trap him, adding that “I never allow any of our staff or our newspaper to mention … this.” He said he never hired anyone at Apple Daily who advocated the idea.\nIn US court rooms, defense lawyers often advise their clients against testifying in court. But in Hong Kong, court testimony offers a rare chance for detained democracy figures to have their voices heard in a system where national security charges have resulted in months and years of pre-trial detention as well as restrictions on speaking out.\nOn Tuesday, more than 40 of Hong Kong’s best known pro-democracy figures were sentenced to prison terms of up to 10 years on subversion charges at a separate national security trial. Among them was Joshua Wong, a former student leader and poster child of the city’s once thriving pro-democracy movement, who shouted “I love Hong Kong” before he left the dock.\nLai’s testimony comes just weeks after Donald Trump, who has previously vowed to free the media tycoon, won the White House and has announced a proposed cabinet stacked with multiple China hawks.\nLai said on the stand he had never spoken with Trump, though he knew two people who had unofficial access to the first Trump administration. “I don’t think he knew me. I think his aides knew me and briefed him about me,” said the former businessman.\nIn later testimony Lai subsequently named the two people as Jack Keane, a retired US army general, and former deputy defense secretary Paul Wolfowitz.\nBritain has also called for the release of Lai, who has a British passport. On Monday, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer raised the issue with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Brazil. “We’re concerned by reports of Jimmy Lai’s deterioration,” Starmer told Xi in their first meeting.\nLai has been in jail since December 2020 awaiting trial on multiple charges linked to his support for Hong Kong’s democracy protest movement through his media business. He was the founder of Apple Daily, a pro-democracy, anti-Beijing newspaper that was forced to shut down in 2021.\nThe trial, which began in December 2023, is the most high-profile prosecution of a Hong Kong media figure since the city was handed over from British to Chinese control in 1997. It is resuming following a lengthy pause after Lai’s attorneys’ unsuccessful attempt to have the charges dismissed.\nAround 100 people waited in line under cold rain on Wednesday morning ahead of the trial testimony, with some expressing support for the media tycoon.\nChiu Mei-ying, a woman in her 70s, said she got to court at 4am this morning. “Lai represents the spirit of Hong Kong,” she told CNN. “After the closure of Apple Daily, there is no real news (to read).”\nOn Wednesday, Lai began his defense by laying out what he called the core values of Apple Daily, which he said included the rule of law and the pursuit of democracy and personal freedoms.\nHe also recounted how he built his media empire in the aftermath of Beijing’s bloody crackdown on the pro-democracy Tiananman Square protests in 1989.\nAs a businessman who had made “a bit of money,” he wanted to be involved in distributing information to the public, he said. “The more information you have, the more you are in the know, the more you’re free,” he told the court.\nProsecutors allege that articles published by Apple Daily violated Hong Kong’s national security law by calling for overseas sanctions against the city’s leaders following the imposition of the national security law in 2020.\nChinese and Hong Kong officials say the law, enacted in the wake of anti-government protests in 2019, has “restored stability” and closed loopholes that allowed “foreign forces” to undermine China.\nBut critics say it has decimated Hong Kong’s freedoms and altered the city’s legal landscape.\nLike all national security trials in Hong Kong, Lai’s trial does not have a jury and is presided over by three judges picked from a national security committee that is approved by Hong Kong’s leader.\nLai, a businessman who made a fortune selling clothing before becoming a publisher, has long been an unapologetic thorn in Beijing’s side, openly using Apple Daily as a vehicle to criticize Chinese leaders since its founding in 1995.\nA devout Catholic and a known vocal supporter of Trump, Lai had lobbied extensively overseas for foreign governments to apply pressure on China over Hong Kong, something that infuriated leaders in Beijing. At the height of the protests in 2019, Lai traveled to Washington, where he met with then Vice President Mike Pence and other US politicians to discuss the political situation in Hong Kong.\nOn Wednesday, Lai said on the stand he had told Pence to “voice out in support of Hong Kong,” without asking for specific actions. “I would not dare to ask the vice-president to do anything,” he said.\nLai had long held a conviction that Trump and the US government should not shy away from supporting Hong Kong’s civil liberties, which are key for the city’s status as a conduit between China and international markets.\n“Mr President, you’re the only one who can save us,” Lai said in an interview with CNN in 2020 weeks before he was arrested. “If you save us, you can stop China’s aggressions. You can also save the world.”\nProsecutors have argued that Lai’s actions and his newspaper’s publishing amounted to lobbying for sanctions against Beijing and Hong Kong, something that is prohibited by the national security law. His lawyers have countered that Lai stopped doing so after the national security law came into effect on June 30, 2020.\nDuring Trump’s first term as president, the US government ended Hong Kong’s special trade status and signed into law an act that authorized sanctions on the city’s officials over China’s crackdown in Hong Kong.\nHong Kong’s current leader, John Lee, the city’s security chief during the landmark 2019 protests, is among those on the US sanctions list, which also includes the city’s former leader and current chief justice.\nAt a news conference earlier this month, Lee did not directly answer questions about how he would deal with Trump’s return to the presidency. He said there should be “respect for the non-interference with local affairs, internal affairs” of the city, and said Hong Kong values the rule of law.\n“We desire mutual respect with all countries, including the US, because trade is beneficial for both sides,” Lee said.\nLast month, conservative podcast host Hugh Hewitt asked Trump whether he can speak with Xi and free Lai, if he is re-elected.\nTrump replied “100%, I’ll get him out” and said that it would be “so easy” to free the detained media tycoon, without providing further details.\nBut Chinese and Hong Kong leaders have long bristled at any criticism leveled by Western governments at the national security crackdown in Hong Kong and have repeatedly condemned Lai in statements issued both before and throughout his trial.\n“Jimmy Lai is the main planner and participant of the anti-China chaos in Hong Kong, and is an agent and pawn of the anti-China forces,” a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday.\n",

    "content": "The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv has closed, following \"specific\" information of a potential air attack.\nThe Embassy said that it was exercising an \"abundance\" of caution in its move to close on Wednesday.\nThe closure comes after it was announced on Sunday that President Joe Biden will authorize Ukraine to use U.S.-provided weapons in order to launch strikes against Russian territory.\nUkraine had been urging the U.S. to provide this authorization for months, but the White House had resisted doing so due to fears of escalation. However, following Moscow's decision to deploy North Korean soldiers to the Ukrainian front, the administration reportedly changed their thinking.\nIn a statement, the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine shared a message to U.S. citizens in the country on its website.\nIt said: \"The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv has received specific information of a potential significant air attack on November 20. Out of an abundance of caution, the Embassy will be closed, and Embassy employees are being instructed to shelter in place.\n\"The U.S. Embassy recommends U.S. citizens be prepared to immediately shelter in the event an air alert is announced.\"\nThe embassy advised that citizens monitor the local media for updates, identify shelter locations in advance of an air alert, immediately take shelter if an air alert is announced and follow the directions of Ukrainian officials and first responders in the event of an emergency.\nNewsweek has reached out to the U.S. embassy in Ukraine via email for comment.\nThe message is unusual in its specificity, as Russian air attacks on Ukraine have become an almost daily occurrence since Russia launched its full-scale offensive into the country in February 2022.\nUkraine marked 1,000 days of the conflict on Tuesday and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Kyiv issued a defiant statement, where it said: \"Ukraine will never submit to the occupiers, and the Russian military will be punished for violating international law.\"\nRussia has recently escalated its air attacks, according to the Associated Press. It has launched complex combined drone and missile barrages in order to target energy infrastructure, as temperatures start to drop.\nEarlier this week, a Russian strike on the northeastern Sumy region in Ukraine killed seven people including a child. Zelensky condemned the attack and said: \"Every new Russian strike only confirms Putin's true intentions. He wants the war to continue; he is not interested in talking about peace.\"\nFollowing the news of the U.S. approval of the long-range missiles, a revised version of Russia's nuclear doctrine, which had been approved by President Vladimir Putin circulated on Tuesday.\nThis version outlined the conditions under which Moscow could deploy the biggest nuclear arsenal in the world. It lowers the threshold for usage, and provides Putin with the ability to respond to a conventional strike backed by nuclear weapons. This may include Ukraine's recent U.S.-supplied ATACMS missile strike into Russian territory, which Moscow claims happened on Tuesday, when missiles struck the Bryansk area.\nDo you have a story we should be covering?

    "content": "All eyes should have been on the sky over a launchpad in Texas on Tuesday as the world’s largest rocket streaked thunderously toward space.\nBut the orbit currently getting the most attention is not in the heavens — it’s the increasingly intimate one back on Earth uniting the planet’s soon-to-be-again most powerful man and its richest man.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk — after trips to see Republicans in Washington and an Ultimate Fighting Championship match in New York, including a mid-flight McDonald’s with a grimacing Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — took to the road again to watch Musk’s SpaceX Starship rocket blast off on its latest test flight.\nFor once, Trump’s hyperbole wasn’t over the top. “I’m heading to the Great State of Texas to watch the launch of the largest object ever to be elevated, not only to Space, but simply by lifting off the ground,” he wrote on social media.\nMusk, the Tesla and SpaceX visionary, has spent the last two weeks basking in Trump’s reflected glory at Mar-a-Lago. He’s around so much it’s almost like he’s family, and he even made it into a photo of Trump’s extended clan. Now, it was time for him to share some of his own aura with his new best friend.\nTrump, jaw clenched, eyes narrowed against the glare and sporting a red MAGA hat bearing a “45” and a “47,” struck a Mount Rushmore pose, certainly aware of television split screens that would pair him alongside the rocket’s takeoff burn. He looked almost if he was claiming some of the credit for himself.\nIn the nervous moments before the launch, various lesser satellites revolved around Trump, including his son Donald Jr., Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Texas Rep. Ronny Jackson, the former White House physician. But the president-elect seemed most animated when Musk appeared and explained what would unfold when the rocket took off.\nIn the event, Trump didn’t get to see the ballistic ballet of SpaceX returning its massive booster to be clutched by a state-of-the-art launchpad that he raved about on the campaign trail. “I see that fire pouring out the bottom of the rocket that’s coming in sideways and I say, ‘it’s going to crash into the gantry,’” Trump said earlier this month. “And those two big beautiful arms they grab it — I said, ‘What the hell was that?’”\nOn Tuesday, mission controllers made a split-second decision instead to ditch the giant Roman candle-like vehicle in the Gulf of Mexico after its slow-motion descent. “Maybe they just want to be careful not to kill the president-elect of the United States by any chance,” Greg Autry, associate provost for space commercialization and strategy at the University of Central Florida, told CNN.\nBut the stunning spectacle of the Starship roaring off the launchpad and its flight around the globe in a matter of minutes to delicately splash down, feet first, in the Indian Ocean, was testimony to the genius of Musk, who revolutionized the space industry, revived the US-manned spaceflight program, and is on course to return humans to the moon — and eventually Mars.\nIt explains why Trump wants Musk alongside him. If he can disrupt the aerospace sector, at the same time as reinventing the electric vehicle business, what might Musk do with his new Department of Government Efficiency, which Trump has tapped him and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead? Trump believes he has a mandate to blow up the federal bureaucracy like one of the prototype rockets his new friend used to supercharge progress in his space program.\nBut the president-elect’s presence at the Starship launch and his anointing of Musk with his approval also point to the huge problem with their tie-up.\nThe South African-born billionaire now has a massive role in space exploration, US national security and the electric vehicle industry. And Trump can grant Musk extraordinary favors. Musk, armed with the authority of the president in his new role as scourge of government, may even be able to wipe out regulations that hinder his business and profit from tilting the marketplace.\nConflicts of interest weren’t exactly taken seriously in the first Trump administration. But Musk’s ubiquity in Trump 2.0 as the standout ally in an emerging inner circle of billionaires, millionaires and Fox News anchors means they have officially become a joke.\nIt’s not rocket science why Trump likes Musk. He’s dynamic and a certifiable genius. The president-elect also likes the ego boost of being courted by the world’s wealthiest human — especially one who spent millions of dollars to get him elected and turned X into a free-for-all that mirrors Trump’s conspiratorial worldview and has immense power to influence vast numbers of voters.\nIn many ways, Musk is a far more successful version of Trump himself. He tears things down before building them back up, had multiple marriages and was shaped by a domineering father who left a mark on his psyche. It’s not often that Trump, who seeks to dominate every room and relationship, seems impressed about something other than himself. But his fan boy appreciation for Musk’s rocketry seems perfectly genuine.\nStill, it’s about more than money and space dreams.\nBy palling around with Musk, the 78-year-old Trump secured an entry into a young, male subculture where the Tesla pioneer is seen as an icon. Their friendship also bought Trump credibility among other opinion formers that reach this demographic, which was evident in his appearances on YouTube shows and podcasts with Joe Rogan, the Nelk Boys, Theo Von and Barstool Sports.\nAll of this helped improve Trump’s standing in the election with young, male voters — a constituency that Democrats are struggling to reach. Trump has rarely seemed as at ease or authentic as he does in these venues, talking with authority about wrestling, football and conspiracy theories. One of the most remarkable moments came on Von’s show when Trump became unusually animated in asking his host about his past cocaine use.\nTrump’s visit to Musk’s launchpad was also the latest occasion since the election when he has inserted himself into high-profile photo-ops. The image reflects the developing reality that Trump, who’s always been an icon in the UFC and reality TV worlds, is indisputably becoming a cultural figure as well as a political one.\nThe UFC’s smash mouth image explains a lot of Trump’s political style. And now a Trump dance is going viral.\nHis political opponents saw his strange jiggling on stage at his rallies as a sign of fraying cognitive health. His supporters perceived humor and self-deprecation. Now the president-elect’s two-fisted shimmy is being adopted by athletes in major league sports, who boogie Trump-style to celebrate big-fight wins, touchdowns and goals. This is heady stuff for a Republican Party that has for years struggled to match Democrats when it comes to big-time celebrity support.\nBut something more sinister is also at play. Trump is sanding down the roughest edges of an extreme image that was cemented by the darkest closing argument of any presidential candidate in modern history.\nThe president-elect, who dances on state to the Village People’s “Y.M.C.A.,” is the same one who promises mass deportations of undocumented migrants, who tried to steal the 2020 election after lying about the result, who is a convicted felon, and who appears set on wielding uncheckable power after January 20. It’s long been a tactic of authoritarians to soften their images with antics and stunts that further their personality cults and disguise their more nefarious goals. Perhaps it’s a coincidence, but North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, at moments when he wants to be seen as the father of the nation, often attends televised rocket launches.\nAs well as “Y.M.C.A.,” another one of the MAGA campaign trail soundtrack staples is “Rocket Man” by Elton John, which is about an astronaut “burning out his fuse” Trump-style as he flies alone through space. The hit perhaps reflects Trump’s starry-eyed infatuation with Musk’s amazing array of spaceships and limitless ambition.\nBut despite their budding friendship, it’s becoming fashionable to speculate when the big Trump-Musk bromance might itself blow up — given that both men are abrasive, need to be the stars in their own firmaments and appear to find close friendships difficult.\nWith Musk, Trump might get more than he bargained for.\nHe may not, for instance, be willing pay the political price of mass layoffs among federal workers, loss of productivity and the failure of government programs that Musk might cause with savage cuts recommended by the new DOGE.\nAnd Trump’s recent quips that he can’t get rid of Musk from Mar-a-Lago have been interpreted by some as a sign that his welcome is wearing thin.\n“You can only ultimately have one star of the show and that star of the show is going to be Donald Trump,” former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Tuesday. But he also argued that Musk is brilliant, innovative and inventive and was fully on brand for the president-elect. “Trump campaigned on the notion that we are going to break the mold,” he said.\nWhen Trump is inaugurated for a second time as president of the United States, there will be no mistaking who is the senior partner — even if Musk wields vast non-state power through his wealth and business ventures that penetrate deep into the economies of nations all over the world.\nMusk is also becoming a force multiplier for Trump — another reason to keep him around. The president-elect put him on a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky after the election. (Musk controls the Starlink internet service that is vital to Ukraine’s military in the war with Russia that Trump has pledged to end). And French President Emmanuel Macron, an astute student of the art of Trump flattery, plans to invite the 47th president and Musk to an AI summit in Paris in February.\nTrump spent the early months of his first term taunting North Korean leader Kim as “little rocket man” for his proclivity to shoot off missiles every time he believed his pariah state wasn’t getting attention.\nThe hostility soon wore off and Trump has often talked about how they “fell in love” — although their photo-op summits did little to reverse Pyongyang’s ballistic missile and nuclear programs. It’s too early to say whether the Kim and Trump bromance will resume in the next president’s second term.\nAnd in any case, Trump has got a new rocket man.\n",

Among them is a sandstone sculpture of a celestial dancer that was smuggled from central India to London, before being illegally sold to one of the Met’s patrons and donated to the museum.\nThe repatriations resulted from “several ongoing investigations” into looting networks, including those operated by convicted art traffickers Nancy Wiener and Subhash Kapoor, an American antiquities dealer who was sentenced to 10 years in jail for running a multimillion-dollar looting network through his New York gallery, the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office said in press release.\nKapoor was sent to face charges in India’s Tamil Nadu state following his arrest in Germany in 2011. The DA’s office obtained an arrest warrant for him in 2012though he remains in custody in India, pending his extradition to the US.\nRelated article\nCambodia welcomes the Met’s repatriation of centuries-old statues looted during past turmoil\n“Today’s repatriation marks another victory in what has been a multiyear international investigation into antiquities trafficked by one of history’s most prolific offenders,” William Walker, the federal Homeland Security Investigation’s New York special agent in charge, said in a press statement.\nThe items were formally returned at a ceremony at the Indian consulate in New York Wednesday.\nSince its creation over a decade ago, the Manhattan District Attorney’s Antiquities Trafficking Unit –– a task force of lawyers, investigators and art experts –– has recovered 5,800 antiquities valued at almost $460 million. The unit has also convicted 16 people of trafficking offenses and filed for the extradition of six others linked to stolen cultural property.\nIn July, the US and India signed an agreement to protect cultural property by preventing illegal trades and streamlining the process of returning stolen antiquities back to India.\n",

    "content": "Visitors to New York City’s famed Flatiron Building may have noticed the landmark’s lesser-known neighbor — a narrow high-rise that would be modest if not for its extravagant gold dome.\nNow, the 5,777-square-foot penthouse that occupies the shimmering dome (and the two-story octagonal cupola it crowns) is on sale for $25 million.\nThe five-bedroom, five-bathroom property sits atop 170 Fifth Avenue, which was built in 1898 and predates the Flatiron Building by four years.  Also known as the Sohmer Piano Building, it originally housed the manufacturing company that successfully brought the first baby grand pianos to market in the 1880s.\n“It’s really buying a true old New York piece of property,” said the Sotheby’s listing agent, Lawrence Treglia, in a phone call to CNN. “The cupola is iconic. Whenever you see the Flatiron building (in photographs), it’s always shown on the right-hand side.”\n“There’s nothing of this kind in that price bracket,” Treglia added, noting that comparable New York penthouses are typically in new developments.\nThe Beaux-Arts building was designed by Robert Maynicke, who had a large architectural footprint in the city in the early 20th century — from the landmarked 41 Park Row, which originally housed The New York Times, to 200 Fifth Avenue, a one-time toy manufacturing hub with a distinctive gold sidewalk clock that now houses Eataly and the offices of Tiffany & Co., among others. (Maynicke was also responsible for 190 Bowery, the enigmatic graffitied corner building, formerly the longtime studio of photographer Jay Maisel that became the subject of local lore and a documentary).\nHaving once contained various businesses, including a publishing house, 170 Fifth Avenue was converted into a condominium at the turn of the millennium. The domed penthouse, formerly a loft, has only had one owner since: the philanthropist and entrepreneur Gregory C. Carr, who bought it in 2001 for around $7.5 million and subsequently renovated it, he told CNN over email. The proceeds of the current sale will be used to build schools and preschools in Mozambique, Carr added.\nRelated article\nAward-winning building to be demolished less than 30 years after being built\nThe property offers 360-degree views of the city from the cupola, which in the listing is staged as a sitting room with a bar cart. Other highlights include an open, eat-in kitchen with skylights; marbled bathrooms; a private roof deck; and a grand iron-wrought spiral staircase.\n“Being in that cupola is special,” Treglia said. “And being in the primary suite, you almost feel like you’re at the Plaza (Hotel), because of the design and how it’s situated.”\nAlthough 170 Fifth Avenue is not considered as much of an architectural marvel as its unusual triangular neighbor, it has a unique, slim design, too. The 13-floor building is only 29 feet wide (but 120 feet long), designed to replace a humble brownstone that stood on the site before it.\n",

Deliveries continued to decrease as European nations find alternative sources.\nEurope began working to diversify away from Russian gas supplies, giving rise to a reliance on Norwegian, Qatar and American gas starting the following year, according to Clean Energy Wire (CLEW), an independent, nonprofit platform that provides in-depth, analysis focused on the energy transition in Europe, particularly in Germany. Russia accounted for 40 percent of European gas prior to its invasion.\nUkraine has repeatedly pursued policy that would cut off Russian gas delivery as a means of continuing to deprive Moscow of profits that could help fund its continued war.\nRussia and Ukraine had an agreement to deliver gas through the war-torn nation over a five-year period that is set to expire at the end of 2024, and Kyiv has said it will not renew the deal.\nThe Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhgorod pipeline funneled gas from Siberia through the now Ukrainian-controlled Kursk region of Russia before passing through Ukraine to Slovakia. The pipeline still provides Ukraine with some income—roughly up to $1 billion in transit fees, compared to Russia's $3 billion on sales.\nWithout Austria, Russia only delivers significant gas volumes to Hungary and Slovakia, which they receive via pipelines in Turkey and Ukraine, respectively, according to Reuters.\nGazprom, however, continues to seek alternative delivery routes and cut-price rates to entice European countries to continue buying its gas, such as the Czech Republic did after almost completely ending its reliance in 2023.\nAzerbaijan has increasingly played a major role in helping Europe find alternative sources of oil as well as facilitate negotiations with Russia, due to the small Caucus nation's tight ties with Moscow.\n",

    "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\nFamously known for its extensive ring system, Saturn is one of four planets in our solar system that have the distinctive feature. And now, scientists hypothesize that Earth may have sported its own ring some 466 million years ago.\nDuring the Ordovician Period, a time of significant changes for Earth’s life-forms, plate tectonics and climate, the planet experienced a peak in meteorite strikes. Nearly two dozen impact craters known to occur during this time were all within 30 degrees of Earth’s equator, signaling that the meteoroids may have rained down from a rocky ring around the planet, according to a study published September 12 in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters.\n“It’s statistically unusual that you would get 21 craters all relatively close to the equator. It shouldn’t happen. They should be randomly distributed,” said lead author Andrew Tomkins, a geologist and professor of Earth and planetary sciences at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.\nNot only does the new hypothesis shed light on the origins of the spike in meteorite impacts, but it also may provide an answer to a previously unexplained event: A global deep freeze, one of the coldest climate events in Earth’s history, may have been a result of the ring’s shadow.\nScientists are hoping to find out more about the possible ring. It could help answer the mysteries of Earth’s history as well as pose new questions about the influence an ancient ring could have had on evolutionary development, Tomkins said.\nRelated article\nNew Uranus research suggests what’s known about the planet could be wrong\nWhen a smaller object gets close enough to a planet, it reaches what’s known as the Roche limit, the distance where the celestial body has enough gravitational pull to break apart the approaching body. The resulting debris then creates rings around the planet, such as those around Saturn that may have been formed by debris from icy moons, according to NASA.\nScientists previously believed that a large asteroid broke apart within the solar system, creating the meteorites that hit Earth during the Ordovician Period. However, such an impact would have likely caused the strikes to be more randomly distributed, such as the randomization of the craters on the moon, Tomkins said.\nThe study authors hypothesize that a large asteroid, estimated to be about 7.5 miles (12 kilometers) in diameter, instead reached Earth’s Roche limit, which might have been about 9,800 miles (15,800 kilometers) from the planet based on the measurements of past rubble-pile asteroids. The asteroid would have been largely beat up from other collisions, making rubble loose and easy to pull apart by Earth’s tidal force, Tomkins said.\nRelated article\nAlien-like signal from 2023 has been decoded. The next step is to figure out what it means\nThe ring would have formed along the equator due to Earth’s equatorial bulge, similar to how the rings of Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune are also around each of those planets’ equatorial planes, he added.\nAbout 200 impact strikes from throughout Earth’s history are known, Tomkins said. By looking at how Earth’s landmasses moved over time, the authors found that the 21 known craters dated to the Ordovician Period were all near the equator. Furthermore, only 30% of Earth’s land surface suitable for preserving a crater was near the equator. If the impacts were random instead of from a ring, most of the craters should have formed away from the equator, he added.\nThe authors also point to a February 2022 study that analyzed impact craters on Earth, the moon and Mars, and found signs for the Ordovician impact spike only on Earth, further adding evidence that aligns with the ring theory.\n“The paper presents a pleasing idea that ties together a few mysteries,” said astrophysicist Vincent Eke, an associate professor in the Institute for Computational Cosmology at the UK’s Durham University who was not involved with the new study.\nRelated article\nScientists have fiercely debated the existence of ‘Planet 9’ for a decade. Some say evidence is piling up\nThe research analysis found several deposits across Earth from the same period as the impact craters containing high levels of L chondrite, a common meteorite material, that had signs of shorter space radiation exposure than meteorites found today. The finding suggests that a large, space-weathered asteroid that likely strayed within Earth’s Roche limit broke up near the planet, the study authors wrote.\nA few million years following the period of increased meteor strikes, about 445 million years ago, there was a dramatic decrease in Earth’s global temperatures known as the Hirnantian Age.\n“The subsequent debris from such an event (a potential ring) could account for these three observations,” Eke said in an email, referring to the impact craters, meteorite debris and global climate shift.\nThe study authors are researching what extent of shade would be needed to cause a deep global freeze, a finding that in turn could help estimate how opaque the ring was, Tomkins said. Similarly, Earth could have been cooled by clouds of dust from the meteorite impacts, he added.\nRelated article\nAging spacecraft starts up a radio transmitter it hasn’t used since 1981 from 15 billion miles away\nTomkins said he hopes future research will establish how long the ring persisted and shed light on how it could have influenced the evolutionary changes that Earth faced most likely due to challenging climatic conditions. “Understanding the causes of Earth’s climate change can help us think about (the) evolution of life as well,” he added.\nIt’s difficult to say what such a ring would have looked like without knowing the density of the material, but Tomkins estimates that even a faint ring would have been visible from Earth.\n“If you were on the night side of the Earth looking up, and the sunlight is shining on the rings, but not on you, that would make it probably quite interestingly visible — it would be quite spectacular,” he said.\nBased on the duration of the global cooling period and the dating of the craters and meteorite material, Earth’s possible ring could have lasted 20 million to 40 million years, Tomkins said. Collisions between other particles would have caused space rocks to be thrown out of the ring.\nPrevious research found that ancient Mars might have also sported a ring, or rings, and scientists predict that planet may one day have more in the future.\n“While rings are associated with the outer, giant planets in the solar system at the present time, in the next 100 million years or so, Mars should acquire a ring system when its inner moon, Phobos, spirals inside the rigid Roche radius and is itself torn apart,” Eke said in an email. “Thankfully, for the development of life on Earth, these types of (events) are rare at the current time!”\nRelated article\nA space rock is about to become Earth’s new ‘mini-moon’\nSince late September, an asteroid named 2024 PT5 has been traveling near Earth. The space rock is commonly referred to as a “mini-moon” due to it coming within 2.8 million miles (4.5 million kilometers) of the planet. However, even during the asteroid’s closest pass to date on August 8 at about 352,300 miles (567,000 kilometers), it was nowhere near Earth’s Roche limit, said Carlos de la Fuente Marcos, a researcher on the faculty of mathematical sciences at the Complutense University of Madrid who has studied the mini-moon. De la Fuente Marcos was not involved in the new study.\nAlso, the suggested Earth ring would have “had to be the result of the disruption of a much larger body as the authors indicate in their paper,” he added in an email, so the asteroid, likely about 37 feet (11 meters) in diameter, could not have made a new ring for Earth.\n“You’d need to capture a big one and get it into exactly the right orbit to break up. … (This mini-moon) is just an example of the processes that go on in our near space area that can lead to the sort of thing we’re talking about,” Tomkins said. However, “this ring formation event we think may have happened only once in the last 500 million years.”\n",

    "content": "Texas Governor Greg Abbott is reportedly planning to expand the use of buoy barriers across the Rio Grande to deter migrants from unlawfully entering the U.S.\nThe decision would appear to come amid concerns of a surge in border crossings ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration.\nTrump, who won the popular vote for the first time in three attempts, made border security and immigration a core component of his decisive victory over Vice President Kamala Harris.\nThe former president has pledged to launch the largest mass deportation of undocumented migrants in American history when he returns to the White House.\nAccording to NewsNation, state crews have been surveying the area near Shelby Park along the river and plan to install barriers in high-traffic crossing zones as early as Wednesday.\nNewsweek emailed the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) and Governor Abbott's office outside of office hours for comment.\nDPS has been preparing for increased activity at the southern border, anticipating increased attempts to enter the U.S. ahead of Trump's return to the White House.\nDPS officers have been conducting \"mass migration response\" exercises along the border. One strategy involves positioning officers in their vehicles, with red and blue lights flashing, spaced every few hundred feet along the southern border.\nLieutenant Chris Olivarez, a spokesperson for the DPS-South Texas, said in a post on X, formerly Twitter: \"Displaying a show of force will effectively deter the potential for a mass migration event.\"\n\"You can expect to see an increase of the buoys in the Rio Grande River,\" Abbott told NewsNation in August.\nThe buoys were initially deployed in 2023 as part of Operation Lone Star, a program launched by Governor Abbott in 2021 to address irregular migration from Mexico into Texas.\nBuoy barriers are floating structures used to control or restrict movement across a body of water, such as a river, lake, or coastal area.\nAs part of Operation Lone Star, thousands of National Guard soldiers have been assigned to patrol the border, install razor wire fencing, and set up additional barriers to deter unauthorized crossings.\nOperation Lone Star, Abbott's $11 billion brainchild, spent $1 million for a 1,000-foot barrier on the Rio Grande near the Texas border town of Eagle Pass to discourage illegal border crossing.\nAbbott has been in a long-running standoff with President Joe Biden's administration over humanitarian concerns about border enforcement policies in Texas. He has expressed concern at what he views as inadequate federal action to address the surge in migrant crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border.\nIn June 2023, the Biden administration sued the state of Texas over the buoys, arguing that the state had failed to obtain a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to construct the barrier.\nIn July a federal appeals court ruled that floating barriers in the Rio Grande could remain but legal wrangling continues, with the Biden administration insisting that Texas' use of buoys has violated the federal Rivers and Harbors Act.\n",

Car and Driver reports that the Leaper, which has adorned its cars for several decades, is being eliminated in favor of the badge.\n“This is a reimagining that recaptures the essence of Jaguar, returning it to the values that once made it so loved, but making it relevant for a contemporary audience,” said Gerry McGovern, Jaguar Land Rover’s chief creative officer, in a press release.\nHe even joked a press event that Jaguar has “not been sniffing the white stuff — this is real,” according to Car Dealer Magazine.\nWhat all the new branding will look like on the cars will be unveiled at a Miami Art Week event on December 2.\n",

He was not involved in the research.\nThis study was particularly helpful in investigating sitting because of its large sample size and the methodology it employed, Diaz said.\nResearchers looked at data from nearly 90,000 people who wore an accelerometer for a week and compared their sedentary and active time with later diagnoses of conditions like stroke, heart attack and heart failure in later years, according to the study published Friday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.\nNot only was more sedentary time associated with greater risk for cardiovascular disease, but the data was able to show a general guideline for what might count as too much sitting, according to the study.\n“We would really recommend that as many people as possible avoid sitting more than 10.6 hours a day,” Ajufo said. “That’s not a hard and fast threshold, but we think it’s a reasonable first step for guidelines and public health intervention.”\nThere are some limitations when it comes to the data.\nThe data was part of the UK Biobank, a large biomedical database and research resource that follows people long-term. The sample was largely White and of European ancestry, which means that it doesn’t totally represent the US population, Ajufo said.\nRelated article\nDon’t sit on the toilet for more than 10 minutes at a time, doctors warn\nThe study is also observational, which means that while it can make associations, it can’t prove that the sitting was the cause of the heart disease, she added.\nIt makes sense that sitting too much of the day would take a toll, however, Diaz said.\nMuscles are very important for regulating blood sugar and fat levels in the blood, he added. To do their job well, muscles need movement.\n“Taking movement breaks is a way to give your muscles the stimulation they need to do their jobs, and it doesn’t take much,” Diaz said.\nIf you sit in an office all day and commute to and from work, those 10 and a half hours of sitting can add up quickly.\nThe answer may not be to get a standing desk, Diaz said.\nWhile standing is certainly not sitting, being still in one place like that doesn’t give your muscles the movement they need to efficiently break down sugars and lipids, he said.\nA bike or treadmill desk may help, he said. You can also try to see if small meetings can be had over a walk.\nRelated article\nStanding desks may be bad for your health, new research finds\nThe important thing is to add movement into your day in a way that makes sense for you and your schedule, Diaz added. He recommended getting up and walking for just a few minutes every half hour to hour or when you finish one task before moving to the next.\nUnfortunately, the data suggested a good workout at the end of the day won’t necessarily undo the problems caused by long bouts of sitting, Ajufo said.\n“Sometimes we think we can completely make up for some of the unhealthy behaviors we have … by going out and going for a run,” she said. “What we can say from the findings is that moderate to vigorous physical activity –– so that’s running, a brisk walk –– is not sufficient to neutralize the harmful effects of sitting.”\nBut don’t be disheartened about activity. Exercise is still always a good idea and benefits people in so many ways, Diaz said.\n“You’re still better off than the person who sat all day then didn’t exercise,” he said.\n",

    "content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks are unique for many reasons. One thing that makes several of them stand out is that drug use from their recent or distant past is not a major issue, is overshadowed by other issues or is not currently raising a furor in an era when views of some drugs are evolving.\nAlongside the investigation into whether Matt Gaetz had sex with an underage girl are reports of illicit drug use, all of which the former Florida congressman denies. It’s almost certain that he will be asked whether he has ever taken illegal drugs during Senate confirmation hearings for him to be the nation’s top attorney – a role in which he would oversee the Drug Enforcement Administration, among other agencies.\nRelated article\nWhat questions do you have before Trump returns to the White House?\nWhile Gaetz denies any drug use, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pleaded guilty to felony heroin possession in South Dakota in 1984, a grim chapter in his road to recovery. He openly talked about being an addict during the presidential campaign season.\nNow an advocate for healthier food, Kennedy wants to “Make America Healthy Again” as Trump’s pick for secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. But his vaccine skepticism has gotten more attention than his past. A classmate at Harvard University, the author Kurt Andersen, wrote in The Atlantic earlier this year that he bought cocaine from Kennedy while the two were students.\nKennedy brings his addiction worldview to prescription drugs such as those overseen by the Food and Drug Administration, which he would oversee if confirmed as HHS secretary. Of the popular weight loss drug Ozempic, for instance, Kennedy said on Fox News recently that pharmaceutical companies are “counting on selling it to Americans because we’re so stupid and so addicted to drugs.”\nElon Musk, meanwhile, has been tapped to co-lead the “Department of Government Efficiency.” While that isn’t an official Cabinet position, Musk’s companies are on the receiving end of billions in government contracts. He openly talks about his prescription use of ketamine, the drug many Americans likely first heard of with the death of actor Matthew Perry last year.\nAfter smoking marijuana in public during a live interview for Joe Rogan’s podcast in 2018, Musk said he agreed to undergo random drug testing for three years at the request of NASA, which pays billions of taxpayer dollars to Musk’s SpaceX. But Musk denied allegations of past drug use as reported in The Wall Street Journal early this year.\nFederal employees are barred from taking illegal drugs, and there are no reports to indicate that any of Trump’s Cabinet or other administration picks are using illegal drugs.\nIt is not unprecedented for Trump to hire people known to use drugs in the past. In Trump’s first term, his top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, had a history of drug use and had talked about his many years of sobriety. Kudlow is not angling for a role in Trump’s second term.\nCNN has reported that this year, Trump’s team is bypassing long and cumbersome FBI background checks for some of his Cabinet picks. Ultimately, it’s up to Trump, as president, to decide who he shares information with, according to CNN’s report.\nPast drug use was a major issue used by Republicans against the Biden White House, because the president’s son, Hunter, had faced addiction, which helped fuel behavior that led to federal gun and tax charges. But note that Hunter Biden is not a Cabinet-level official in the administration, nor has he had any official role.\nTrump, meanwhile, is a teetotaler and has said he never took drugs, had a drink of alcohol or smoked. He talked in depth about watching his brother, Fred, descend into alcoholism during an August appearance on Theo Von’s “This Past Weekend” podcast.\nRelated article\nTracking Trump’s picks for his Cabinet and administration\nTrump seemed interested by Von’s discussion of his own addiction and what it’s like to take drugs. “Cocaine will turn you into a damn owl, homie, you know what I’m saying?” Von told Trump.\nIn terms of policy, Von sounded adjacent to Kennedy when he complained of lobbyists for pharmaceutical companies – something on which Trump didn’t offer in-depth thoughts. He also did not mention that it was his Department of Justice during his first term that negotiated a controversial deal with the Sackler family that was recently struck down by the Supreme Court. The Sacklers are the family behind Purdue Pharma, the company that developed OxyContin, a highly addictive drug.\nTrump has been on both sides of how to address the nation’s drug problems and opioid epidemic. In one video, he both bragged about his efforts as president to help people in the throes of addiction but also promised to greatly expand use of the death penalty for drug dealers.\nHe has promised to pressure Chinese President Xi Jinping to cut down on the flow of ingredients used to make fentanyl out of China and into Mexico. That has also been a priority of the Biden administration. Trump has focused his pledge to shut the US border both as something that is required to stem the tide of undocumented immigrants as well as to fight cartels flooding the US with deadly fentanyl.\nTrump voted along with more than 55% of voters in Florida this month in favor of legalizing both marijuana and psychedelics for recreational purposes. It was a position that put him in opposition to Republican leaders in the state. In Florida, state constitutional amendments require 60% of the vote to pass, and the measure was defeated by a 44% minority of voters.\nThere is one drug-related item on which Joe Biden and Trump agree. When he endorsed Florida’s failed marijuana amendment, Trump said he would carry on with the process, begun by the Biden administration, of reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous substance in the eyes of the federal government.\n",

    "content": "For more than a decade, Chinese students have flocked to the United States, drawn by the prestige of an overseas education and the glamor of the American Dream. Education consultancies flourished across China, with parents paying big bucks for tutors and classes that promised to send their children abroad.\nBut that’s changing now – and recent statistics suggest the allure may be wearing off.\nDuring the last academic year, students from India became the largest group of international students in American higher education – knocking China off the top seat for the first time since 2009, according to figures released Monday by the State Department and the non-profit Institute of International Education.\nChina was still a major source, making up one fourth of all international students, compared to India’s 29%, the report found.\nBut experts say the decline reflects significant shifts in both policy and public perception, with many Chinese students and families worrying about safety, racism and discrimination, and immigration difficulties – especially as more options open up in other countries, including in China itself.\nRelated article\nToo few jobs, too many workers and ‘no plan B’: The time bomb hidden in India’s ‘economic miracle’\nMeanwhile, India overtook China as the world’s most populous country last year, and more than 40% of Indians are aged under 25 – prompting hopes of a youthful new engine for the global economy just as China’s population begins to dwindle and age. There were more than 331,600 Indian students in the US last academic year, according to the State Department.\n“We’re seeing from both sides, Chinese students studying in America and American students studying in China, the numbers are going down,” said Mallie Prytherch, a researcher at the University of Hong Kong’s Centre on Contemporary China and the World, who interviewed Beijing university students on their views toward the US during the pandemic.\nFor many Chinese students, “their parents, their teachers, had said, ‘Go to America, study, maybe you can even stay – you’ll get a good job, have a good life,’” she added. But the “onslaught” of racism and anti-Asian hate crimes during Donald Trump’s first presidency and the Covid-19 pandemic meant students became “disillusioned with this idea of the American Dream,” she said.\nIt was a different world in the late 2000s and early 2010s, when Chinese students first began surging overseas.\nAt the time, China was rapidly transforming from a poverty-stricken nation to an economic superpower, thanks to an “opening up” initiative that began in the late 1970s and saw sweeping reforms.\nIt also changed China’s relationship with the world. After China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 and hosted a tremendously successful Olympic Games in 2008, “there was this upturn in US-China relations – everyone had a really optimistic view of what China could be,” said Prytherch. “So there was a lot of openness in accepting students into America.”\nMany Chinese families were also newly wealthy in this flourishing economy. There was a feeling of “opening and moving out, and a chance to really go somewhere different,” Prytherch said.\nThe State Department’s figures reflect this trend – with the number of Chinese university students in the US rising from about 98,200 in 2009 to a record high of 369,500 in 2019. That also meant China became an increasingly lucrative market for American universities, who stepped up efforts to attract students from the nation.\nBut attitudes began changing by 2016 as Trump was in his first run for office, Prytherch said. US-China relations tanked in the following years, as the two countries engaged in a trade war and finger-pointing during the pandemic.\nThe downward spiral was reflected in policy, too: Trump imposed an executive order canceling the US’ Fulbright exchange program with China, then introduced a ban that effectively prevents graduate science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) students from several Chinese universities from gaining visas to the US, the world’s biggest research hub.\nIn 2020, the US revoked visas for more than 1,000 Chinese students and researchers deemed security risks. When President Joe Biden took office, many of those Trump-era policies were kept in place – making it difficult for Chinese grad students and researchers to secure a visa.\nIn January this year, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said in a briefing that “dozens of Chinese nationals, including international students, have been forcibly deported by the US each month.” He decried it as “discriminatory,” urging the US to protect the rights of Chinese students abroad.\nLi Jing, a research assistant at Tsinghua University in Beijing with a master’s degree in cybersecurity, told CNN in June he tried to attend an academic conference in the US but was denied a visa three times, costing him nearly $690 in the process.\n“I don’t know whether it’s my academic background that renders the visa denials,” he said.\nThe number of Chinese students in the US plunged during the pandemic and hasn’t rebounded since.\n“The total number of students from China has decreased in the last three years, primarily at the undergraduate level,” said Mirka Martel, research head at the Institute of International Education, at a briefing Monday announcing the latest figures.\nOne education consultancy, Education First, has seen a 10% decline in the number of Hong Kong and Macau students wanting to attend college in the US, according to general manager Steven Hon.\nThe State Department’s figures didn’t come as a surprise to many on Chinese social media platforms. “Since the economic sanctions and tech restrictions started in 2018, many (Chinese) students have been sent back home,” one user wrote on Weibo. Another user wrote: “The only reason I don’t want my child to study in the US is safety — issues like violence, robbery, gun violence, and drugs.”\nConcerns about safety have only risen since the pandemic brought a wave of anti-Asian racism and hate crimes. And while gun violence has always posed a worry for overseas families, the increased use of social media during the pandemic also meant attacks circulated more widely online, reaching more eyes in China, said Prytherch.\nRelated article\nA Trump-era policy that shut out top Chinese students could be hurting America more than Beijing\nThe US government’s handling of the pandemic also shook students in China, she added. Although many were also unhappy with Beijing’s strict zero-Covid policy and the chaotic end of its lockdown years, they still largely preferred that to the sense of Covid running rampant in the US – viewed not only as a failure of the government, but of democracy.\nDuring her research in Beijing, one student told Prytherch: “In America, they say you’re free, but if you can’t walk safely on the street, how is that freedom?”\nHowever, Hon said, the decline didn’t mean there was necessarily less appetite for an overseas education – just that there were more choices besides the US now.\n“The reason why we’ve seen a slight drop in the US is because there have been more immigration-friendly policies in other nations, like Canada, the UK and Australia,” he said. “Parents have a lot more options to choose from in terms of where they want to go, and what universities are willing to accept their children.”\nOne of those options is simply staying in China, where universities are growing in prestige, said Prytherch. Many Chinese professors previously based in the US are now returning to teach in China – partly because of the difficult conditions they faced in the US, but also because of the improvement in Chinese educational quality, she said.\nIn that context, many students no longer think an American education automatically grants them a competitive edge in the Chinese market unless they attended an Ivy League or a similar top university, she added. In fact, with more Chinese students eyeing the stability and benefits of government jobs, some even wonder if an overseas education might damage their chances of such a career.\nAll that said, the US is still a highly popular destination for students, said Hon, from Education First – especially graduate students in AI and tech, since the top schools and research grants in those fields are still largely American.\nAnd despite the tightening of immigration rules under the last two administrations, some US officials are still trying to encourage the flow of students.\n“I want to confirm that we very much welcome students from China to the US. We have the largest number of Chinese students studying outside of China here. We do know that US universities are continuing to value Chinese students,” said Marianne Craven of the State Department in a briefing this week, according to state-run outlet China Daily.\nWhether Chinese students believe that is another question.\n“A lot of (Chinese students) want families in the future, and they’ve begun to think that China is the best place to do that,” said Prytherch. “They think, you know what, China is not too bad anymore. At least it’s safe.”\nCNN’s Joyce Jiang contributed reporting.\n",

    "content": "When Florida Governor Ron DeSantis campaigned, briefly, for the GOP Republican presidential nomination last year, he said he wanted to \"Make America Florida.\" Though DeSantis may have failed in his primary bid take the Republican crown from Donald Trump, the president-elect might make his dreams come true anyway.\nDeSantis, once considered Trump's most formidable GOP challenger, rose to national prominence after he was endorsed by Trump to lead Trump's adopted home state six years ago. In 2020, when the Covid pandemic disrupted every facet of American life, DeSantis saw an opportunity to lead the right's growing frustrations with what conservatives view as unbridled wokeness amid the country's leftward drift. Once President Biden was elected that fall, DeSantis was well on his way to becoming a cultural crusader, with Florida's public school system his primary foil.\nNow that Trump is headed back to the White House, the president-elect has made clear that he has big plans for education policy. And his model will be based on what DeSantis has been doing from Talahasee.\n\"[Republicans] always try things in Florida first,\" former Education Secretary Arne Duncan told Newsweek. \"Florida leads the country in book banning, by far. They've tried to politicize the school board candidates there with the Moms for Liberty candidates.\" Duncan led the Department of Education for nearly seven years under former President Barack Obama.\nIn 2022, DeSantis ignited a national firestorm—and public feud with Disney—after signing a Parental Bill of Rights into law. The statute, which was dubbed the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill by critics, included a controversial section that prohibited public schools from having \"classroom discussion\" about sexual orientation or gender identity from kindergarten to third grade.\nIn the two years since, DeSantis has signed a string of other education bills into law, including legislation allowing parents to challenge books they feel are inappropriate, prohibiting the teaching of systemic racism, sexism or oppression and requiring the instruction of the \"dangers of communism.\"\nThe governor has also turned Florida into a haven for school choice, massively expanding voucher programs so that any Florida parent can transfer their children out of traditional public schools into private or charter schools with the funds their local public school would have received if they attended.\nAs of June, at least 17 other states have imposed bans and restrictions on race and gender identity being taught in K-12 education. At least 9 others have allowed teachers to disregard pronouns requested by students.\nHow Did Florida Become an Education Battleground?\nDeSantis has become the face of education reform in post-Covid America, but almost all of the credit is for Moms for Liberty to take. Born out of the lockdowns and school closures of 2020 and 2021, the Florida-based group was founded by three former school board members who wanted the government to recognize \"parental rights.\"\n\"The idea that the government somehow thinks they know better than parents for their children is absolutely ludicrous,\" Moms for Liberty co-founder Tiffany Justice told Newsweek. \"I'm very proud of the fact that in Florida, we've been able to grow a grassroots army able to lead the nation.\"\nJustice said the group had tried for years to get a \"parents' bill of rights\" passed, but that the legislation struggled to garner enough support even with a Republican-controlled state legislature. Then came the coronavirus. As most schools moved to virtual learning, parents suddenly found themselves in their children's classrooms.\nMoms for Liberty found their moment.\n\"We followed Governor DeSantis all around the state. Our moms made signs that said, 'Unmask our children,'\" Justice said. \"We wanted Governor DeSantis to push for the parent's bill of rights, which was eventually passed... but it really took that groundswell of grassroots support to give the governor and others courage to take a stand on that issue.\"\nFlorida's education policies, including bans on certain library books and discussion of sexual orientation and gender ideology, are used as a model for all of Moms of Liberty chapters, Justice said.\nThere is no doubt that the work of her group, which has expanded to 300 chapters across 48 states, has put Florida at the forefront of the parental rights conversation.\nZander Moricz, the 20-year-old founder and executive director of the Social Equity through Education (SEE Alliance), told Newsweek there's a variety reasons that his home state has become \"a battleground for education policy,\" but that pivotal to DeSantis' success in reforming Florida's school system is the relationship he built with groups like Moms for Liberty, ties that built a \"local coalition that could enact the ideology from small bases up into a large message.\"\n\"The local strategy, the school board strategy that DeSantis worked on and employed, is why Florida is such a controversial place for our culture wars and for our public-school policy,\" Moricz said.\nIn 2022, DeSantis endorsed 34 conservative school board candidates in a bid to grow the GOP's local education allies. When 29 of those candidates won, conservatives cheered. But 2024 was less kind to the governor. He endorsed 23 school board candidates this year, 11 of whom lost their races. Candidates endorsed by Florida Democrats, on the other hand, won 7 of 11 races that they ran in.\n\"Of course, we want parents more involved in the education of their children,\" Nikki Fried, the chair of the Florida Democratic Party, told Newsweek. \"That is always the goal of a healthy education system—the involvement of family. But what has happened is giving power to one group of parents over everybody else, whether it's Moms for Liberty's platform which has gotten into the school boards, which has made school board meetings very controversial, very erratic, filled with chaos.\"\n\"We have a lot of parents that are concerned that they may not be able to stay in traditional public schools, because the funding is being depleted, teachers are leaving,\" Fried said.\nAs school choice programs ballooned in Florida, public school enrollment has steeply declined. Since the 2019-2020 school year, some 53,000 students have left traditional public schools. Broward County, the state's second-largest school district, has lost more than 20,000 students. Now, officials are planning to close up to 42 campuses over the next few years.\nSchool choice opponents have warned that such programs hurt already chronically underfunded public schools by diverting much-needed tax dollars from the school systems.\nIn Texas, where Republican Governor Greg Abbott has made school choice a top priority, there has been pushback from state Republicans who represent rural districts where communities rely on public schools as a lifeline. Abbott successfully ousted enough of his GOP holdouts during this year's primaries, replacing them with more school choice-friendly Republicans, and is expected to pass the legislation next year.\nIn a statement sent to Newsweek, Florida's Department of Education defended its policies, noting that the state has been ranked as #1 in education for the last two years and #1 in higher education eight years in a row by U.S. News and World Report, which determines ratings by weighing multiple categories.\nWalletHub ranked Massachusetts as the #1 \"most educated\" state in 2024 based on education attainment and quality of education. Florida is 21 on WalletHub's list.\n\"Florida has been a national leader in quality education under the leadership of Governor DeSantis and many other states have followed the Florida blueprint in expanding school choice, eliminating DEI and CRT from classrooms and supporting parents' rights,\" Sydney Booker, the communication directors for Florida Department of Education, told Newsweek.\n\"The Florida Department of Education looks forward to working with the Trump Administration to continue to build on Florida's success,\" Booker added.\nOn the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly promised to \"close\" the U.S. Department of Education and \"move education\" back to the states. Education policy is largely controlled by state and local governments, although the DOE disburses federal funds to supplement those resources and fund programs, many of which are for low-income, at-risk or special education students.\nThe president-elect has also said he wants to cut funding for any school teaching critical race theory or \"transgender insanity,\" implement a nationwide school choice program, credential teachers who \"embrace patriotic values and support the American way of life\" and adopt merit pay for educators.\nJustice, the Moms for Liberty leader, appeared alongside Trump on the campaign trail and has been floated as his potential Education Secretary. She said parents should be \"thrilled\" to have Trump back in the White House \"because he puts parents back in the driver's seat when it comes to their children's education and the upbringing of their children.\"\n\"President-elect Trump has been very, very clear about the fact that he knows he has a mandate from the American people for school choice,\" Justice said. \"There are a lot of people that voted for him because they want to have the freedom to send their child to the school of their choosing. He's been very clear that that's something that he wants to do, and I have no doubt whoever he hires as the secretary of education is going to make sure that comes to fruition.\"\nBut others in Florida are issuing a warning to the rest of the country.\n\"[DeSantis] and the government of [his] administration of Florida... is trying to destroy public education, and now the national Republican Party seems to want to do the same thing,\" Crystal Etienne, a teacher in Miami-Dade County and the president of the Democratic Public Education Caucus of Florida, told Newsweek.\nNewsweek reached out to DeSantis for comment.\nWhile some parents, like Justice, are hoping for the national school choice program to become a reality, Etienne called it her \"biggest fear.\" She also argued that the reason DeSantis has been able to usher in so many changes is because the choice of education policy \"hasn't been given to the people in Florida.\"\n\"When you leave it to the people—we saw other states just this past election cycle that were able to defeat school choice,\" Etienne said. \"In Florida, it's not people making the decision. Florida is ruled by the governor and his far-right sycophants who are willing to do this.\"\nIn November, voters in Colorado, Nebraska and Kentucky all rejected ballot initiatives aimed at expanding school choice.\nMoricz, who went viral in 2021 for a speech he delivered at his high school graduation in Osprey, Florida, said: \"We've made the mistake here in Florida so that the rest of the country doesn't have to. We've learned the lesson the hard way so that the country doesn't have to.\"\n\"If Donald Trump really does decide to eradicate the Department of Education, it's going to be our students that feel the impact first,\" he said. \"It's going to be our students who feel what's actually happening. So, we're going to need to be prepared to listen to them and respond to what they're telling us in a large, organized fashion.\"\nAs the youngest plaintiff in a lawsuit challenging the state's Parental Rights Bill, Moricz has become a vocal student critic of DeSantis and one of Florida's most prominent student activists. He has been invited to speak at the DOE, met President Biden at the White House and led tens of thousands of students across Florida in a walkout against the governor's education policies.\nThis year, Moricz helped organize against a GOP-backed ballot initative to make school boards partisan. But Amendment 1, despite having majority support, failed to clear the 60 percent threshold needed to be approved. The \"No On One\" campaign reached 7 million voters in the final three weeks and led to a huge youth turnout, Moricz said.\n\"The vast majority of students want public schools to be strengthened. They want to be able to read what they'd like to read. They want to be able to show up to classrooms as themselves, and they want freedom in our public school system,\" he said. \"What DeSantis has been preaching and what DeSantis policies push forward is the antithesis of freedom.\"\nMoricz said he doesn't blame parents for supporting DeSantis, arguing that the governor leveraged pandemic-induced fears and created a \"toxic culture\" where parents were being inundated with the idea that their children were constantly \"in danger.\"\n\"The majority of families that are acting on these lies are not doing so in bad faith. They're doing so because they believe it's what's best for their families, and they're listening to the people they're supposed to be,\" he said.\nFlorida's conservative laboratory could offer a playbook for Trump to take the state's education policies nationwide, but Paul Reville, Massachusetts' former Secretary of Education, told Newsweek it would be unlikely that those laws could be applied sweepingly by the federal government.\n\"The states have the prerogative to do a lot of curriculum control and book control and things of that nature. The federal government doesn't really have any prerogatives as far as that goes,\" Reville said.\nUltimately, he said, it would be up to the states, who are already responsible for the education of its students.\n\"Some of the states have taken extreme measures that align with the culture wars. They'll feel reinforced by a federal administration that is supportive of that kind of policy and creates some incentives for [states] to double down on some of those kinds of things. But they won't do it unless there's an inclination in the state to do it,\" Reville said.\n\"There are a number of red states, but those red states already have many of these measures that we're talking about,\" he added. \"Florida already has what it has, and parents are adjusting to it, or they're picking up and leaving and going elsewhere for their children's education.\"\nBut Fried, the state's Democratic party chair, wasn't as convinced.\n\"Even if there aren't many direct resources that come from the Department of Education to our states—he can certainly dangle other types of federal dollars out there, only to them pull back,\" she said.\n\"He has other levers to pull, if he so chooses to really be hell bent on upending the public education system of this country.\"\n",

    "content": "If the NBA was looking to score a big ratings windfall to kick off a new season, this wasn't it.\nViewership for NBA games has dropped by double-digit percentages through the opening weeks of the regular season, according to Sports Media Watch. Compared to the same juncture in the 2023-24 NBA calendar, NBA ratings on ESPN are down 28 percent year over year. Ratings for the 2024 Boston Celtics-Dallas Mavericks Finals were reportedly the lowest the league has seen in three years.\nMore news: Spurs HC Gregg Popovich Revealed to Have Suffered Stroke\nViewership for most live sporting events has tailed off in the cord-cutting era. Traditional ratings metrics are still instrumental as a determining factor in advertising revenues, even though they fail to capture an audience that increasingly relies on streaming platforms to watch games.\nNonetheless, any significant dip in ratings has the attention of the league offices in Manhattan. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has an interesting theory as to why this year's television ratings are down.\n\"I think we're just looking at a couple weeks of ratings,\" Silver told Front Office Sports. \"There's always some unique things. This year we were up against the World Series, Dodgers-Yankees, two very attractive teams, they brought in a big audience. You had a presidential election which was commanding an enormous amount of attention. So I don't think it has anything whatsoever to do with the style of play on the floor.\"\nRatings for the World Series on Fox were the best MLB has seen since 2017. The Los Angeles Dodgers' five-game series victory over the New York Yankees was just the tip of a month-long iceberg. Fox said its coverage of the 2024 baseball postseason averaged 7,485,000 viewers in all — a 42 percent increase compared to last year's average (5,265,000).\nMore news: Blockbuster ESPN-TNT 'Inside the NBA' Trade Terms Leaked in New Report\nAny presidential election is an inherently seminal event, guaranteed to deliver ratings for news-focused networks like CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC in early November, as well as the traditional \"Big 3\" networks — CBS, NBC, and ABC. Donald Trump's victory over Kamala Harris was an event that effectively unfolded over two days (Nov. 5-6) but had viewers tuned in for daily updates much earlier. The new NBA season tipped off Oct. 22.\nSilver told FOS he is bullish about the league's social media reach, and its potential streaming audience in the wake of a new contract with Amazon Prime set to take effect next year. But is the commissioner correct in laying blame for the NBA's poor ratings on events far beyond the league's control?\nTime will tell. The second and third weeks of November offered the league a fresh start in the eyes of viewers who were perhaps too consumed with everything else in the world to give a new NBA season a chance.\nFor more NBA news, visit Newsweek Sports.\n",

    "content": "A “once in a decade” bomb cyclone is sweeping through the northwest United States and parts of Canada early Wednesday –– leaving at least one person dead and hundreds of thousands without power across Washington state, California and British Columbia.\nIn Seattle and neighboring cities, strong winds are tumbling trees, with some falling on houses and placing lives at risk.\nIn Lynnwood, north of Seattle, a woman in her 50s was killed when a large tree fell on a homeless encampment shortly after 7 p.m. PT, South County Fire Department told CNN.\nMore than 650,000 customers lost power in the early hours of Wednesday in Washington, while about 140,000 customers were without power in British Columbia, BC Hydro reported on its website. As of midnight PT, over 24,000 customers in California were without power.\nThe National Weather Service has reported notable wind gusts across the region, including off the coast of British Columbia, where winds were blowing at 101 mph at the South Brooks Buoy.\nGusts of 72 to 77 mph were recorded in Washington state, including at Cape Elizabeth on the Olympic Peninsula and at Crystal Mountain and Sunrise-Mount Rainier inland southeast of Seattle.\n“It’s severe out there. Trees are coming down all over the city, with multiple falling onto homes,” the fire department in Bellevue, east of Seattle, posted in a Severe Weather Safety alert on Facebook. “If you are able, head to the lowest floor you can and stay away from windows. Do not go outside if you can avoid it.”\nVideos obtained by CNN show multiple fallen trees on power lines in Lake Stevens, Snohomish County, north of Seattle, with Snohomish Regional Fire and Rescue saying that there are “many trees and power lines down.”\nIn Maple Valley, a city southeast of Seattle, two people were rescued after a tree fell on their trailer, according to Puget Sound Fire. One patient was freed quickly, while it took firefighters an hour to extricate the second. Both patients were transferred to a nearby hospital.\nAn Amtrak train collided with a fallen tree near an intersection in Stanwood, north of Seattle on Tuesday night, according to CNN affiliate KIRO. The incident left the train inoperable, though none of the 47 passengers on board sustained injuries, KIRO reported. CNN reached out to Amtrak for more information.\nSeveral school districts in western Washington will be closed or delayed on Wednesday due to the impact of the storm.\n“Due to widespread power outages, fallen trees, and high winds in some areas, all school buildings will be closed on Wednesday, November 20th, and all after-school activities have been canceled,” the Eatonville School District, 60 miles south of Seattle, shared on social media.\nAcross western Oregon, winds of 30 to 50 mph were reported with gusts along the coast and offshore reaching over 70 mph late Tuesday. In Northern California, gusts offshore reached 60 mph with the high peaks in Humboldt reaching 80 mph.\nThe powerful “bomb cyclone” will combine with an atmospheric river to unleash over a month’s worth of rain, hurricane-force wind gusts and feet of mountain snow to parts of the Pacific Northwest and Northern California.\nThe storm system rapidly intensified on Tuesday in a phenomenon called “bombogenesis” and earn it the moniker of “bomb cyclone.” It intensified so much so quickly that it could become a “triple-bomb,” tripling the criteria needed to be considered a bomb cyclone, the National Weather Service in San Francisco said.\nBomb cyclones are formidable and unload heavy snow and strong winds during the winter. This one is one of the most intense on record for its location, a storm that occurs only “about once every ten years,” and will generate “some of the strongest winds we have seen in several years” that churn up “very dangerous mountainous seas of 30 to 35 feet,” the National Weather Service in Medford, Oregon, said.\nThis bomb cyclone will work with an atmospheric river, a long plume of water vapor moving like a river through the atmosphere, to wring out heavy rainfall and significant mountain snowfall in the Pacific Northwest and Northern California. The pair will stall along the coast and hammer the area with hazardous conditions through the week and into the weekend.\nParts of northwestern California could record 16 inches of rain or more in 48 hours. More than a month’s worth of rain is expected in the northern San Francisco Bay area, primarily north of the Golden Gate Bridge, the weather service there said. Rainfall of this magnitude is expected to cause significant urban flooding, debris flow on roadways and river flooding.\nA level 2 of 4 threat of flooding rainfall is in effect for parts of northwestern California and southwestern Oregon where 2 to 5 inches of rain could fall, the Weather Prediction Center said.\nThe heaviest rainfall is expected to begin Wednesday and peak Thursday across northwestern California. A level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in effect there for Wednesday and a rare level 4 of 4 high risk is in place for Thursday, according to the WPC.\nIt’s hard to overstate how big of a deal these high risks are. They are issued on fewer than 4% of days per year on average, but are responsible for more than 80% of all flood-related damage and 40% of all flood-related deaths, research from the WPC shows.\nThree to 6 inches of rain could fall Wednesday with some spots getting up to 8 inches. Thursday’s rainfall could meet or exceed Wednesday’s totals, especially in the high risk area.\nHeavy snowfall is expected across higher elevation areas, where winter weather alerts are in place. Blizzard warnings are in effect across parts of the Washington Cascades, where snowfall over a foot and gusts of up to 60 mph are possible Tuesday afternoon through Wednesday morning.\n“Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Strong winds could cause extensive damage to trees and power lines,” the National Weather Service office in Seattle warned.\nOne to 4 feet of snow is possible Tuesday through Wednesday across the Cascades and the northern Sierra Nevada. Snowfall could create impossible travel conditions on Interstate 5 and Highways 31, 36, 66, 89, 97 and 140.\nPowerful winds were expected to be particularly strong off the coast late Tuesday and rare hurricane-force wind warnings were issued for much of the coastal waters of the Pacific Northwest.\nWidespread winds of 35 to 50 mph are possible inland with tropical storm-force gusts to 70 mph. Isolated gusts in higher elevation areas and across capes and headlands could hit 85 mph, or hurricane force.\nThese powerful winds could cause potentially widespread power outages and damage to buildings and create difficult travel, especially for high-profile vehicles.\nConditions will start to improve by the weekend, but lighter rain could continue into next week.\nCNN’s Isaac Yee and Hanna Park contributed to this report.\n",

He is just the second president in history to win a nonconsecutive term.\n“I want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honor of being elected your 47th president and your 45th president,” Trump said at an election-night event in West Palm Beach, Florida. “This will truly be the golden age of America.”\nTrump’s victory comes in the same year that he was convicted of a felony and escaped two attempts on his life. In July, Trump was shot in the ear during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\nHarris, the nation’s first female vice president, was hoping to shatter a nearly 250-year-old glass ceiling to become the nation’s first female president. She became the Democratic Party’s nominee this summer, not long after Joe Biden’s unprecedented exit from the race.\n“The outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for,” she said in her concession speech Wednesday. “But hear me when I say: The light of America’s promise will always burn bright.”\nHere are some of the stories that made headlines over the past week, as well as some photos that caught our eye.\nEditor’s note: This gallery contains an image from Lebanon that may be disturbing to some readers.

    "content": "Doing more aerobic exercise in middle age and old age may reduce the risk of dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease, a new study found.\n“Our study underscores the critical role of cardiovascular fitness in reducing dementia risk, even for those genetically predisposed to Alzheimer’s disease,” said Weili Xu, a professor in the Aging Research Center at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.\n“Encouraging gradual fitness improvements offers a practical and impactful way to support brain health across diverse populations,” Xu, senior author of the study, said in an email.\nOverall, people in the best cardiorespiratory shape had better cognitive function and only a 0.6% relative long-term risk for dementia compared to those who were not so fit — a benefit that delayed the onset of dementia by 1.5 years, according to the study.\nCardiorespiratory endurance, which is developed by regular aerobic exercise, boosts oxygen uptake in the lungs and heart and helps people sustain high-intensity activities over an extended period without getting tired.\nThe study found an even bigger benefit was seen for people with a genetic predisposition for Alzheimer’s —those with the most cardiorespiratory endurance had a 35% lower relative risk of developing the disease.\n“There is a saying — genes are not our destiny; we can all make proactive choices to help win the tug-of-war against our genes. This study wholly supports that,” said preventive neurologist Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida, who was not involved in the study.\nRelated article\nKnee pain in the US increased 65% over the past 20 years. Easy exercises can help\n“I’ve always considered exercise like a miracle ‘drug’ that has brain-boosting effects,” Isaacson said in an email.\n“While in this study higher fitness alone delayed onset of dementia by 1.5 years, we can do even better by also following a healthy diet, managing cholesterol, blood pressure and blood sugar, getting regular hearing and vision checks, and prioritizing sleep.”\nStudies show a low level of cardiorespiratory fitness is a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease such as heart attacks and premature death from all causes, including cancer, according to studies.\nWithout effort, however, cardiorespiratory fitness declines as people age. According to a scientific statement by the American Heart Association, it declines at a rate of 3% to 6% during people’s 20s and 30s and increases to a rate of more than 20% per decade in their 70s and beyond.\nThe new study, published Tuesday in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, analyzed data on over 61,00 dementia-free people aged 39 to 70 years who enrolled in the UK Biobank, a longitudinal study of over half a million UK citizens.\nRelated article\nExercise changes the brain in a way that helps heart health, especially for people with depression\nA baseline test of cardiorespiratory fitness was made when people first enrolled between 2009 and 2010, along with tests of cognitive function and genetic risk. Twelve years later researchers looked to see if there was a connection between the group’s fitness more than a decade prior and any current diagnosis of dementia.\n“This study found a dose-dependent — meaning more was better — effect of exercise fitness on several critical types of cognitive performance,” Isaacson said. “Across different types of memory, such as recalling specific words and numbers or remembering to perform a planned future action, like making an appointment, cardiorespiratory fitness can really move the needle.”\nBeing aerobically fit can also improve how fast the brain thinks, as in how fast words and ideas can travel from point A to point B in the brain, he added.\n“To use a car analogy, the more fit a person is, the more effectively they can shift into higher mental gear and the faster they can go,” Isaacson said.\nThe study was observational, which means no direct cause and effect can be determined, said cardiologist Dr. Valentin Fuster, president of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital and physician-in-chief of Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.\nThe study’s results should also be interpreted with caution due to the health concerns of people who were low in cardiorespiratory fitness, said Fuster, who is a former president of the American Heart Association and World Heart Federation.\n“When you look at the groups of patients who had low cardiovascular respiratory fitness versus those who had moderate or high fitness, there is something very striking,” Fuster said. “It was those with low fitness who had more hypertension, more diabetes, high cholesterol and more obesity.”\nRelated article\nSitting too much linked to heart disease –– even if you work out, according to new study\nAll of those health conditions are triggers for cardiovascular disease and damage to small blood vessels, including those in the brain, he said. The study showed that people with high cardiorespiratory fitness were more likely to take care of themselves, and therefore protect the heart-brain connection.\n“This is critical for the future, this heart brain connection,” Fuster said. “The same risk factors that affect cardiovascular disease may play a role in the development of vascular dementia, and even there is some data suggesting they play a role in the acceleration of the Alzheimer’s disease.”\nWhat’s the best way to increase your cardiorespiratory fitness and protect your heart and brain? Pick an aerobic exercise and do it at an intensity that takes your breath and makes it hard to hold a conversation, experts say.\nRelated article\nNo-jump HIIT workouts are a great option for many\n“An aerobic exercise is either with a bicycle with low resistance, a treadmill with low resistance, or walking in the street at a reasonable speed — but do it for at least half an hour, five days a week,” Fuster said.\nOther options include vigorous dancing, hiking, jogging, running, rowing, stair climbing or swimming. Team sports such as basketball, soccer and hockey will also raise the heart rate and boost oxygen flow. High-intensity interval training, in which high intensity exercise is mixed with activity at a lower intensity, can boost cardiovascular endurance by up to 79%, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\nThere are other benefits as well — exercise helps with weight loss, mood stabilization and good sleep. It can also lengthen your life.\n",

    "content": "The Biden administration has approved sending anti-personnel mines to Ukraine for the first time in another major policy shift, according to two US officials. The decision comes just days after the US gave Ukraine permission to fire long-range US missiles at targets in Russia, a shift that only occurred after months of lobbying from Kyiv.\nThe US intends for Kyiv to use the anti-personnel mines in the eastern part of the country, where Russian troops have made slow and steady progress against Ukrainian defensive lines. The grinding battle has cost Moscow tremendously, with Ukraine claiming Russia suffered its highest number of casualties this week. But Russia’s unrelenting pressure, coupled with shortages in Ukrainian manpower and ammunition, has allowed the Russian military to gradually seize more territory.\nThe US expects Ukraine to use these anti-personnel mines to bolster defensive lines within sovereign Ukrainian territory, not as an offensive capability in Russia. The US has also sought assurances that Ukraine will try to limit the risk to civilians from the mines.\nRelated article\nBiden’s major missile reversal complicates potential western diplomatic thaw with Moscow\nThe administration’s decision was first reported by the Washington Post.\nSince the early days of the war, the US has provided Ukraine with anti-tank mines to blunt Russia’s numerical superiority in armored vehicles. But until now, the Biden administration had not provided Ukraine with anti-personnel mines over concerns about the enduring danger they may pose. Human rights groups have long criticized the use of anti-personnel mines because they can kill indiscriminately and can remain armed for years after the conflict in which they were initially used has ended.\nIn June 2022 – four months after the start of the war in Ukraine – the Biden administration pledged to limit the use of anti-personnel mines. In announcing the decision, which was a reversal from the earlier Trump administration, the White House said there was a “need to curtail the use of (anti-personnel mines) worldwide.” The US said that it would no longer develop or export anti-personnel mines and would work to destroy all of its existing stockpiles. (The one exception to the policy was South Korea.)\nThe announcement of anti-personnel mines for Ukraine, especially with only weeks left in the Biden administration, is a sudden change on what had been a long-standing policy.\nAfter the US allowed Ukraine to use longer-range US-made missiles on Russian targets, Russia's president updates nuclear-use policy to include more scenarios.\nRelated video\nPutin rattles nuclear saber over US role in Ukraine\nThe type of mines the US provides to Ukraine will be “non-persistent,” according to the officials, meaning they have an internal mechanism to shorten the lifespan of the trigger. The mines are designed to become inert after a set period of time ranging from as little as four hours to two weeks, the officials said. The mines use an electrical fuse that requires a battery, and the mine becomes inert when the battery runs out.\nRussia has deployed anti-personnel mines and anti-tank mines since the earliest days of the war. As Russian forces advanced into Ukraine and established their own defensive lines, they established minefields to slow any Ukraine counterattack. Last summer, as Ukrainian forces mounted an ultimately unsuccessful counteroffensive, one Ukrainian official described the density of Russian mines as “insane.”\n",

    "content": "In the annals of American broadcast journalism, the Fairness Doctrine stands as a testament to a time when balanced reporting was more than a noble pursuit; it was a mandated practice.\nThe policy, established by the Federal Communications Commission in 1949, obligated broadcasters to present contrasting viewpoints on contentious public issues.\nThis era of regulated balance came to an end in 1987 when President Ronald Reagan's FCC decided that the increasing diversity of media outlets meant the doctrine was no longer required. This pivotal shift laid the groundwork for significant transformations in the media landscape.\nIn the post-Fairness Doctrine era, we have witnessed an unprecedented polarization of American media. Freed from the obligation to present differing perspectives, many media outlets have defaulted to presenting narratives through a singular ideological lens.\nThe end of the Fairness Doctrine isn't the sole cause of media polarization, of course. The advent of social media and the algorithm-driven delivery of news, coupled with business incentives that prioritize engagement over balance, have exacerbated the divide. The outrage economy is a self-perpetuating system.\nThese shifts have profoundly affected our democratic society. Public discourse, once anchored in a commonly accepted set of facts, has fractured into micro-environments, subsets and cohorts, each espousing its unique version of reality. This accelerates the erosion of civil dialogue, undermining a critical component of our democracy. In this polarized media landscape, trust in the so-called fourth estate has plummeted to an all-time low.\nSocial media platforms, with their indiscriminate blending of content from trusted news outlets and dubious blogs, have furthered this erosion.\nThe shift towards subscription-based business models is a double-edged sword. While it has provided a lifeline to many media organizations in the face of shrinking advertising revenues, it has also inadvertently deepened the echo chambers. By prioritizing content that affirms their subscribers' worldviews, media outlets perpetuate these bubbles. And with quality journalism often locked behind paywalls, the information divide grows wider, further threatening the democratic ideal of an informed citizenry.\nIn the face of these challenges, it's crucial to remember that the principles of the Fairness Doctrine, though no longer legally enforced, needn't be abandoned. Instead, we should strive to voluntarily integrate these principles into our journalistic practices. By emphasizing fairness, balance and a representation of diverse viewpoints in our reporting, we can begin to counteract the rampant polarization that currently plagues our media and, by extension, our public discourse.\nNavigating today's media landscape is challenging. It's shaped by a web of social, technological and economic factors that defy easy solutions. Meanwhile, the erosion of civil dialogue, the declining trust in media, and the fragmentation of our public discourse pose serious threats to our democracy.\nWe need to raise our journalistic standards. Both-sides-ism isn't fairness — it's a failure of critical thinking or intellectual honesty. Let's not be naive: There are people and interests who deliberately skew our public discourse through misdirection, false equivalence and outright lies. We must counter those pernicious efforts by demanding a commitment to good-faith debate, which will pay dividends in rebuilding the trust that across the spectrum of ideas.\nAdopting a voluntary commitment to the principles embodied in the Fairness Doctrine represents a step in the right direction. It signals our dedication to upholding the ethical tenets of journalism, our respect for diverse viewpoints and our unwavering commitment to nourishing an informed and balanced public discourse.\nWhen fairness is no longer a doctrine, it must become a practice. Our democracy, in its present state, urgently requires this shift. For the media industry, it's not just a question of ethical responsibility but an existential imperative. The very health of our democratic society might depend on it.\nOriginally published on Poynter.org\n",

    "content": "President-elect Donald Trump's tapping of billionaire professional wrestling mogul Linda McMahon to be secretary of the Department of Education has been criticized by educators.\nCritics see the nomination as the latest instance of Trump selecting a loyalist to serve in his incoming administration over someone with more relevant experience.\n\"By selecting Linda McMahon, Donald Trump is showing that he could not care less about our students' futures,\" Becky Pringle, the president of the National Education Association, said in a statement. She added, \"McMahon's only mission is to eliminate the Department of Education and take away taxpayer dollars from public schools.\"\nShaun Harper, a professor of education, public policy and business at the University of Southern California, told the Los Angeles Times: \"America's schoolchildren and college students deserved an Education Secretary who brings deep education experience to the role.\n\"Instead, they got a former World Wrestling Entertainment executive. This is embarrassing and a slap in the face to our nation's talented educators.\"\nIn his announcement, Trump said McMahon would use her \"decades of Leadership experience, and deep understanding of both Education and Business, to empower the next Generation of American Students and Workers, and make America Number One in Education in the World.\"\nMcMahon has minimal experience in education, having served for one year on the Connecticut Board of Education starting in 2009, the Associated Press reported. She also spent years on the board of Sacred Heart University, a Catholic school in Connecticut.\nHer background in business is more extensive. McMahon and her husband, Vince McMahon, founded the company now known as World Wrestling Entertainment in 1980, and she served as the company's president and then its chief executive until 2009, when she stepped down to enter politics.\nMcMahon ran unsuccessfully twice as a Republican for the U.S. Senate in Connecticut. Her husband stepped down from his role as CEO of WWE amid an investigation into allegations of sex trafficking, and a lawsuit filed last month accuses WWE's founders of fostering a culture of sexual abuse within the organization.\nMcMahon, who led the Small Business Administration during Trump's first term, later chaired the board of the America First Policy Institute, a Trump-connected think tank. She was also a co-chair of Trump's transition team.\nIn his statement, the president-elect touted McMahon's advocacy for school choice, saying, \"Linda will fight tirelessly to expand 'Choice' to every State in America, and empower parents to make the best Education decisions for their families.\"\nHe also said she would spearhead efforts to \"send Education BACK TO THE STATES,\" possibly referring to his pledge to dismantle the Department of Education.\nNewsweek contacted a Trump spokesperson for comment via email outside normal working hours.\nPringle said in her response to the announcement: \"During his first term, Donald Trump appointed Betsy DeVos to undermine and ultimately privatize public schools through vouchers.\n\"Now, he and Linda McMahon are back at it with their extreme Project 2025 proposal to eliminate the Department of Education, steal resources for our most vulnerable students, increase class sizes, cut job training programs, make higher education more expensive and out of reach for middle class families, take away special education services for disabled students, and put student civil rights protections at risk.\"\nShe added: \"The Senate must stand up for our students and reject Donald Trump's unqualified nominee, Linda McMahon. Our students and our nation deserve so much better than Betsy DeVos 2.0.\"\nRandi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, said that while little is known about McMahon's views, the union would \"try to work with anyone who puts the aspirations of our students, families and communities first.\"\n\"While we expect that we will disagree with Linda McMahon on many issues, our devotion to kids requires us to work together on policies that can improve the lives of students, their families, their educators and their communities,\" she said in a statement.\nNewsweek contacted Pringle, Harper and Weingarten for comment via email outside normal working hours.\nWhile McMahon's nomination was met with criticism from some educators, other individuals welcomed Trump's selection as a win for parental rights.\n\"Congratulations @Linda_McMahon on being named Secretary of Education!\" Tiffany Justice, a co-founder of the parental rights group Moms for Liberty, wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\"Let's put parents back in the drivers seat by supporting Linda as she works for a future where education is directed by parents and is focused on equipping students for success in the real world,\" she added.\nTennessee Governor Bill Lee, a Republican, called McMahon \"a proven leader who has delivered school choice for families across the nation.\"\nHe wrote on X, \"As Secretary of Education, she'll work with @realDonaldTrump to empower parents with education freedom & send education back to the states so that every child can thrive.\"\n",

    "content": "Hakeem Jeffries nearly became House speaker. Instead, he’s steering the Democratic Party through an identity crisis and hoping to avoid an ugly intraparty civil war.\nEven without the gavel, many Democrats across Washington say House Minority Leader Jeffries — a 54-year-old New Yorker with centrist roots and messaging chops — is about to become the de facto voice of the party’s future and the face of resistance to Donald Trump. As expected, he was reelected to lead the House Democratic caucus on Tuesday, and he did not face a challenge.\nSo far, Jeffries has said little about his role in the party’s postelection rebuild. But his allies say he’s aware of the part he’s about to play. And many are making the case directly to him: Multiple Democratic donors have personally urged him to “take the lead” until the party has a new official leader, according to two people familiar with the discussions.\n“‘You are the guy for the entire country right now,’” Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a longtime ally, recalled recently telling Jeffries. “I don’t think he’s ever tried to reach that kind of position, but it’s on him.”\nJeffries is already playing referee in some of the biggest internal spats emerging from the election. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus, for instance, is privately sparring over how the party should handle Trump’s promised mass deportations. Progressives are seething over corporate influence in internal meetings. One group of centrists has even privately discussed a contentious term limits proposal aimed at the party’s old-guard committee leaders, according to two people familiar with the conversations.\nOne of Jeffries’ most urgent questions will be how to handle another two years in the minority — this time, in a GOP-run Washington. He and his leadership team are already discussing how to avoid a repeat of 2016, when Democrats “chased Donald Trump every hour” while failing to deliver their own message, according to one leadership aide. There are even some preliminary talks about sending Jeffries and leadership to battleground turf around the county to help diagnose their party’s failings outside of Capitol Hill.\nBack in Washington, even though Democrats will be in the minority, they have a significant role to play in a House with a narrow Republican majority where GOP infighting over the last two years led to one of the least productive sessions ever. In the last Congress, Democrats repeatedly helped Republicans keep the government open and propped up Speaker Mike Johnson when he faced a challenge to his leadership post. In a new era under a Trump administration with Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress, Democrats are weighing whether they want to continue to extend a lifeline, with many expressing their ideas to Jeffries directly.\n“We have to take a long hard look at what our leverage is” Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the influential House Appropriations Committee, told CNN.\nEven before the election, Jeffries had been aggressively working behind the scenes to try to convince the Biden-Harris administration to sharpen its economic strategy. In meetings with White House advisers, Jeffries frequently paraphrased a famed Hollywood quote that every good story needs a good villain, according to two people who’ve heard him say it, as he urged Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to make an enemy out of corporations over price gouging. For more than a year, he was on a “crusade” with the Biden-Harris team, urging them to craft a more hard-hitting, succinct economic message, that person said. He even tapped other senior House Democrats to echo his message to the Biden team, according to another person familiar with the efforts.\nStill, unlike some in his party, Jeffries is not in despair, according to multiple people familiar with his thinking. He believes he has a road map to flip the House in 2026 that looks a lot like the way he helped his party win back most of its New York seats this year. Democrats there dramatically overperformed Harris. And with his skill in recruiting candidates, some Democratic operatives are already talking about ways for Jeffries to be more involved in primaries — not just general elections — to ensure their party has the best chance at flipping the shrinking number of competitive seats nationwide.\nSome are more pessimistic: Several Democrats told CNN the party won’t be fixed in Washington and that the fact that the party lost battleground seats in New York in the 2022 midterms was a clear warning sign. But Democrats say Jeffries — alongside Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who will serve as minority leader in the next Congress — might be the best person to at least try.\n“He is the next generation,” said Rep. Gregory Meeks, a fellow New York Democrat. “He can talk hip-hop and he can talk civil rights.”\nFlanked by newly elected members of Congress, Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal had a bold prediction for how Democrats will operate in the next Congress: “Democrats will be united for a block and tackle and let [Republicans] figure out how they’re going to run.”\nNot all Democrats feel that way.\nHouse Rules Committee Chair Jim McGovern, whose panel plays a key role in determining what legislation gets brought to the House floor, is listening to Johnny Cash’s rendition of “I Won’t Back Down” as he prepares for the next Congress. But McGovern believes his party should look for opportunities to work with Republicans when the situation presents itself: “If there are areas we can work together, absolutely.”\nFor his part, Jeffries has telegraphed that he is open to working with Republicans, but — this time — does not want to get caught responding to Trump’s every move. Multiple members have approached Jeffries to weigh in on how the caucus should approach the strategy.\nPledging to work with Republicans when possible, Jeffries said, “The House Democratic Caucus will be a check and balance on this incoming administration. That’s not a partisan strategy. That’s James Madison’s strategy. So we’re going to do it.”\nBut when asked to respond to Trump’s string of controversial Cabinet picks, Jeffries didn’t hesitate to draw a line.\n“No, that I’m not doing, because that’s all a distraction,” he said.\nOne of Jeffries’ toughest tasks will be keeping Democrats unified on immigration despite the many intraparty divisions.\nThose cracks are already beginning to show. At a meeting of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus last week, Democrats heard from a panel of immigration experts about Trump’s mass deportation plans.\nBut things quickly got tense. At one point, one of the experts mentioned undocumented immigrants sitting in jail cells, and Rep. Henry Cuellar, a famously outspoken member on border issues, spoke up.\n“I hope all of us are for deporting undocumented criminals,” Cuellar said as he looked around at fellow Democrats and an awkward silence fell over the room, according to three people who attended the meeting.\nAnd that’s not the only time Democrats like Cuellar have spoken up to party leaders since the election.\nJeffries sat quietly alongside his two deputies as multiple fellow Democrats — including Reps. Gabe Vasquez of New Mexico, Susie Lee of Nevada and Scott Peters of California — spoke up about the role that border issues played in the party’s tough losses this month, according to two people in the room.\nIn the Democrats’ first postmortem “listening sessions,” these lawmakers said the party failed to address issues such as border security and crime. While Democrats did attempt a border deal with Republicans earlier this Congress, they said it happened far too late.\nThe border was not the only issue Democrats feel they were late to develop an inclusive response to, leading many to say that in this soul-searching period, the party needs to develop a better strategy of responding early and often.\n“Democrats have to figure out how to communicate, where to communicate and on what mediums,” one lawmaker told CNN.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\nCNN’s Ali Main and Haley Talbot contributed to this report.\n",

    "content": "As the premiere of Outlander Season 7 is only days away, fans of the hit show are starting to wonder when the popular series will end.\nOutlander first began airing in 2014, based on the historical fantasy novels by author Diana Gabaldon. The show follows Claire Randall (Caitríona Balfe) after she is transported back in time from 1945 to 1743 Scotland, where she meets and falls in love with Jamie Fraser (Sam Heughan).\nThe first half of Season 7, released over a year ago, ended with Claire, Jamie, and Young Ian (John Bell) returning to their beloved Scotland. Season 7, Part 2 starts airing on Starz on November 22—and there is a lot of drama in store. \"It's such an emotional roller coaster,\" executive producer Maril Davis says of the season's second half during an October 17 panel discussion at New York Comic Con. \"Death, loss, redemption... everything is in the second half.\"\nWhile Outlander is fast approaching its conclusion, there's no need for fans to be too upset just yet, as Season 8 will be the series' final chapter. Here is everything you need to know about the final season, as well as the future of the franchise.\nNewsweek emailed Starz for comment on Wednesday outside of normal business hours.\nThe story will continue where Part 1 left off, with Jamie, Claire, and Young Ian sailing back to Scotland. However, pleasant homecomings in Outlander are fleeting, and the Frasers will be wrenched apart once more when Lord John Grey's nephew is injured in the American Revolution. Jamie and Claire's marriage will be tested like never before as they face the perils of the armed conflict.\nMeanwhile, Roger (Richard Rankin) and Brianna (Sophie Skelton) are separated across time as Roger goes after their son Jemmy through the stones. Viewers will also see favorites Geillis Duncan (Lotte Verbeek) and Dougal MacKenzie (Graham McTavish) return for the season's second half, which comprises eight episodes.\nExecutive producer Davis said at New York Comic Con in October that Episode 11 may be the most talked about, adding: \"Bring your whiskey, your tissues, it's pretty intense.\"\nBalfe and Heughan will reprise their roles as Claire and Jamie Fraser in the final season. Bell will also return as Young Ian. Others returning in Season 8 are Lauren Lyle as Marsali, César Domboy playing Fergus Fraser, Skelton as Brianna and Rankin as Roger Mackenzie.\nNew cast members include Kieran Bew playing Captain Charles Cunningham, a retired British soldier, Frances Tomelty as Elspeth Cunningham, Captain Charles Cunningham's mother and Carla Woodcock for the role of Amaranthus Grey, a new member of the Grey family.\nFilming for Season 8 wrapped in late September 2024 in Scotland and is expected to premiere in 2025 or 2026. An exact date has not been announced.\nThe season will begin with Claire, Jamie, and Young Ian returning to Scotland for the first time since Season 3. They will confront the trials of the Revolutionary War, having to choose between fighting for the land they have called home and sticking by their loved ones.\nThe show's eighth season will have 10 episodes in total, which will bring the story to a close following its 16-episode seventh season. Claire and Jamie's story will reach its natural conclusion in its final episodes.\nAs Gabaldon has only published nine out of a planned 10 volumes, with the last book still being written, the showrunners created their own ending for Claire and Jamie in the season finale. To avoid spoilers, the plot for the final season is being kept under wraps.\nSeason 8 will be Outlander's final installment, with production for the eighth and final season beginning in March 2024 and ending on September 27, 2024. The showrunners discussed the show's conclusion with Gabaldon beforehand.\n\"We are ending [the show] the way we are, we just wanted to be respectful of not ending it the way maybe the way she [Gabaldon] would,\" Davis said.\nSo what did Gabaldon think about it? \"It was interesting... I was not upset by it,\" she said. \"It was not something I wrote, so I'm very objective about it. It was well done, I think it will work very nicely.\"\nIn a statement, Kathryn Busby, president of original programming for Starz, said: \"For nearly a decade Outlander has won the hearts of audiences worldwide and we're pleased to bring Claire and Jamie's epic love story to a proper conclusion.\n\"But before we close this chapter there is plenty of their passionate story to tell over the course of 26 new episodes and even more to explore of this dynamic world and its origin story. We're thrilled to continue to partner with Matthew, Maril and Ronald and can't wait to see where their alluring storytelling takes us next.\"\nAfter they concluded filming, Balfe and Heughan took to Instagram to share emotional farewells to their characters.\nBalfe shared a carousel of various photos from throughout the show's run, thanking author Gabaldon, showrunner Ronald D. Moore, and the cast and crew.\n\"How to capture a life ....?\" she wrote in the caption. \"Claire changed my life. This show changed my life. It's impossible to put into words but the simplest thing to say to you all ... THANK YOU.\"\nHeughan also shared a farewell post to the platform, posting a variety of behind-the-scenes photos and writing: \"Hard to say goodbye to this character... our crew, that have become our family, our friends. That's a wrap on pick ups, reshoots and the final drive home with @daviehollywood. Thank you to everyone that made @outlander_starz possible, @diana_gabaldon and to the fans.\"\nHe finished his post with the quote from the show: \"Nothing is lost Sassenach, only changed.\"\nWhile Outlander fans might be sad to know the show is coming to its conclusion, it is actually not going to be the end, as Starz has greenlit a prequel titled Blood of My Blood.\nThe new show will focus on the love story between Jamie's parents, Ellen MacKenzie and Brian Fraser, and as such it will also feature a number of characters that fans of the original will recognize.\nMatthew B. Roberts will act as writer, showrunner and executive producer on the show, and its first season has been given a 10-episode order, with Gabaldon returning as a consulting producer on the show.\nIn a statement, Roberts said: \"Outlander: Blood of My Blood is, at its heart, a love story. It will explore what lengths a person will go to find love in a time when love is considered a luxury, and when marriages are made strategically, often for political or financial gain.\n\"The title is a nod to Jamie Fraser's marriage vow to Claire and there will be several names and faces that Outlander fans will know and recognize.\"\nHe added: \"Jamie and Claire's TV story may be coming to an end with Season 8, but Diana is continuing on with their literary journey in her wonderful book series and is working diligently on Book 10.\n\"With Jamie and Claire, and now Brian and Ellen, there is still so much more to come in the Outlander universe, and we cannot wait to continue sharing these stories with our dedicated fans.\"\n",

    "content": "A woman expecting her first child got thinking about DNA, and sparked major debate with one simple question.\nBrianna Donovan, 28 and from Boston, Massachusetts, took to her TikTok account @brianna.donovan on August 29, and asked: \"Are you more related to your siblings or your children?\"\n\"I had just found out I was pregnant and was thinking about the resemblance between me and my siblings and it made me wonder who I will be more related to,\" she told Newsweek.\nIn the clip taken in her car, which she captioned \"useless thoughts by me,\" she mused: \"With your siblings, you have the exact same parents, and then your children, they have your DNA. But they also have your husband's DNA, who you're not related to.\"\nShe said she had been thinking a lot about this, because it seems like you should be more related to your own child—\"but don't you share more DNA with your siblings?\"\nHer video went viral, with almost 400,000 views and hundreds of comments—and nobody could agree on the answer. One wrote: \"Siblings are our closest biological relatives.\"\nBut another insisted: \"Your child. They have 50 percent of your DNA.\"\nAnother TikTok user joked she would now be referring to her child as \"my half daughter,\" while one shared that she was an identical twin, so she was guaranteed to be more closely related to her sister.\n\"I think it's really funny that no one seems to know the answer,\" Donovan said.\nNewsweek reached out to experts on the viral question. Dr. Adelheid Lempradl, an assistant professor at the Van Andel Institute in Grand Rapids, Michigan, said that despite the apparent simplicity of what Donovan had asked it was \"actually a very complicated question.\"\n\"Relationship on the DNA level to children and siblings is about the same,\" she explained. \"You share 50 percent of your DNA with your siblings and your children.\"\nBut Lempradl, whose area of expertise includes epigenetics and intergenerational inheritance, said siblings could inherit different \"alleles\"—alternate versions of a gene—leading to \"variations in traits and genetic predispositions.\"\nA child, however, will always receive the \"same specific half of the parent's genome.\"\nWhile a person will share between 40 percent and 60 percent of DNA with their siblings, \"only about 25 percent of the total DNA is identical,\" Lempradl said, while \"about 25 percent are half-identical, where siblings inherit different versions of the same location on a chromosome from a parent.\"\nShe gave an example of \"one sibling gets the father's chromosome 1a while the other gets chromosome 1b.\"\n\"On average,\" she added, \"about 25 percent of their DNA falls into this category.\"\nResearch into DNA has flourished since the molecule was first identified in the 1860s by Swiss chemist Johann Friedrich Miescher. He had been researching the makeup of white blood cells when he discovered what he first called a \"nuclein,\" initially believing it to have come from the cell nucleus of a white blood cell, according to Your Genome.\nAlmost 100 years later, in 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick first described the physical structure of DNA, including the discovery that DNA can be copied when cells divide.\nDo you have funny and adorable videos or pictures you want to share?

But his wealth is also due to government contracts and programs that affected his two main businesses – electric vehicles and space travel.\nNow President-elect Donald Trump has tasked the Tesla and SpaceX CEO with eliminating waste from the federal government. In the new role, Musk will help direct policies on a wide range of issues and government bodies, including those that regulate his many business interests.\nFor example, Musk and Trump watched SpaceX’s launch Tuesday night of the rocket that could someday take people back to the moon and even to Mars. The amount the US commits to those efforts will greatly affect SpaceX’s financial success.\nIt’s worthwhile to ask just how much of his world-leading net worth comes from government help over the last 10 to 15 years. The answer is not simple.\nBy some measures, little of his wealth is thanks to taxpayers. Musk is worth an estimated $326 billion, according to Bloomberg’s real-time billionaire tracker. His companies have received “only” tens of billions from government contracts and programs.\nBut in other ways, virtually all of his net worth can be pinned to government help. Tesla and SpaceX got started – and survived their early days﻿ – with assistance from state and federal policies, government contracts and loans.\n“The foundation for Musk’s financial success has been the US government,” said Daniel Ives, tech analyst for Wedbush Securities.\nAnd the value of Tesla and SpaceX doesn’t come from their profits so far.\nInstead, their value comes from investments in their future worth, such as Tesla’s publicly traded stock and private funding rounds for SpaceX.\nSince Trump’s election, Musk’s net worth has increased $64 billion, or nearly 25%, according to Bloomberg’s estimate. This is partly based on the assumption that future growth will be easier with Musk offering advice on topics including artificial intelligence, self-driving vehicles and funding for agencies that have given his companies regulatory trouble.\nTesla has received relatively modest government contracts in the past. But it got a lot of help getting started, critical help.\nIn January 2010, Tesla was starting out and had sold less than 2,000 cars in its history. Then the company received a $465 million low-interest loan from the Department of Energy, months before its initial public offering. With the loan, it developed its Model S car, its first major success, and paid back the loan early through proceeds from an additional sale of stock in 2013.\nAs Tesla started to sell cars, a $7,500 tax credit for EV buyers allowed the company  and other automakers to sell American-made EVs at a higher price than the market might‘ve allowed otherwise.\nTesla buyers received federal tax credits worth an estimated $3.4 billion before the perk disappeared entirely for Tesla buyers at the end of 2019. Even if that only allowed Tesla to raise prices by half that amount, that’s another $1.7 billion in federal help when the company was facing a cash crunch.\nThe tax credit was restored in 2023 as part of the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. But Musk has encouraged the incoming Trump administration to end the $7,500 tax credit, which would seem to be against Tesla’s interests but would be a blow for established automakers seeking to get a share of the US EV market. Those legacy automakers would have to accept bigger losses on their EV sales or pull back on offerings, which would reduce competition for Tesla.\n“Take away the subsidies, it will only help Tesla,” Musk posted on his social media platform X in July.\nBut Tesla’s most significant financial support is not from tax credits for EV buyers. It comes from the sale of regulatory credits that other automakers buy to comply with state and federal regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gases.\nThe money doesn’t come from taxpayers. But without the government regulation, there would be no billions flowing into Tesla’s coffers, and straight to its billion lines.\nThose credit sales literally kept Tesla’s lights on, and its paychecks being cashed, in the company’s early days. They accounted for nearly 25% of its revenue in 2008 and 10% of its revenue over the course of the next five years.\nBetween 2008 and 2019, sales of regulatory credits generated more than $2 billion for the company.\nTesla might have died without those funds. Don’t take our word for it. Ask Musk himself.\nIn a tweet in 2020, Musk admitted that Tesla was nearly forced to file for bankruptcy as recently at 2019. The stock price had been floundering as the company had difficulty ramping up production of its Model 3 sedan.\n“Closest we got (to bankruptcy) was about a month,” he said in the tweet. “The Model 3 ramp was extreme stress & pain for a long time — from mid 2017 to mid 2019. Production & logistics hell.”\nEven when the threat of bankruptcy lessened, it wasn’t until 2021 that the company was able to post a profit without the help of credit sales.\nIn Tesla’s history, sales of regulatory credits have brought in nearly $11 billion, with all of it falling pretty much directly to its bottom line.\n“If it didn’t have regulatory credits, Tesla would not be the brand it is around the globe and Musk wouldn’t be the richest person in the world,” said Ives, who is a bull on Tesla shares today. In 2019, he was still skeptical.\nEven without his shares and options in Tesla Musk would still likely be worth more than $100 billion and one of the richest people on the planet. SpaceX will likely be valued at about $250 billion in an upcoming round of funding from investors, Reuters said. Ives said while SpaceX has not disclosed Musk’s holdings, his estimate is close to 50%.\nTaxpayer support for SpaceX comes from direct government contracts that are worth billions.\nAccording to USASpending.gov, the government database that tracks federal spending, SpaceX has signed contracts worth nearly $20 billion. The most crucial one came just before Christmas in 2008, when SpaceX and Musk were both virtually out of cash.\nThat contract was worth $1.6 billion and involved flying 12 supply missions to the International Space Station. The deal allowed SpaceX to complete the Falcon 9 rocket, its main workhorse, and the Dragon capsule, said Casey Dreier, senior space policy advisory for the Planetary Society, a public interest group advocating space flight.\n“They were right on the edge of insolvency,” Dreier said. “Elon has pointed out at that moment they were on the edge, and that helped to save the company.”\nDreier said the ISS deal and other contracts have allowed NASA to transport US astronauts without relying on Russia.\nSpaceX has since gotten numerous additional contracts from NASA, the military and other US government agencies. It won a $3 billion contract to develop the next vehicle to carry astronauts to the moon. And Dreier said the company and other NASA contractors benefit from access to the agency’s employees and expertise.\nIves said that if the Trump administration increases funding for NASA’s efforts to return to the moon and travel to Mars, SpaceX’s value could easily increase to $500 billion or more.\n“The $250 billion estimate is pretty conservative,” he said.\nCNN’s Jackie Wattles contributed to this report\n",

    "content": "Coffee drinking seems to alter which microorganisms live in our guts, with potentially far-reaching implications for health, a large study has found.\nBacteria, yeasts and fungi collectively referred to as the gut microbiome—are important for digestion, nutrient absorption, toilet habits, mental health, immunity and more.\nEveryone's gut microbiome is unique, with varying amounts of different types of microorganisms, and scientists believe it changes depending on our diets, environments and the guts of people in our lives.\nProfessor Dr. Tim Spector, scientific cofounder of ZOE and one of the study's authors, told Newsweek that the study's findings \"further the idea that there's a specific link between the food we eat and the microbes in our gut—meaning we hold immense power to improve our health through the food choices we make.\n\"This novel finding shows just how insightful gut microbiome data can be in helping us to accurately decode people's diets; a crucial step in helping people to improve their diet and gut health, by feeding their microbes what they love.\"\nScientists at ZOE, the nutrition science company which conducted the study, chose to focus on coffee to investigate the relationship between our diets and our gut microbiomes.\nThey wrote in their study, published on Monday in scientific journal Nature Microbiology, that they chose coffee because it is widely consumed, it seems to have health benefits—for example, lowering the risk of dying from heart disease, the risk of type 2 diabetes, the risk of certain cancers, and more—and because people tend to either consume coffee regularly, or not at all, unlike other foods and drinks.\n\"Coffee's health benefits are likely thanks to its complex chemical nature,\" said Spector. \"Made by fermenting beans, coffee contains hundreds of compounds that are present in both caffeinated and decaf coffee.\n\"These include a range of polyphenols, which fuel the gut microbiome and can help reduce blood sugar and blood pressure.\"\nPrevious research by the same scientists had found that, out of 150 different foods, coffee seemed to most strongly linked to the composition of the gut microbiome.\nThe scientists conducted their research using data from 22,800 people in the U.S. and U.K., who submitted detailed dietary information, and public data from another 54,200 people in 211 other cohorts.\nThey also analyzed more than 400 samples of plasma and more than 350 fecal samples, and conducted two in-vitro experiments, to investigate how coffee might impact a person's gut.\nThey found that one strain of bacteria, called Lawsonibacter asaccharolyticus, was strongly associated with coffee drinking. People who drank more than three cups of coffee per day had up to eightfold higher levels of this bacteria in their guts, compared to people who drank fewer than three cups of coffee per month.\nAmong people who drank coffee regularly, those who drank more coffee seemed to have more L. asaccharolyticus too—although there was more of a difference between coffee drinkers and nondrinkers.\nThe relationship was remarkably consistent across populations of people in 25 different countries, the scientists found—and, when they fed L. asaccharolyticus coffee in a test tube, the bacteria grew.\n\"This study highlights just how fussy our microbes can be,\" said Spector. \"This Lawsonibacter microbe hangs around in suspended animation, just waiting for a cup of coffee in order to flourish.\n\"This gives us novel insights into how we need great diversity in plants to properly feed all our gut microbes and reap the health benefits.\"\nThe scientists speculated that this strain of bacteria might be a key reason why coffee is associated with so many benefits, as these bacteria can turn components in the coffee into other more beneficial compounds, with further health benefits.\n\"At the moment, we don't know how this microbe impacts our health, though it may be involved in positive health impacts we can thank coffee for,\" said Spector. \"This is the tip of the iceberg and shows how, with the massive sample size of ZOE's database, we can unlock many more food microbe connections, informing us how to eat for better health.\"\nIn conclusion, the scientists wrote, their research provided an insight into how the foods we eat influence the gut microbes we have and the health benefits we get from those foods.\nDo you have a tip on a food story that Newsweek should be covering?

    "content": "An alleged Iranian plot to kill a Jewish former politician has been foiled by Canadian security services before it came to fruition, according to The Globe and Mail newspaper.\nIrwin Cotler, 84, a Canadian human-rights advocate and former justice minister who also served as attorney general, said he was the subject of an alleged assassination plot by two suspected Iranian agents.\nHaving been warned of the alleged plot by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on October 26, Cotler was placed under its protection. He had previously been under surveillance following the October 7 Hamas attack in Israel after the Canadian Security Intelligence Service named him as a high-profile target of Iran.\nNewsweek reached out to Canada's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Global Affairs Canada for comment via email outside of business hours.\nNewsweek has also reached out to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the Islamic Republic of Iran for comment via email.\nCotler had previously been critical of the Iranian regime for its actions in the 2020 downing of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, in which all 176 people onboard were killed, as well as the country's funding of the militant group Hamas.\nIran said that its military accidentally shot down the flight leaving Tehran for Kyiv as it thought it was a \"hostile target\" after the aircraft flew toward a \"sensitive military center\" of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).\nCotler has been known to Iran since he began his 2008 campaign to list the state army, the IRGC, as a terrorist entity, which Canada and the U.S. later enacted.\nIn response to the alleged assassination plot, Cotler said, \"We hold the regime accountable and send the message that we will not be intimidated, that we will not be silenced.\"\nHe added, \"We are really dealing with a collective danger to our human security and, regrettably, Iran has been able to carry this out amidst a culture of impunity.\"\nCotler also said that he believes Iran has become a \"case study of what today is the phenomenon not only of transnational repression, but transnational assassination\" and that it is now a \"leading state actor in that particular assault on our national security and sovereignty.\"\nThe former justice minister was also contacted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding the unsealing of an indictment in the U.S. pertaining to another alleged Iranian murder-for-hire plot targeting President-elect Donald Trump and others in the U.S. The Iranian government has denied the allegations.\nThe FBI contacted Cotler as his name came up during an investigation, although he was not listed as one of the targets.\nA lawyer as well as politician, Cotler served as Canada's first special envoy on Holocaust remembrance and combating antisemitism from 2020 to 2023. He founded the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights in 2015, which advocates for political prisoners and fighting global injustice.\n",

    "content": "This is so easy to write and yet so terribly difficult.\nEasy, because every grieving parent is most likely thinking of their child who died most if not all day.\nSo hard, because we know we speak our own language and that so many people, despite how well-intentioned, might think my thoughts strange or surprising.\nAdd to this that Nick was 34 years of age, not a child, and you get that extra layer of not understanding a loss after six years.\nI have had \"anticipatory\" grief ever since Nick was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, meaning insulin requiring, at age eight.\nAs an internal medicine doc, I tried to stay so hard in the \"dad lane,\" but the moment that the young doctor told Nick and me that it was \"diabetes\", I began crying uncontrollably. I was worried about the finger sticks, the diet and, most of all, his life expectancy.\nHis mom was so much better at the adjustment required than his overeducated dad. His mom was able to do what was required all the while with a loving and sensitive demeanor.\nAfter about six to eight weeks of diabetes management, Nick magically said to us: \"I tried it and I don't like it. I don't want to have diabetes anymore.\"\nThat broke my heart and I was almost grateful for the magical thinking that an eight-year-old can employ. It was at night, upstairs, and I remember exactly where I was standing when Nick spoke those words.\nA year goes by and his five-year-old little sister, Rachel, develops Type 1 also. I went out into the driveway and cursed God, and then begged God to give me something awful so that Nick and Rachel would be spared.\nI still wish that there were a trading store somewhere where folks better equipped for an illness can accept the burden from one of their family, like donating a kidney or being a match for bone marrow. Think how busy that \"trading store\" would be because of the willingness of parents to sacrifice for their children.\nBut as Rabbi Kushner put it in 1981, suffering is not evenly distributed and sometimes bad things happen to good people, or certainly innocent ones, like children.\nWe were fortunate to be at Duke, where there was an entire division of pediatric endocrinologists. And we were fortunate that Rachel's diabetes from the get-go was a bit more manageable than Nick's labile journey.\nI still bristle when a well-intentioned person asks me if Nick had been a \"good diabetic\".\nAgain, alluding to Kushner's book, When Bad Things Happen to Good People, people try to make sense of the world and one way to do that is to believe that whatever happens to a child, they somehow deserved it.\nPlease understand and share that Type 1 is a disease and not a moral flaw. And that the genetic underpinnings are becoming better and better known. And Nick's disease was always so much more labile and difficult to manage.\nProbably because of Nick, we diagnosed Rachel's Type 1 without an episode of diabetic ketoacidosis, and we were much more calm and better managers of Rachel's journey than Nick's.\nI don't know for sure that he ever appreciated what he did for Rachel and us in that regard. And I hope somehow he can feel our love. What parent does not want or wish that?\nNick died in September 2018, at the age of 34. We recently acknowledged and honored his anniversary.\nHe died of diabetic ketoacidosis following a viral illness that caused nausea and vomiting and sent him into ketosis—a condition that can make our blood acidic and even stop the heart.\nBeing a middle child, a Greek, and a doctor, I made up the word \"gruilt\" to help me absorb the blow of his death.\nGruilt is 80 percent pure, white-boned grief, with 10-20 percent of guilt. Reading the \"parental grief \"academic literature, you will find the word \"guilt\" in the title of many published articles.\nIt has been six years, and I still go over the tape and ask myself what I could have done differently.\nIn the early days of \"acute grief\", my nerves were out on my skin, and I cried daily—almost always alone. This resulted in eating too much, the Greek response to stress, and a sleep disturbance that has been recalcitrant to all kinds of interventions.\nI read one article where the dads had sleep problems out to nine years after their child died, and we don't know how much longer that goes on because that was the end of the study.\nWhich brings me to the most important point: There is no timetable, there is no time that a parent will \"get over\" the death or will \"move on\". There is a time, in fact, when a parent can learn to accommodate the loss, not accept it, and return to work and social relationships.\nBut there is NOT a time when we should expect someone to forget their child died or endorse the sentiment of \"shouldn't you be over this by now?\"\nI think most grieving parents could write a book, if not several articles, on what NOT to say to a grieving parent. This is not part of medical, nursing, or PA schools, so I hope my friends in the mental health fields are learning this as part of their curricula. I have my doubts.\nNot all stories have to have a happy ending, and not all sadness has to have meaning. The wonderful writer Megan Devine has written that \"... acknowledgment is the only real medicine for grief\" and we cannot fix the unfixable.\nSo, I have learned to carry my grief, Nick's mom and sister carry their grief in their own way, too.\nMy morning prayers always include peace on earth, blessings upon both children and at the conclusion: \"I pray for the strength to carry my grief and to teach grief to others.\"\nI am still Nick's dad, and we parents are still the parents of the children who died. And as long as we love our children, we will grieve them.\nGrieve well, my fellow parents.\nAnthony N. Galanos MD is a professor of medicine at Duke University.\nAll views expressed are the author's own.\nThis essay was produced in partnership with Evermore, a national nonpartisan nonprofit dedicated to making the world a more livable place for all bereaved people.\nDo you have a unique experience or personal story to share?

    "content": "For travel tips, recipes and more insight on Italian culture, sign up for CNN’s Unlocking Italy newsletter. This eight-part guide will have you packing your bags in no time.\nThere’s nothing quite like the mouthwatering taste of real Prosciutto di Parma, known the world over as Parma ham.\nThe Italian delicacy, which generates an annual turnover of $1.6 billion, is prized by Italians and enjoys a protected status — only meat cured in the northern region of Emilia Romagna using just Italian-grown pork legs, salt and air can be certified as authentic by the Parma Ham Consortium.\nTourists regularly flock to the region, known for other epicurean delights like balsamic vinegar and Parmesan cheese, to savor the tastiest cuts in their place of origin, bringing in more income as they join guided tours of ham producers.\nBut all is not well in ham country. A warming climate and the spread of viruses affecting the pigs are causing big problems for Italian pork. The end result is that Parma ham as we know it is increasingly hard to find on international dinner plates.\nUnlike many heavily mechanized meat processing industries, Parma ham production is steeped in history and tradition.\nIn factories like the Slega prosciuttificio, in the hamlet of Langhirano near the city of Parma, Stefano Borchini remembers his father teaching him methods of curing Parma ham that date back to Roman times, when local salt was used to preserve the meat.\nThe Italian-grown pig’s hind leg is carefully butchered and then salted by a maestro salatore, or salt master, and then left for about a week in a cooling room to begin a process that must take at least 400 days and can be cured for up to three years to create the finest aged Parma ham.\nRelated article\nExtra virgin olive oil is getting very expensive. And it might not even be real\nParma ham is salted twice, grease-sealed with a lard and salt mixture, and then left to cure in climate-controlled rooms. When possible, curing room windows are left open to let in the clean local air.\n“My father founded this company, and my first job in the factory was to swat the flies when I was six years old,” Borchini says. “You have a passion for this product, like a wine producer, it’s the same. When you produce food, it’s special. You put your heart in what you do.”\nEach of the 40,000 to 50,000 legs of ham the company produces each year is cured the same exact way, and tested for quality with a needle made from horse bone. The needle is stuck into the curing ham in several places and pulled out to check the smell to ensure food safety.\nBorchini explains the final phases of the curing process are fine tuned by opening and closing windows to let in the fresh air on cool nights, just the way his father taught him to do. “Meat, salt, time and air is what it takes,” he says.\nThe process — and the product — draws hundreds of thousands of foodies and curious visitors from all over the world to the area each year to take food tours. Up and down the streets of Parma and little hamlets like Langhirano, small tour groups taste the delicacies, often in conjunction with the area’s other delicacies including Parmiggiano Reggiano (or Parmesan cheese), balsamic vinegar from Modena and local wine.\nBut lately, threats like manmade climate change and diseases like African swine fever have challenged the ham industry.\nBorchini says that a few years ago his business had to install air conditioning systems in the curing rooms because the air doesn’t cool down like it used to.\n“We no longer have the fresh cool nights during the summer that we had before, but we are lucky that we can continue,” he says. “It has changed by one or two degrees warmer at night than 15 years ago, which means we have had to adjust.”\nRelated article\nFrance’s favorite cheese is facing an ‘extinction’ crisis. Not everyone is worried\nAfrican swine fever, a highly contagious disease that can be fatal to pigs, has also had an impact on production. Although not a danger to humans, the virus can be spread by people, including through the consumption of infected meat. That’s led to strict controls in Italy and beyond.\nBorchini says there’s been a reduction in pork legs of around 8%, and a drastic hike in costs, as a consequence.\n“We are finding that there are just not as many fresh pork legs to meet our needs because of restrictions and controls,” he says. “We have difficulties in raw materials and the price has increased because there is less pork than usual. The supply is less than the demand, and the price has risen.”\nAround 80 miles north of Parma, near Brescia in the northern region of Lombardy, the air is very different.\nOn Alberto Cavagnini’s farm, the atmosphere is heavy with the strong scent of pigs. But they are nowhere to be seen, essentially kept under lockdown to protect them from the swine fever virus. Cavagnini produces pork for products including Parma ham and San Daniele ham — a similar cured meat originating in Italy’s northeastern Friuli region. These are exported all over the world.\nCavagnini has had to cull more than 2,000 of his animals after the virus, thought to have been introduced by wild boar, was detected in one of his pig barns earlier this year. The government, which has appointed a special commissioner to help manage the crisis, requires the destruction of all animals on farms where the virus has been detected.\n“It’s obligatory to destroy the animals because the virus is so contagious,” he says. Workers take strict safety measures, including showering before they are in contact with his pigs, to avoid accidental spread of the virus, which is not airborne but easily carried on shoes or clothing.\n“There is no option but to put down the infected animals because 95% of the animals will die in a painful way,” he says.\nRelated article\nItalian food: Classic dishes everyone needs to try\nIn all, more than 200,000 pigs have been killed in the region of Lombardy since the virus was detected in 2021 and nearly 90,000 in the last two months.\nThe situation is slowly coming under control, but for some pork producers it’s too late.\nAlmost a dozen pig farms have had to close in Italy since the virus outbreak. It has also been devastating for producers who rely on international markets, since European Union regulations ban pork exports from regions in the swine fever “red zone.”\nDavide Calderone, head of the Assisca association of Italy’s meat and cured meat producers, says the Italian pork industry, which extends to sausages, mortadella and salami, has an annual turnover of around $9 billion. Were it not for the virus, exports should be accounting for $2 billion.\nIn the last year, several countries have all banned Italian pork exports.\n“China, Japan, Taiwan have completely closed the market because of African swine fever,” Calderone says. “Other countries, for example Canada, the United States, Brazil recognize the European system with regionalization bans depending on where the virus has been detected.”\nCalderone says Italy has been able to maintain pork exports to many countries with some limitations. “We are trying to convince them about the system, about the safety, and the animal health of our products,” he says.\nBack in Parma, there is no convincing necessary. A steady flow of food tourists stream in and out of the delis and showrooms to savor the ancient delicacy, perhaps unaware of the challenges behind producing each scrumptious leg of ham but clearly grateful for the experience.\n",

    "content": "Rien Schuurhuis never expected to win this year’s cycling world championships, nor come close to claiming the race’s distinctive rainbow jersey. For the sole representative of the Vatican City in the 200-strong field, simply being at the race in Switzerland was enough.\n“If you just do cycling for winning, then most cyclists will be very miserable,” Schuurhuis tells CNN Sport. “A lot of riders, not only me, know before they start that they’re not going to win.”\nThis year’s world championships marked the latest and perhaps final chapter of Schuurhuis’ sporting odyssey with the Vatican, one that has seen him become the first cyclist to compete for the tiny city-state at an elite level.\nSince 2022 – soon after the International Cycling Union (UCI), cycling’s global governing body, recognized the Vatican as a member – the Dutch-born rider has appeared at three world championships as well as September’s European Championships in Belgium, on each occasion proudly wearing his team’s yellow and white jersey.\nCovering about 100 acres and with a population of 1,000 people, the Vatican is an unlikely presence at some of cycling’s biggest annual races. Yet over the years, Schuurhuis has assembled a small but vocal fan club.\nRelated article\nHeadwinds, hunger and ‘a very close call’ with a kangaroo: Lachlan Morton sets fastest time cycling around Australia\n“There was one hill in the (2022) world championships and everyone was yelling: ‘The Pope’s cyclist! The Vatican!’ So they all knew about me,” he says. “What I’ve now seen in Switzerland a few weeks ago, there’s even these supporter groups that have a flag of the Vatican and my name written on there.”\nWith winning a major title out of the question – Schuurhuis has been unable to finish a world championship race, such is the brutal nature of the competition – the focus is instead on spreading a message of inclusion and fraternity.\nAthletica Vaticana – the Vatican’s first official sports association – was established in 2019, and Pope Francis soon earmarked cycling as a vehicle to promote unity, observing how teamwork in the peloton upholds “a spirit of selflessness, generosity and community in order to help those who have fallen behind.”\nGiven this mission statement, there is perhaps an irony in Schuurhuis being the only representative for the Vatican in major races. But the 42-year-old does have support from a small management team, which includes former professional cyclist Valerio Agnoli.\nAt every race, Schuurhuis’ ultimate aim has been to get people talking about the team and what it represents.\n“If you’re in a breakaway in the early stages of the race,” he says, “you get a bit of exposure and that was a moment for, I guess, journalists and television and radio to talk about the goal we are there for. And that helps.”\nA keen cyclist and soccer player in his youth, Schuurhuis’ first taste of high-level sport came when he played in the I-League, the second tier of professional soccer in India. A move to Australia followed, and from there his focus switched to cycling, competing for semi-professional teams around Asia.\nHis family moved to Rome when his wife, Chiara Porro, was appointed as Australia’s Embassy to the Holy See in 2020, offering an avenue for him to compete for the Vatican on the international stage.\nHerself a keen athlete, Porro has also been involved in the state’s sporting projects, taking part in a relay race three years ago alongside teams of refugees, prison inmates and people with disabilities.\nShe describes Athletica Vaticana as “well developed” with priests, bishops, religious sisters, lay people, Swiss Guards and diplomats making up its members.\n“(Sport) is such a leveler, it overcomes all sorts of barriers,” Porro tells CNN. “I think it’s about highlighting sport as another avenue for creating community cohesion, social cohesion, peacebuilding and development. It’s an avenue, like education and culture, for achieving other objectives which are much needed at the moment.”\nThe Vatican’s link with sport isn’t just limited to the past five years. The sportiest pope of recent decades was Pope John Paul II (1979-2005), a keen skier and swimmer who continued to hit the slopes after his election and even built an Olympic swimming pool in the papal summer residence of Castel Gandolfo.\nPope Francis, the first Latin American pontiff, is a soccer fan who played as a goalkeeper and supported San Lorenzo while growing up in Argentina. He once joked with Argentinian legend Diego Maradona – described by Pope Francis as a “poet” on the field – about the infamous “hand of God” goal in the 1986 World Cup quarterfinal against England.\n“I asked him, jokingly, ‘So, which is the guilty hand?’” he wrote in a recently published memoir.\nDuring Pope Francis’ pontificate, the Vatican’s engagement with the world of sport has ramped up significantly. As well as the establishment of Athletica Vaticana, the Dicastery for Culture and Education acts as a “ministry for sport” equivalent.\n“Athletica Vaticana … has traveled its first leg at full speed, in a whirlwind of sports, solidarity and spiritual initiatives,” Giampaolo Mattei, the President of Athletica Vaticana, told CNN Sport. “On many occasions, Pope Francis has met and had words of encouragement and direction for ‘his’ team … calling himself the ‘coach of the heart’ of Vatican Athletica.”\nAs for Porro, who at 40 is one of the youngest ambassadors serving in the Vatican, she hopes that the Vatican might one day take part in the Olympics, pointing to the 2032 Brisbane Games in Australia as something to aim for.\nAfter four years in Rome, her posting at the Vatican is due to finish at the end of the month, and she and Schuurhuis will return to Canberra, Australia, with their two children. Though the move will spell an end to Schuurhuis’ time competing for the Vatican, he is confident that he will keep pursuing cycling, his love for the sport stronger than ever before.\n“This is who I am, this is what makes me happy,” he says. “Usually, it’s the best moment of the day, going out for a ride and feeling energized the whole day after.”\n",

    "content": "A major decision by the United States to allow Ukraine to fire long-range missiles deeper inside Russian territory has complicated a potential western diplomatic thaw with Russia as dozens of world leaders gather this week.\nSunday’s decision was viewed by many western leaders as a way to position Ukraine for success ahead of a change in American leadership, with the incoming president skeptical of continued US assistance.\nBut it also complicated the diplomatic dance leaders attending the G20 summit must partake in as they navigate the complex geopolitical dynamics of the bloc.\nRussia “will perceive launches of long-range missiles guided by US military experts as a qualitatively new phase of war by the West,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said during a news conference at the summit, according to Russian state media TASS.\nLavrov attended the G20 in place of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who faced questions about whether he could be arrested for war crimes on international soil. Days after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on Brazilian authorities to arrest Putin, the Russian leader said he would skip the summit to avoid disrupting it.\nAmid the change in strategy – which Biden had deliberated over for months – the president and his team steered clear of Lavrov on the ground in Rio.\nWhen Biden missed a photo with other leaders on Monday, speculation abounded that he was trying to avoid being photographed with Lavrov. The White House denied that, citing a logistical snafu.\nStill, neither Biden nor his delegation held talks with Lavrov or his team, US officials said. And Biden and Lavrov’s fluid schedules meant that they were not photographed together with other world leaders.\nBut some Western allies, sensing a sea change in the US approach to the conflict once Donald Trump takes office, appear to be weighing a shift in their own stance toward Moscow.\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz spoke to Putin by phone the week before the summit. In his remarks at the close of the summit, Lavrov also hailed the German government’s refusal to send Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine as a “responsible stance,” TASS reported.\nAnd onsite in Rio, French President Emmanuel Macron could be seen shaking the hand of Lavrov, standing in the row behind him during a “family photo” of attendees.\nIn Rio, the pending Trump presidency shadowed nearly every discussion of the Ukraine conflict. Leaders here are acutely aware of Trump’s views toward the war, but are less certain of how that will manifest in policy once he takes office.\nIt’s not clear, for example, whether Trump would uphold Biden’s decision on allowing Ukraine the long-range capability, a step that NATO leaders had been encouraging for months. Trump’s incoming national security adviser, Florida Rep. Mike Waltz, questioned the decision in an interview Monday.\n“It’s another step up the escalation ladder and nobody knows where this is going,” he said on Fox News, adding he hadn’t been given a heads up by the outgoing administration about the change in policy.\nOfficials in Rio declined to say whether Biden had raised the issue of the missiles with Trump during their two-hour meeting in the Oval Office last week.\n“The two presidents discussed a wide range of issues. We’ve been pretty careful not to read that conversation out in any detail. Certainly, the conversation included all of the major issues of geopolitical significance, but I’m not going to get into the details of it,” deputy national security adviser Jon Finer said.\nThere had been hope among western officials of a strong statement denouncing Russia’s invasion at the conclusion of the summit. In particular, European diplomats made a late-stage push to strengthen the language following Russia’s massive drone and missile attack on Sunday, according to people familiar with the talks.\nUltimately, the effort was dropped when it appeared other countries were not on board. The language in the final leaders statement was watered down from previous years, including broad references to “human suffering” and “negative added impacts of the war” without explicit condemnation of Russia.\nThe Ukraine war generated only one paragraph in the final document, compared to several that were included in the final document produced by the G20 last year in New Delhi — which itself was watered down from the previous year.\nAs the summit was concluding, it was evident that tensions between the US and Russia were only ratcheting up. Russia announced as the second day of the summit was getting underway that it would update its nuclear doctrine to consider aggression from any non-nuclear state – but with the participation of a nuclear country – a joint attack on Moscow.\nAmerican officials were unsurprised to learn Moscow had updated its nuclear doctrine following Biden’s decision on long-range missiles.\n“Russia had been signaling its intent to update its doctrine for several weeks,” a US official said in response to the doctrine update, adding that so far the US has not observed any updates to Russia’s nuclear posture — and thus see no reason to change the US stance.\n“This is more of the same irresponsible rhetoric from Russia, which we have seen for the past two years,” the official said.\nIn his closing remarks, Lavrov sought to downplay the change in the fine print on its nuclear posture – shifting blame instead to the West.\n“The update of the military doctrine does not add anything which would be different… from the American doctrine or documents on what to do with nuclear weapons,” according to Russian state media.\n",

    "content": "Cambridge Dictionary has put it out to the universe, naming “manifest” as its word of the year for 2024.\nPopularized by celebrities such as singer Dua Lipa, “manifest” refers to the practice of using “methods such as visualization and affirmation to help you imagine achieving something you want, in the belief that doing so will make it more likely to happen,” the British dictionary publisher said in an announcement Wednesday.\nLipa has spoken about how she thinks manifestation has played a part in her success, helping to bring about key moments in her career, such as playing at the Glastonbury Festival this year.\nRelated article\n‘Founder mode’ is the latest Silicon Valley buzzword telling toxic bosses they’re great\n“If you set an intention and you think about it every single day of your life, and for me, Glastonbury for example, when I first started making music I dreamed about the day that I would get asked to headline Glastonbury,” she said in an interview in April.\n“And I’ve probably thought about it every single session that I’m in the studio, because when I write a song I think I go ‘oh what’s this going to sound like at Glastonbury?’” Lipa said.\n“That in a way is setting that idea, that intention in the back of my mind,” she added. “I think it’s powerful.”\nUS Olympic gymnast Simone Biles has also mentioned her use of manifestation after her mother started encouraging her to write down her goals.\n“You have to write it down, you have to speak it into existence, you have to see it daily and then it usually happens,” she said in an interview in October.\nTaken from Latin and French, in English the word “manifest” originally meant “easily noticed or obvious” before it started to be used as a verb meaning “to show something clearly.”\nIn the early 20th century it started to be used to mean “to make something happen by internalizing it, intentionally or unintentionally,” according to Cambridge Dictionary.\nRelated article\nCollins Dictionary’s word of the year is a confident, messy way of life\nThis year marked manifesting’s move into the wider public consciousness, it said.\n“In 2024, the word manifest jumped from being mainly used in the self-help community and on social media to being mentioned widely across mainstream media,” it wrote.\n“The use of this sense of manifest has gained in popularity with the increasing number of ‘manifesting influencers’ promoting this scientifically unproven practice on social media—so much so that it was added to the Cambridge Dictionary in May of 2023.”\nThe dictionary said the word has been looked up nearly 130,000 times on its website, becoming one of its most viewed entries.\nWendalyn Nichols, Cambridge Dictionary’s publishing manager, said the word of the year pick is based on “user data, zeitgeist and language.”\n“Manifest won this year because it increased notably in lookups, its use widened greatly across all types of media, and it shows how the meanings of a word can change over time,” said Nichols.\nOther words on the 2024 shortlist include “brat,” inspired by the title of singer Charli XCX’s 2024 album; “ecotarian,” which references the trend towards environmentally conscious living; and “resilience,” reflecting strength and adaptability.\nEarlier this month, Collins Dictionary named “brat” its word of the year, defining it as someone “characterized by a confident, independent, and hedonistic attitude.”\n",

    "content": "From the moment the US election results rolled in, climate leaders knew Donald Trump would be a blow to the COP29 talks in Baku. What they didn’t foresee was the demolition job Azerbaijan’s own leader would do from the inside.\nIn what should be one of the most urgent meetings of the year — aimed at slowing a global crisis fast spiraling out of control — the talks have descended into a circus of boycotts, political tirades and fossil fuels celebrations. Its host, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, has been its spectacular ringmaster.\nAmid the chaos, prominent global climate leaders on Friday issued an open letter calling for a “fundamental overhaul” of the entire UN climate process. It was originally published saying the annual talks, known as Conferences of the Parties (COPs), were “no longer fit for purpose,” but that language was quickly removed.\nA spokesperson for Sandrine Dixson-Declève, co-president of The Club of Rome — which published the letter — told CNN the edit was made because the authors’ “constructive criticism” had been seized upon by some parties to further their own interests at the talks, though she didn’t name any party in particular.\nBut the edit doesn’t change the idea that the talks are, indeed, losing their sense of credibility.\nRelated article\nIt’s not just Democrats — Republicans are working to Trump-proof their climate money\nCOP29 marks the third year in a row that the climate talks have been held in either a petrostate, or economy that relies heavily on oil and gas. The previous two were held in the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, and all three were criticized for alleged human rights abuses in the run-up to their events.\nAmong the open letter’s recommendations is to implement a “strict eligibility criteria to exclude countries who do not support the phase out/transition away from fossil energy” from holding COP presidencies.\nIncreasingly, the annual conferences have welcomed fossil fuel interests into the fold. This year, more than 1,700 fossil fuel lobbyists or industry players had been registered to attend the talks, according to an analysis by a coalition of groups called Kick Big Polluters Out.\nThis is a huge problem, said Alex Scott, a senior associate in climate diplomacy at the Italy-based think tank ECCO.\n“[Azerbaijan’s president] doesn’t sound like a guardian of the Paris Agreement. There’s still a week left for this presidency to show that they are fulfilling that role,” she told CNN from Baku. The 2015 Paris Agreement unites most of the world’s countries in a common goal to limit global warming.\n“But there are also 1,700 fossil fuel lobbyists walking the halls with us here,” she added, “and they’re also not guardians of the goals of the Paris Agreement.”\nOn Tuesday, Aliyev used his opening remarks at the talks to fend off criticism of Azerbaijan’s human rights record and defended its oil and gas riches as “a gift of the god,” in a speech that explicitly accused Western nations, NGOs and global media of “hypocrisy.”\nOn Wednesday, he again used his platform to launch a tirade against France and the Netherlands. Speaking to island states facing an existential threat of sea level rise, Aliyev accused both nations of a “brutal repression” of voices in what he called their “colonies,” in reference to overseas territories. He also blamed France for recent deadly unrest on the semi-autonomous island of New Caledonia.\nAliyev’s accusations were built around climate change arguments, but Baku has been at loggerheads with both France and the Netherlands over their stances on the Azerbaijan-Armenia territorial conflict.\nFrance’s ecology minister, Agnès Pannier-Runacher, was due to lead the French delegation but canceled her trip over the remarks.\nThe European Union’s foreign affairs chief, Joseph Borrell, chimed in on X, calling Aliyev’s allegations “regrettable.”\n“These unacceptable statements risk to undermine the conference’s vital climate objectives and the credibility of Azerbaijan’s COP29 presidency,” he wrote.\nThe geopolitical chaos comes as global climate leaders scramble to find ways to Trump-proof progress so far, as the president-elect has vowed to again pull the US out of the Paris Agreement.\nAlready the prospect of Trump is emboldening like-minded leaders to reconsider their own climate action. On Wednesday, Argentina’s foreign ministry pulled out its delegation from COP29 without giving any explanation. A source in President Javier Milei’s government later told CNN that Argentina was considering withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. Milei is a climate denier who has called global warming a “socialist hoax.”\nThe talks come on the heels of what is set to be the hottest year on record, and as back-to-back hurricanes killed more than 300 people in the US alone.\nSome scientists are questioning whether containing temperature rise to 1.5 degrees is still possible. To have any chance of doing so, carbon pollution must halve this decade and the world must reach net zero by mid century.\n",

    "content": "(CNN) - “I want to say to my babies that your mama loves you so much …” Susan Smith, then 23 years old, tearfully told the scrum of news cameras.\nIt was early November 1994, and Smith had recently told police her 3-year-old son Michael and 14-month-old son Alex were taken when she was carjacked by a Black man in the city of Union, South Carolina, in late October, setting off a manhunt and a barrage of media attention on the young mother.\n“You guys have got to be strong … I just know, I just feel in my heart that you guys are OK,” she said.\nBut it would turn out Smith’s young children were already dead – strapped in their car seats at the bottom of nearby John D. Long Lake, authorities said.\nInvestigators were skeptical of Smith’s story from the start, and eventually, under questioning, she confessed to rolling her car into the lake, killing her sons. The story made international headlines, and her 1995 murder trial was followed closely around the world.\nThe prosecution pointed to reports Smith was having an affair with her boss’ rich son who had just broken up with her because he didn’t want children. Her attorneys argued she was suicidal and depressed and intended to stay in the car with her children.\nSmith was convicted of murder. Now 53, she has served 30 years of her life sentence, making her eligible for parole under state law at the time of her trial.\nOn Wednesday, Smith will have her chance to make her argument before the parole board, according to the South Carolina Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services. Parole is only granted for violent offenders about 8% of the time, the department said.\nAs of the first week of November, the Office of Victim Services had received at least 360 letters, emails and messages about Smith’s parole hearing, with all but six opposing granting her parole, the department said.\nThe parole board makes decisions at its discretion, and parole may be granted within moments of the hearing’s conclusion Wednesday, or the board could wait until a later time or date, according to the department.\nSmith’s attorney, Tommy A. Thomas, did not respond to a request for comment.\nSmith’s three decades in prison haven’t been uneventful. She has faced a number of  internal disciplinary charges.\nJust months before her scheduled parole hearing, on August 16, Smith was charged with “communicating with a victim and/or witness” through telephone calls with a documentary filmmaker, according to the South Carolina Department of Corrections.\nInmates in South Carolina are allowed to receive and send letters but cannot legally communicate with journalists in person or on the phone. CNN has sent a letter to Smith in prison seeking comment – but has not received a response.\nSmith and the filmmaker discussed shooting the documentary after the parole hearing and how she would be paid for her participation, according to an incident report.\n“They also discussed in depth the crime and the events leading up to and after it actually took place,” the report states. “Including such details as to what was in the trunk of the car when it went into the water and her plans to jump from a bridge while holding the boys but one woke up.”\nThe department said Smith agreed to provide the filmmaker with contact information for friends, family and her former husband, David Smith. Money was then placed in her prison account, the department said. As a result, Smith lost her telephone, tablet and canteen privileges for 90 days, according to the department.\nSmith can apply for parole because the jury at her trial in 1995 declined to hand down the death penalty prosecutors had sought.\n“I thought the most stringent punishment we had would be the most appropriate punishment,” Tommy Pope, a former 16th Judicial Circuit solicitor who was the lead prosecutor on Smith’s case said.\nSome jurors he heard from after the trial believed a greater punishment for Smith would be to spend a lifetime in jail, thinking about her sons, Pope said.\nBut this hasn’t been the case, said Pope.\n“Susan has been focused on Susan for 30 years, not Michael and Alex,” he said.\nPope is against Smith’s parole and said he will be speaking before the parole board at the hearing Wednesday. He said he has been in touch with Smith’s ex-husband – the children’s father – who will also attend the hearing to oppose the parole. “He just wants to make sure Michael and Alex are not forgotten,” Pope said.\nIn 2004, David Smith told Larry King on CNN that he believed his ex-wife deserved the death penalty. CNN has not received a response to efforts to contact David Smith, but he spoke to Court TV last month.\nHe said he had forgiven Susan Smith but wanted justice to be served. He said he planned to remind the parole board “what Susan did” and “who were the victims in this case – certainly not her.”\nDavid Smith said his ex-wife serving only 30 years would be an injustice to Michael and Alex. “She doesn’t deserve to ever be free again,” he said.\n",

    "content": "X competitor Bluesky rocketed to the No. 1 spot on the Apple App Store’s US chart this week, as many users of Elon Musk’s platform said they were decamping in the wake of his significant role in the US presidential election.\nBluesky’s user base has doubled in the past 90 days — on Tuesday the company said it had gained 1 million new sign-ups in the past week alone, bringing it to more than 15 million total users.\nThe energy on X is markedly different: Musk spent months using the site to boost President-elect Donald Trump. In recent days, researchers have recorded surges in sexist language like “your body, my choice” on the site. And that’s on top of previous changes by Musk, like cutting moderators, restoring banned accounts, allowing racist and Nazi accounts and changing the platform’s verification system to boost anyone who was willing to pay, regardless of what they posted — all of which helped to tank the company’s core ad business.\nA number of prominent journalists announced their exit, accordingly, from X to join Bluesky this week, including the Atlantic’s Charlie Warzel, the New York Times’ Mara Gay and former CNN anchor Don Lemon. UK newspaper The Guardian also said Wednesday that it will no longer post to X from its official channels, calling X “a toxic media platform,” although it did not specify which other platforms it plans to use to promote its work.\nBut while Bluesky may be having A Moment three years after its launch, any claims that it will kill X should be taken with a grain of salt.\nAs a private company, X doesn’t share user numbers. Recent third party estimates of user trends are mixed, although the consistent user growth the platform enjoyed prior to Musk’s takeover does appear to have been upended in the past two years. But — for better or, probably, worse — the site has so far weathered the creation of multiple other competitors, the reinstatement of White supremacists and the spread of racist conspiracy theories from Musk down without fading into irrelevance.\n“X usage is at an all-time high and continues to surge,” X CEO Linda Yaccarino said in a post Wednesday. “To all of our users — of every interest, political party, and point of view — You will always have a place to engage and join the global conversation freely and safely.”\nMore than 115,000 US X users deactivated their accounts the day after the election, the largest single-day exit since Musk assumed control of the platform, according to digital intelligence platform Similarweb. And that included only users who deactivated through the website, not the mobile app.\nBut X also had its highest web traffic all year that same day, racking up 46.5 million visits on desktop alone, up 38% from the average of the preceding few months, Similarweb said. Bluesky also saw daily visits jump on Election Day and the day after to 1.2 million and 1.3 million, respectively, up from around 800,000 in the days before.\n“Whether there will be a measurable decrease in the audience for X as the result of politics remains to be seen,” David Carr, Similarweb editor of insights, news and research, said in a blog post Tuesday. But, he added, “X’s recent daily peak in US traffic doesn’t make up for the erosion in audience the service has seen over the past couple of years since Musk took ownership of the service.”\nSensor Tower, another market intelligence firm, found that daily active app users and time spent on X jumped on November 5 and 6 compared to the prior 30 days. But by November 10, X daily active users were relatively flat compared to just before the election, whereas Bluesky saw a 28% jump in users in the same period.\nRelated article\nTired of Elon Musk? Here are the Twitter alternatives you should know about\nStill, X has far more users than Bluesky, Sensor Tower noted. (Bluesky also remains much smaller than Meta’s Threads.)\nA third app data analysis firm, Apptopia, also told CNN that activity on X jumped significantly ahead of the election. It said X’s daily active users peaked days later, on November 9, before tapering off slightly. On Bluesky, daily users more than doubled from-mid October to the post-election week.\nHere’s the takeaway from all those numbers: X had a big jump in usage leading up to and on Election Day and the day after, but it appears to be waning. At the same time, Bluesky saw a surge after the election that looks to be continuing, although its overall user base is still relatively small.\nOf course, lots of people flock to all kinds of media during and around an election week. And it’s worth remembering that we’ve seen troves of users swear off X before in the wake of earlier Musk incidents, only for many of them to come trickling back to the platform.\nNonetheless, anecdotally, some prominent social media users say they’re now seeing more engagement with their posts — the thing users on these sites typically prize above all else — on Bluesky, despite having larger followings on X.\nEd Zitron, founder of media relations firm EZPR, told CNN he and others have remained on X “because there is a critical mass of readers on there and there is a virality to the content you post.”\nBut, Zitron said, “with how Bluesky is scaling right now, I don’t see how (X) stays dominant,” adding that he has 90,000 followers on X but “the actual engagement doesn’t seem to matching up.”\nNew York Times journalist Mike Isaac had a similar remark in a Bluesky post Tuesday: “real disorienting to go from twitter — where i do a post to 200k followers and get five favs — over to bluesky where a post gets like 200 favs immediately.”\nBut here’s the thing: Even if X was hemorrhaging users to Bluesky, there’s no sign Musk would care enough to do anything.\nAlthough Musk said when he acquired the platform that he wanted it to be a “politically neutral” digital town square, X took a sharp turn toward the right under his leadership, even before he began championing Trump and his MAGA movement. Musk made X the first mainstream social platform to restore Trump’s account after he was widely banned following the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, prompting other platforms to do the same. In the run-up to the election, Musk spread false and misleading claims about Trump’s competitor, Vice President Kamala Harris. The platform also reportedly pushed political and pro-Trump content on users, whether they wanted it or not.\nNow, X has become something of a hub for right-leaning social media users.\nRelated article\nElon Musk has met with politicians from at least 13 different countries: Here’s what he has talked about\nAnd by using the platform as a megaphone to promote Trump, Musk may have gotten the kind of return that he couldn’t even imagine when he bought Twitter for $44 billion two years ago: direct access to the US president.\nTrump announced Tuesday night that Musk will take on an official role in his administration, becoming one of two people to lead a new “Department of Government Efficiency” alongside Vivek Ramaswamy. Musk also joined a call between Trump and Ukranian President Vladimir Zelensky immediately following the election, presumably to discuss the country’s war with Russia, in which Musk’s Starlink has played a key role as a communication tool.\nAnd Musk’s personal wealth also jumped by $26.5 billion the day after the election, as investors hope his relationship with Trump will boost his companies’ fortunes.\nThat’s almost certainly worth plenty more than X’s declining ad revenue and any lost users in Musk’s mind.\n–CNN’s Liam Reilly and Matt Egan contributed to this report.\n",

    "content": "President Biden's permission for Ukraine to use American-made missiles for strikes on Russia has triggered a global conflict, a close ally of Vladimir Putin has claimed.\nOn Sunday, Biden fulfilled a longstanding Ukrainian request by authorizing the country's use of U.S.-supplied Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) for long-range strikes inside Russian territory, officials confirmed to Reuters, AP and several other news agencies.\nUkraine has launched an ATACMS strike, according to Russia's Defense Ministry, prompting Moscowto warn of a stark escalation in the conflict.\n\"The use of alliance missiles in this way can now be qualified as an attack by the bloc's countries on Russia,\" Dmitry Medvedev posted to Telegram on Tuesday.\n\"In this case, the right arises to launch a retaliatory strike with weapons of mass destruction against Kyiv and the main NATO facilities, wherever they are. And this is already WWIII.\"\nMedevdev, who currently serves as deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, also claimed that the decision taken by Biden was a \"deliberate\" effort to create \"such an escalation of the conflict that Trump's team will have to deal with.\"\nNewsweek has contacted the Biden White House for a response to Medvedev's statement.\nMedvedev, who has held the position of both president and prime minister of the country, said that the \"unconfirmed decision\" by Biden would \"not be able to make a significant contribution to the enemy's military actions.\"\nHowever, he said that the strikes would nevertheless have an escalatory impact, thanks to Russia's recent decision to alter its guidelines on the use of nuclear weapons.\nOn Tuesday, Russia's Ministry of Defense announced that Putin had ratified an alteration in Russia's nuclear policy, first announced by the leader in late September. These broader criteria would classify any largescale attack on Russian territory as meriting a nuclear response, while aggression from any state with the assistance of another would be treated as a joint attack on the Russian Federation.\nOther officials within Russia have issued similar warnings, with Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova on Tuesday stating that Kyiv's use of American missiles for long-range strikes would constitute \"the direct participation of the United States and its satellites in military operations against Russia, as well as a radical change in the essence and nature of the conflict.\"\n\"Russia's response will then be adequate and tangible,\" she added.\nNewsweek has contacted the Russian Ministry of Foreign Ministry for further comment on the decision by President Biden.\nOn Tuesday, Russia's Defense Ministry said that Ukraine had struck a facility in the Bryansk region with \"American-made ATACMS operational-tactical missiles.\" While nearly all of the missiles were reportedly intercepted, the ministry said that fragments of one fell inside a military facility, causing a fire which was eventually extinguished.\nSpeaking at a press conference on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Brazil, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that the attack proved America's intention to \"escalate\" the conflict, Kyiv Post reported, and promised to \"react accordingly.\"\nRussia may already be preparing such a response, with the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv issuing a warning to its employees over a \"a potential significant air attack on November 20.\"\n\"The U.S. Embassy recommends U.S. citizens be prepared to immediately shelter in the event an air alert is announced,\" the embassy said in its announcement.\nDo you have a story we should be covering?

    "content": "A special crisis hotline between the U.S. and Russia is not active, the Kremlin said on Wednesday, after Russian President Vladimir Putin approved a change to when Moscow could use nuclear weapons.\nMoscow has around 5,580 nuclear warheads, the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) said earlier this year. Around 1,200 of these are retired, and approximately 4,380 are stockpiled, according to the FAS.\n\"We have a special secure line for communication between the two presidents, Russia and the United States,\" Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. But the channel is not currently in use, he said in remarks reported by Reuters.\nOn Tuesday, Putin rubber-stamped a change to Russia's nuclear doctrine, which now says Moscow can justify a nuclear strike in response to an attack on Russia by a non-nuclear country, if they are backed by a nuclear-armed nation.\nThe document also said Russia could launch a nuclear strike if targeted with a large-scale non-nuclear air attack. This also applies to key ally Belarus, the Kremlin said. Russia stations tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, which it used as a springboard for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nThe more than 1,000 days of war in Ukraine has marked the worst dip in relations between Washington and Moscow since the Cold War. U.S. officials said earlier this week that the White House had approved Ukraine using American long-range ballistic missiles to attack Russian soil, which Moscow condemned as a \"new phase of the Western war\" and an escalation to the conflict.\nRussia has the world's largest stockpile of nuclear weapons, followed closely by the U.S.'s nuclear arsenal. Combined, Moscow and Washington control around 90 percent of the nuclear weapons across the globe.\nExact counts vary, but currently nine countries possess a total of roughly 12,100 nuclear weapons—the U.S., France and the United Kingdom within NATO, as well as the non-NATO nations Russia, China, Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea.\nAn estimated 1,710 of the warheads that can be used by the Russian military are deployed on the likes of intercontinental ballistic missiles or at strategic bomber bases, the organization said. The U.S. has approximately 1,670 deployed strategic warheads, according to the FAS.\nStrategic nuclear weapons are capped by the New START Treaty at 1,550 warheads and a maximum of 700 long-range missiles and bombers. The U.S. deploys 1,419 and Russia 1,549 strategic warheads across bombers and missiles, the Arms Control Association said, as of July.\nNon-strategic or tactical nuclear weapons, which are shorter-range and less destructive, are not covered by arms treaties. The State Department said in April that it believed Russia had between 1,000 and 2,000 non-strategic nuclear warheads, including those on air-to-surface missiles, torpedoes, gravity bombs and nuclear mines.\nRussia suspended its cooperation with the New START Treaty in February 2023. The U.S. then limited how transparent it was being about its nuclear weapons with Russia, although both parties said they will stick to the limits of the treaty until 2026.\nRussia has long been modernizing its nuclear forces, including phasing in its Sarmat and Yars intercontinental ballistic missiles.\nAs Moscow's troops poured into Ukraine in late February 2022, Putin placed his country's nuclear deterrence forces on high alert. Months later, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the risks of nuclear conflict had become \"considerable.\"\nProminent Russian officials, such as former President Dmitry Medvedev, who has stayed on as a hawkish voice on the Kremlin political scene, as well as Russian state television commentators, have frequently mentioned the prospect of nuclear war.\nSome state media hosts and guests have suggested that Moscow should launch nuclear strikes on countries, such as the U.S. and U.K., that support Kyiv's war effort.\nPutin said in March this year that Russia was militarily equipped and \"ready\" for nuclear war. António Guterres, the secretary-general of the United Nations, said in September 2022 that the idea of nuclear war had been \"once unthinkable,\" but now was \"a subject of debate.\"\n\"This in itself is totally unacceptable,\" Guterres said.\n",

    "content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has indicated he is open to negotiating a ceasefire in Ukraine with incoming U.S. President Donald Trump but remains firm on critical conditions, reports Reuters news agency. Putin has ruled out any significant territorial concessions and demands that Kyiv abandon its NATO membership ambitions.\nTrump, who has vowed to swiftly end the war, takes office amid Russia's strongest position in the conflict to date. Moscow now controls a swath of Ukrainian territory roughly the size of Virginia, with its forces advancing at their most rapid pace since the early days of the 2022 invasion. The stage is set for high-stakes diplomacy as the two leaders prepare to address one of the most pressing global conflicts.\nAccording to the report, in the first detailed insights into what Russian President Vladimir Putin might accept in a peace deal brokered by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, five current and former Russian officials suggested the Kremlin could broadly agree to freezing the conflict along existing front lines.\nThree of these individuals, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the discussions, said there might be room for negotiation over the specific divisions of the eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. This potential flexibility underscores the complexity of any prospective ceasefire arrangement.\nWhile Moscow asserts that the four regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson are fully integrated into Russia and protected under its nuclear umbrella, its forces currently control only 70-80 percent of the territory. Approximately 10,000 square miles remain under Ukrainian control.\nReuters further reported that two officials familiar with Kremlin discussions suggested that Russia might be willing to withdraw from smaller pockets of territory it holds in Ukraine's Kharkiv and Mykolaiv regions, located in the north and south, respectively. These potential concessions hint at areas of flexibility in future negotiations, despite Russia's broader territorial claims.\nBack in June, Putin said he would consider a ceasefire or a freeze to the war in Ukraine if Kyiv abandoned its hopes of joining NATO and withdrew its troops from the regions of Ukraine that Russia has said it has annexed.\nMoscow has controlled Crimea, to the south of mainland Ukraine, since 2014, and declared in September 2022 that it had annexed the Donetsk and Luhansk regions collectively known as the Donbas, as well as the southern Ukrainian Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions.\nThe Kremlin's grip on these regions is not internationally recognized. Kyiv has vowed to reclaim them.\nUkraine's leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, has spurned Trump's proposals and insisted Kyiv needs to join NATO as soon as possible and has refused to cede territory to Moscow.\n\"I believe that President Trump really wants a quick decision\" to end the conflict, Zelensky remarked at a European summit earlier this month, but he added, \"It doesn't mean that it will happen this way.\"\nHe stressed that a peace process must be just and not risk leaving Ukraine vulnerable. \"He [Trump] wants this war to be finished,\" Zelensky continued, acknowledging that while everyone shares that goal, a hasty resolution \"is going to be a loss for Ukraine.\"\nThis caution highlights Zelensky's concerns that Trump's approach could lead to a ceasefire agreement that undermines Ukraine's territorial integrity.\nThe Ukrainian leader argued that any resolution with Russia should not simply halt hostilities but should secure a fair outcome for Kyiv.\nNewsweek has reached out to spokespersons from both Ukraine and Russia for comment via email.\n",

    "content": "When my two young sons woke up the day after Trump decisively won re-election, my wife and I delivered the news: The candidate we voted for the day before— Kamala Harris—had lost.\nMy older son, 6, immediately asked us: \"What was the final score?\"—he had recently experienced the Yankees' defeat by the Dodgers, so he was no stranger to a hard loss.\nWe tried to explain to him about the Electoral College, and what it meant for someone to win an election and how it wasn't quite like a baseball game, but also that it kind of was. He clearly wasn't following too closely, so I decided to wrap up the conversation by saying: \"What's most important, no matter who is in charge of our country, is that today, you are kind.\"\n\"That's the only thing you can control,\" my wife added.\nI believe that Donald Trump is not a kind person, no matter what you think of him as a person, or of his policies or his coalition. For many, I believe that's the appeal. A headline on his victory, by The New York Times, proclaimed that \"America Hires a Strongman.\"\nHis closing message to the country was filled with personal attacks against Liz Cheney, and statements describing Puerto Rico as a \"floating island of garbage.\" At a rally in Pennsylvania, he then commented on the bulletproof glass surrounding him, stating that an assassin would have to shoot through the news media to get to him, adding, \"I don't mind that so much.\"\nMy hope was that my sons would not remember a time when Donald Trump was president. Not because I want to shield my sons from the reality of a Trump presidency, but because I do not want my children to see a model of manhood, and specifically, of male leadership, that is anything close to Trump.\nWhen I talk with my kids about how they should behave in school, or with friends, or with our family, it always comes back to one thing: Be kind. Your brother hit you? Hitting him back doesn't help—be kind. You don't like that I won't let you eat another piece of Halloween candy? You don't need to yell—be kind. I'm sorry that you tripped and fell at the playground, but you shouldn't get angry at anyone, especially yourself. It was a mistake.\nI struggle with the anger that comes as I try to parent two young kids. I can quickly get into an epic battle-of-the-wills—that does not end in my favor—just to get them out in the morning or into bed at night. My temper flares, I yell, I lose my cool. Always, it never helps. Getting out of the door is harder and bedtime drags on.\nBe kind, my wife reminds me. It's all you can control. It always helps.\nNow, I'm not so sure. Kindness does not win elections, it seems. The American people are clearly looking for someone who is a fighter, who will be a \"strong leader\"—whatever that means—and who will not back down from his anger.\nIt seems as if we elected him president not because of what we want him to do for us, but because of what we want him to do to others: Break the system, tear down enemies, all while showing no remorse nor fear nor sympathy.\nI wonder if my advice to \"be kind\" will help my boys succeed in a world that looks to this type of leader. I am sympathetic to the arguments of the need for a wholesale change to our system, and I remain hopeful that Trump will deliver on his promise that \"he alone can fix it.\" Yet, I do wonder at what cost that fix will come, especially to our boys.\nPart of Trump's closing message was that of protection. He said he would protect women \"whether they like it or not.\" Part of Trump's appeal is his hyper masculinity, which cannot be separated from his relationship to women.\nProtection \"whether they like it or not\" is the close cousin to, \"when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\" It's a masculinity of self-determination, no matter what those choices do for anyone else.\nYet, I am trying to teach my boys a masculinity of compassion. I believe, as men, we must care for the ones we care about. That includes protection, sure, but it also includes respect and empathy.\nI want this for my boys not because of any feminist ideals, but the exact opposite: Because I do believe that care, and yes, kindness, is a core part of what it means to be a man.\nWe, as men, should look out for our communities and protect those around us, whether that's the act of providing—through a job or otherwise—volunteering in community groups, or just being a person everyone knows they can go to when a neighbor needs some help.\nThis also means listening to and supporting women, based on what they say they need. Charlie Kirk, a Trump surrogate, reacted to an ad telling women to secretly vote for Harris, by saying \"She's coming in with her sweet husband, who probably works his tail off to make sure that she can go and have a nice life and provide to the family—then she lies to him.\"\nKrik can have his own feelings and perspectives about American marriage, but when I think about my boys, I wonder: Do I want them to one day marry a woman who thinks she has to lie to him?\nThe next several years will be full of difficult conversations as we talk to our boys about what the president—supposedly the role model for the nation—did and why that's different than what we tell them to do. I worry that if my kind boys turn into kind men, the world will grind them down just as Trump hopes to do to those who disagree with them.\nI do not know if that will happen. I hope not. Because, that day after the election, I did another thing: I went and bought my wife flowers. There was no reason, other than I felt like I wanted to do something kind for someone. It was the only thing I could control.\nJeff Raderstrong is a writer and ghostwriter focused on the intersection of politics, the economy, and culture.\nAll views expressed are the author's own.\nDo you have a unique experience or personal story to share?

    "content": "An anonymous male celebrity says he is the victim of an extortion scheme and is suing a high-powered Texas attorney who is representing several people in civil lawsuits that accuse Sean “Diddy” Combs of sexual assault.\nThe unnamed plaintiff, described in the lawsuit as “a celebrity and public figure who resides in Los Angeles,” filed his complaint under a “John Doe” pseudonym this week in Los Angeles Superior Court. He has accused Houston-based attorney Tony Buzbee and his firm of “shamelessly attempting to extort exorbitant sums from him or else publicly file wildly false horrific allegations against him.”\nA spokesperson for Quinn Emanuel, the law firm representing Doe, confirms that the complaint was filed on Monday.\nBuzbee has said he is representing at least 120 alleged victims of Combs. Over the past month, he has filed more than a dozen civil lawsuits against Combs, in some cases accusing the producer of drugging and sexually assaulting plaintiffs, some of whom allege they were minors at the time.\nCombs, who is in jail awaiting his criminal trial, has denied the allegations against him.\nThe lawsuit filed by the anonymous celebrity claims that Buzbee’s firm is trying to capitalize off the “explosive allegations against Sean Combs” by roping in public figures who have been acquainted with Combs.\nAttorneys for Doe claim that Buzbee sent a demand letter earlier this month in which his firm “threatened to unleash entirely fabricated and salacious allegations of sexual assault” that include “multiple instances of rape of a minor, both male and female” if their client “refuses to comply with their demands.”\nIn the demand letter, attorneys for the male celebrity said that Buzbee characterized their famous client as “having been friends with Mr. Combs based on the fact that the two often attention similar events frequented by celebrities.”\n“These baseless accusations are nothing more than a weapon in a calculated plot to destroy Plaintiff’s high-profile reputation for profit, despite the complete absence of any factual basis for such claims,” the lawsuit states.\nDoe’s lawsuit states that he is filing anonymously to avoid “irreparable harm to reputation.”\nBuzbee denied the extortion claims against him, in an Instagram post in which he wrote that his firm “won’t allow the powerful and their high-dollar lawyers to intimidate or silence sexual assault survivors,” and in a statement to CNN.\n“If you are trying to hide your identity and you claim you did nothing wrong, doesn’t seem very smart to take this approach,” Buzbee told CNN in an email on Monday. “We will address it in due course.”\n“I have confidence that with full public disclosure all of this will sort itself out,” Buzbee wrote.\nThe celebrity’s lawsuit applauds Combs’ accusers who have spoken out with their names attached to their lawsuits but cast doubt on some of the allegations filed anonymously as a “Jane Doe” or “John Doe,” stating that Buzbee’s firm has “managed to find some 120 plaintiffs” who “claim to have been sexually assaulted by Combs.”\nThe lawsuit accuses Buzbee of creating “a pocket industry that capitalizes on the bravery of those victims who came forward to shakedown innocent celebrities, politicians, and businesspeople with an army of masked accusers.”\nLast month, a judge ruled that one of Buzbee’s civil suits against Combs could not proceed with the female accuser filing under a pseudonym, stating that Combs has the right to defend himself by investigating the plaintiff. Shortly after her “Jane Doe” status was denied, the accuser refiled her complaint under her real name.\nIn an interview with CNN last month, Buzbee explained that his firm initially files cases anonymously in an effort to protect the safety of his clients. But he said that each of his 120 clients are prepared to testify and publicly reveal their names.\n“They think that (if) the person’s name is revealed that maybe they’ll go crawl back under a rock and we’ll never hear from them again,” Buzbee said. “I’ve told every client when we file your case, be prepared that your identity will be revealed.”\nBuzbee has said that he does not believe Combs acted alone in his alleged misconduct. He said in a press conference last month that his clients have shared information pertaining to celebrities, entertainment executives, business entities and other high-profile individuals that were complicit or engaged in Combs’ alleged abuse.\nIn Doe’s lawsuit this week, his attorneys paint a different picture.\n“It is a cynical extortion scheme that is dressed up in vindicating victims of actual sexual abuse,” the lawsuit states. “Defendants corrupting this righteous cause by trying to monetize the victimization of the women who suffered at the hands of this one guy.”\n",

    "content": "The etymology of \"doge\" is kind of amazing. It started as a meme depicting a skeptical-looking Shiba Inu dog. Then came Dogecoin—a cryptocurrency. Now it's the...Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)?\nNevertheless, the DOGE represents a harbinger of deregulation for an incoming Trump administration, especially with Dogecoin enthusiast Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy at the helm. Musk minced no words when describing the government as a \"strangulation by overregulation.\" And with the federal government issuing close to 4,500 new regulations each year, he ain't wrong.\nEnvironmental, historic preservation, and permitting rules in particular have become untethered from their stated aims. Their processes have become arduous and contorted, delaying everything from broadband deployment to space launches.\nRegulations even gum up the government's own programs. In 2021, Congress allocated $42 billion to the Department of Commerce to expand high-speed broadband to rural Americans. The results of this massive investment? Not one single deployment in more than three years. Worse, the earliest the program's builds can take place is 2026. Why? According to Federal Communications Commission member Brendan Carr, a host of \"regulations\" and inconsistent agency processes have contributed to \"a chaotic implementation environment\" marked by \"dysfunction\" and \"delays.\"\nSo, a call for a more efficient government is not only a welcome sentiment, but a necessary one. In fairness, calling for government efficiency has long been a bipartisan priority. Indeed, Presidents John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan both slashed income taxes, and President Jimmy Carter deregulated the airlines. In more modern contexts, both the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations deregulated the internet access market. President Donald Trump's first term, too, cut its fair share of red tape.\nBut the DOGE is one of the most aggressive plans to speed up the wheels of government we've ever seen.\nEven though the form the DOGE will take is still getting worked out, its mission is clear: trim the regulatory fat to cut unnecessary executive mandates, duplicative regulations, and find cost-saving measures for the government. Another thing we know for sure is that the DOGE isn't permanent. Indeed, the Trump administration has set a firm deadline of \"no later than July 4, 2026\" to accomplish its goals to cut government waste.\nHowever, government waste will continue to be an issue long after the DOGE is set to terminate. So how do we institutionalize it?\nOne option is to have the DOGE reinvigorate and advise the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), the objectives of which line up fairly well with the DOGE's. Established in 1980, OIRA sits within the White House's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and is comprised of five subject matter branches. It even has its own administrator, who is appointed by the president and confirmed by the United States Senate.\nBut what is it tasked to do? In part, review federal regulations from executive agencies \"to avoid inconsistent, incompatible, or duplicative policies.\" OIRA is also tasked with ensuring \"that agencies' rules reflect the president's policies and priorities.\" In other words, if deregulation is an aspect of its efficiency metric, then OIRA seems like the most straightforward vessel for the DOGE to use.\nThe DOGE will have precedent with which to work. Both Republican and Democratic administrations have used OIRA to pare back unnecessary regulations. To limit government waste, President Reagan issued his Executive Order 12291, which required agencies to only take regulatory action if they could demonstrate that \"the potential benefit to society for the regulation outweighed the costs to society.\" President George H.W. Bush used OIRA to establish his \"Council on Competitiveness\" to review regulations issued by agencies the administration believed would have a significant impact on the economy or particular industries.\nThanks to the Obama administration, OIRA facilitates agencies' \"retrospective reviews\" on already promulgated regulations to rid out \"outmoded, ineffective, insufficient, or excessively burdensome, and to modify, streamline, expand, or repeal them.\" President Trump himself used OIRA to \"achieved a 12-to-1 ratio of deregulatory-to-regulatory actions in fiscal year 2018, for a net savings of $23 billion (equivalent to about $1.6 billion in annual savings).\"\nThe DOGE's work can continue under OIRA long after the July 4, 2026 deadline. It can serve as a powerful mechanism to accomplish the Trump administration's goals. Every federal agency that isn't an independent agency is under its purview. There's a lot an OIRA administrator can do to continue the work of the DOGE.\nJoel Thayer is president of the Digital Progress Institute and an attorney based in Washington, D.C.\nThe views expressed in this article are the writer's own.\n",

    "content": "Europe could soon be welcoming a wave of well-heeled Americans, as Democratic voters facing the prospect of another Donald Trump presidency eye refuges abroad.\nInterest in so-called “golden visas” has skyrocketed among US citizens since the election, according to consultants that help the wealthy migrate. Golden visas allow people to effectively buy foreign citizenship or residence through sizable investments, including in real estate, government bonds or startups.\nHenley & Partners, which claims to have invented the concept of citizenship-by-investment in the 1990s, said inquiries by US nationals via its website spiked almost 400% the week of the election compared with the prior week.\nMany of these individuals don’t plan on permanently relocating to a new country, however. “The main focus for most Americans is just having the optionality… like an insurance policy,” said Dominic Volek, head of private clients at Henley & Partners.\nArton Capital, another investment migration consultancy, said it received well over 100 inquiries the day after Trump’s decisive victory was called, five times the typical daily average.\n“A very small percentage of these people are actually relocating, but they all want to have the option as a Plan B,” CEO Armand Arton told CNN. “We will definitely be very busy (over) the next six months with the US market.”\nOne Italian village is trying to make the most of the sudden spike in demand: Following the election, the village of Ollolai, on the island of Sardinia, launched a website offering ultra-cheap homes in the hope that those upset by the result will snap up one of its empty properties.\nHistorically, residence- and citizenship-by-investment programs have attracted emerging market elites — including from Nigeria, South Africa, China, India and the Philippines — who typically face higher levels of political and economic instability at home or who want a second passport to enable visa-free travel.\nAmericans were not a major source of demand for golden visas until the pandemic, when Covid lockdowns meant they were unable to visit Europe without a European passport, even if they owned second homes on the continent or could travel by private jet, according to Volek.\n“A lot of the very wealthy families… were a little bit more exposed than they realized,” he told CNN.\nDemand has been rising ever since, with increased political division and social tension in the United States also driving interest, according to a Henley & Partners report published earlier this year. Since 2020, US nationals have been the firm’s single largest cohort of applicants for investment migration programs.\nInquiries about golden visas from Americans have increased 33% so far this year compared with the same period last year, with programs in Europe the most sought after.\nPortugal’s Golden Residence Permit Program tops the popularity list because it is relatively affordable, requiring a minimum outlay of €250,000 ($265,000) in support of the arts or national cultural heritage. It also offers a path to European Union citizenship after only five years, as opposed to seven to 10 years in countries such as Greece, Spain and Italy, which are also popular choices among Americans.\nThe super-rich — those with a net worth of $50 million and above — tend to favor Malta or Austria, according to Volek, which offer immediate paths to citizenship but at a much higher price.\nMalta’s program requires a non-refundable payment to the government of €600,000 ($636,000), with considerable additional spending on real estate in the country and a €10,000 ($10,600) donation to local charities. Austria demands a direct contribution to the economy, such as an investment in a local business, which usually starts at around €3.5 million ($3.7 million).\nWith golden visas out of reach for most Americans, social media platforms are ablaze with chatter about other avenues for moving abroad.\nA YouTube video on “countries for Americans who want to leave the US,” posted less than two weeks ago by a couple who help people move abroad, has received more than half a million views and 4,000 comments, including from Americans who say they are urgently exploring options for living overseas.\nElsewhere, on Reddit, one thread entitled “Emigrating after the US election results” has received 1,300 comments in less than two weeks.\nIn an LGBT Reddit group, one user posted shortly before the election that they and their husband feel that “leaving the USA as refugees may be necessary if Trump ends up winning.”\nFlannery Foster, an American living in Spain who helps other Americans travel, work and study abroad, has heard similar stories.\n“I’ve been talking to people (whose) lives are at risk and their livelihoods are at risk,” Foster told CNN, referring to women, Black people, parents with transgender children and the LGBTQ+ community. “These people are not your golden visa people,” she added.\nSince the election, Foster, who is in the process of obtaining Spanish citizenship, has seen “exponential growth” in inquiries and says she is currently working with around 50 people interested in living outside the US.\nThese individuals don’t want to surrender their US citizenship, however. “There is a sense that, ‘I’m leaving because I have to and I want to make sure that my vote still counts.’”\n",

    "content": "China showed off its rapidly advancing military technology by unveiling a string of cutting-edge hardware at the country’s largest airshow last week.\nThe biennial event in the southern city of Zhuhai has become a rare public window into the military and industrial might of the rising communist-controlled superpower, while also providing international experts with an opportunity to assess its capabilities.\nMany of the new Chinese weapons are seen by experts as having been developed to match the United States, as authoritarian Beijing pushes to modernize its armed forces and assert its growing military presence in Asia.\nThis year’s event featured a range of new weapons systems, including fighter jets and missiles. It also for the first time featured a dedicated area for drones, in a sign of their increasingly critical role on battlefields, including in the Ukraine war – and any potential future conflict over the self-governing island of Taiwan.\nThe six-day exhibition drew in nearly 600,000 visitors and more than 280 billion yuan ($39 billion) in global orders – as well as a stopover by Russia’s former defense chief, according to state media.\nHere are some of the most notable new weapon systems put on public display at the show.\nMore than a decade in the making, China’s much-anticipated new stealth fighter jet, the J-35A, is widely seen as part of Beijing’s bid to match the United States’ stealth fighter capabilities.\nThe J-35A is China’s second stealth fighter, after the J-20 entered service in 2017. Its commission makes China the second country after the US to have two types of stealth fighter jets.\nSome observers have noted a resemblance in appearance between the J-35A and the US’ F-35. Though unlike the F-35, which features a single turbofan engine, the J-35A is equipped with two engines.\nIts maximum takeoff weight is likely to be approaching 30 tons, Song Xinzhi, a Chinese military expert and former researcher in the PLA Air Force, told state broadcaster CCTV, hailing it a “breakthrough” for China’s new generation of medium-sized stealth fighters.\nHe added that the J-35A is an air force variant of the fighter.  “(It) also has a twin navy variant, which is expected to be unveiled to the public soon,” Song said.\nWei Dongxu, a military commentator, claimed a key feature of the J-35A is its apparent versatility.\n“It can not only perform air combat missions, but also … execute precise strikes on both ground and maritime targets,” he told CCTV, noting that the jet can carry a wide range of precision-guided munitions within its internal weapons bay, including small air-launched cruise missiles.\nExperts have been quick to compare the HQ-19, China’s new-generation surface-to-air missile system, to the US’ Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) system.\nMounted on an 8x8 high-mobility vehicle, the HQ-19 carries six interceptor missiles and uses a “cold launch” mechanism that reduces the stress on the launcher and allows it to rapidly redeploy interceptors, according to state media reports.\nChina has not revealed the technical specifics of the system, and it remains unclear whether it can match the operational range or hit speed of THAAD. The US Defense Department’s annual report on China’s military in 2020 said the HQ-19 interceptor has undergone tests to verify its capability against 3,000 kilometer-range ballistic missiles.\nChinese military experts say it is tasked with intercepting ballistic missiles outside the atmosphere, significantly extending the interception range of previous models like the HQ-9.\nMost notably, Chinese experts and state media have also claimed the HQ-19 is capable of intercepting hypersonic glide vehicles in the atmosphere.\nSuch weapons are “challenging due to their unpredictable trajectory,” said PLA Senior Col. Du Wenlong of the PLA Academy of Military Sciences.\n“Our radar system, however, can track these complex trajectories and guide missiles for a final strike. Many countries address hypersonic warheads by deploying multiple rapid warheads, ensuring at least one hit. But with the combination of the HQ-19 missile and our radar system, we’ve resolved this issue with a single radar and a single missile,” he told CCTV.\nA massive mothership drone that can carry a payload of up to six tons, Jetank has a wingspan of 25 meters (82 feet) and a maximum takeoff weight of 16 tons, according to state media, making it among the largest such weapons in China’s arsenal.\nThe jet-powered attack and reconnaissance unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), features eight external hardpoints to carry missiles and bombs, as well as a quickly replaceable mission module that can carry different types of smaller drones.\n“It takes the concept of an aircraft carrier from the sea to the air, enabling the deployment of numerous drones onto the battlefield by launching them in the air,” Chinese military expert Du Wenlong claimed, hailing it a “significant innovation.”\nKnown as the “Orca” the JARI-USV-A is a high-speed stealth unmanned surface combat vessel.\nThe 500-ton vessel is designed to be highly radar resistant and features a unique trimaran structure that gives it stability in harsh seas, state media reports say.\nMeasuring 58 meters (190 feet) in length, 23 meters (75 feet) in beam and 4 meters (13 feet) in depth, the “Orca” can operate at speeds up to 40 knots with a range of 4,000 nautical miles, allowing for prolonged missions without resupply, according to China Military Online, the official English-language news website of the Chinese military.\n“As an autonomous combat vessel, it is like a mobile fortress on the sea which is capable of undertaking tasks such as beyond visual range fire strike, air and missile defense, and anti-submarine search and strike,” the China Military Online claimed in an article Tuesday.\n“Such platforms can regularly carry out non-military and military operations of low to medium intensity, such as patrol and guard around strategic points, base ports, islands and reefs, and key waterways,” it added.\nEquipped with four phased array radars and a vertical launch system, the vessel is said to be able to carry rockets, anti-ship missiles, air defense missiles and remote-control weapon stations. It also features a takeoff and landing platform for unmanned helicopters in the rear and a small docking bay at the stern, which can be used to launch small underwater devices or sensors for submarine detection, the article said.\nChina also unveiled a new version of its PL-15 long-range air-to-air missile. It comes with folding tailfins, a design that allows for more compact stowage to fit the country’s stealth fighter jets.\nAt the airshow, the PL-15E was displayed next to a model of the J35-A steal fighter jet.\nThe PL-15 is one of China’s most potent air-to-air missiles, with a range of around 200 kilometers and a peak speed above five times the speed of sound, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies.\nIt’s often compared to the US’ AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile.\nAlso on display at the airshow was the Su-57, Russia’s most advanced fighter jet, which made its first appearance away from home.\nThe overseas debut of the Su-57 in Zhuhai sent an unequivocal message about the close military cooperation between China and Russia.\nSergei Shoigu, Russia’s former defense minister who was in China for annual strategic security consultations, stopped by airshow to check out the Su-57 on display, according to the state-run Global Times.\nAt the airshow, the first contracts were signed for Russia to export its Su-57 to overseas customers, Russian news agency Tass reported, though it did not disclose the identity of the buyers.\n",

    "content": "A banana duct-taped to a wall first sold in 2019 for $120,000. It could fetch up to $1.5 million this week during a Sotheby’s auction.\nMore than 1,600 auction lots this week are estimated to fetch more than $1 billion — including Maurizio Cattelan’s “Comedian” (the duct-taped banana), Andy Warhol’s “New York Skyscrapers” and Rene Magritte’s “Empire of Light,” offered by major auctioneers Sotheby’s, Phillips and Christie’s.\nArtists and art dealers are hoping the sales will spark a turnaround from 2023, when the market for sales of high-end art contracted 27% from the year before — the first such decrease since 2020, according to Merrill Lynch.\nAnd the sales could also be a test of how the wealthy are feeling about the economy, both present and future, after President-elect Donald Trump clinched a second term just a few weeks ago.\nAlex Glauber, founder of AWG Art Advisory and president of the Association of Professional Art Advisors, told CNN that Trump’s victory is “likely to inject some vigor and momentum back into the market.”\nThat’s because many of the former president’s policies in his first term helped the wealthy get even wealthier — the kinds of customers who will be shopping at the upcoming art auctions.\n“The economic policies that disproportionately benefit the wealthy should catalyze demand on both the primary market for emerging talent and secondary market for more established and branded artists,” Glauber said.\nA little more than half of Phillips, Christie’s and Sotheby’s sales — which will carry the three aforementioned art pieces — were based in New York, where 34 of the top 50 auction lots were sold in 2023, according to an Art Basel and UBS Art Market Report.\nChristie’s is auctioning 689 lots this week as part of the November art auctions. It is estimating sales of up to $796 million. “Empire of Light,” by Belgian surrealist René Magritte, is expected to fetch at least $95 million at Christie’s.\n“It is poised to set a new record for the artist and establish a new benchmark for the entire Surrealist movement,” said Marc Porter, the chairman of Christie’s Americas. “This sale truly presents collectors with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and we look forward to seeing how our clients respond.”\nThat kind of purchase takes deep pockets — even as spending by those kinds of customers dropped last year. The average amount spent on art by high-net-worth individuals dropped 32% in 2023 year-over-year, according to the Art Basel and UBS Survey of Global Collecting report.\nStill, the incoming Trump administration has touted tax breaks, which could bode well for auctions of expensive collectibles and alternative assets, like art.\nTax cuts under the first Trump administration are set to expire in 2025, but he could extend them during his second presidency. Already, speculative assets like cryptocurrency have surged on expectations of a friendly Trump White House.\nBut Todd Levin of Levin Art Group was skeptical that tax cuts would do much for the art market. Tax cuts might help a little but otherwise wouldn’t make a big difference, he said, for the kinds of ultra-wealthy people who collect art.\n“It’s not going to have an outsize difference in terms of your financial strategy,” he said.\nAnother drag on the art market over the last few years: high interest rates. The Federal Reserve raised rates to a two-decade high to combat pandemic-era inflation. Only in September of this year did the Fed finally beginning cutting.\n“When (interest rates) come down the market heats up as capital is inexpensive and collectors look for hard assets as a store of value,” Glauber said. “However, that could be short-lived if they trigger a resurgence of inflation further exacerbated by the proposed trade policies.”\nDoug Woodham, an art advisor and former president of Christie’s Americas, said the same investors who benefited from Trump’s tax cuts in his first term could be hopeful for an extension under a second Trump presidency — and for lower interest rates to help push economic growth.\nThat would likely increase wealth for those invested in stocks, real estate and other assets, “that people can choose to spend however they want,” he said — including on art.\nNew York’s art auctions in the spring and fall could be a sign of things to come for the global art market, according to Woodham. The stock market has seen a rally since the election, fueled by expectations of pro-business policies under Trump.\nWhile Glauber said the art industry will ultimately be impacted by interest rates and the potential for inflation to come back, he said the sentiment at the November auctions is strong.\n“For now, there is definitely a palpable energy and renewed sense of optimism in the market heading into the auctions and Miami art fairs that close out the calendar year for the art world,” Glauber said.\nBut Amy Whitaker, an associate professor of art and economics at NYU Steinhardt, said the effects of the US presidential election results on the November auctions can be noisy and hard to pin down.\nRather, she said the auctions offer a chance to reflect on the artists and how their works ended up on sale — perhaps more meaningful than the price tag on the art.\n“I think it’s fair to say that the purpose of ‘Comedian’ is to call attention to the whole context in which that work is shown,” Whitaker said.\n",

    "content": "This year, daylight saving time ended on November 5, marking the transition to shorter days and earlier sunsets. The shift, while giving an extra hour of morning light, can create seasonal challenges such as lethargy, low mood, and fluctuations in appetite, all of which are often more pronounced in winter months.\nFor individuals with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), a type of depression linked to reduced seasonal light, these effects can be particularly severe. SAD impacts around 5 percent of adults in the United States, and its symptoms typically emerge in the fall or winter and can last until spring, according to the American Psychiatric Association. Symptoms may include persistent low energy, changes in sleep and appetite, feelings of hopelessness, and social withdrawal.\nThe abrupt end of daylight saving time can also disrupt established daily routines, making it harder for people to adjust. Studies have shown that the time change can impact sleep cycles, productivity, and even increase the risk of mood disorders.\nTo help manage these effects, Newsweek reached out to therapists and dieticians for expert advice on how to best prepare your body and mind for the end of daylight saving time.\nIf you're starting to feel down, sad, or depressed as the seasons change, let's acknowledge it. Labeling your feelings is a first step. Ask yourself, is this tied to an event of loss in my life, or simply coming with a change of seasons?\nIf it's due to a seasonal change, remember this is normal and predictable. SAD is a variant of major depression closely linked to the amount and duration of sunlight. Its onset and endpoint depend on how far north you live.\nOne solution is fairly straightforward—get more light. Purchase a SAD light and sit by it for 30-60 minutes a day. Open the blinds, work by a window, and get outside to maximize your exposure to natural light. If you can, plan a winter break to a warm and sunny place. A few years ago, we took a vacation to Southern California during February. What a difference! A burst of sunlight can help.\nWatch your diet and exercise. It's easy to become sedentary during the dark days of winter, so stay active. Plan your days to elevate your mood, doing things each day that provide a sense of accomplishment, whether large or small. It's easy to become isolated during winter. Our moods decline as we withdraw from others, so stay socially engaged. Each day, find things that give you pleasure, do something meaningful, express gratitude, and nurture hope.\nStress management is one of the best self-care strategies for coping with the end of daylight saving time and managing Seasonal Affective Disorder. I encourage making your environment sunnier and brighter. Open blinds, trim tree branches that block sunlight, or add skylights. Sit closer to bright windows at home or in the office.\nIt also helps to get outside. Take a long walk, eat lunch at a nearby park, or simply sit on a bench and soak up the sun. Even on cold or cloudy days, outdoor light can help, especially if you spend time outside within two hours of getting up in the morning.\nI'd also advise regular exercise. Physical activity relieves stress and anxiety, and being more fit can make you feel better about yourself, too, which can lift your mood. I recommend normalizing your sleep patterns—set reliable times to wake up and go to bed each day. For those with fall-winter-onset SAD, it's especially helpful to reduce or eliminate napping and oversleeping.\nIn order to adjust to the end of daylight saving time, try to keep regular bed and wake-up hours. If you feel lethargic in the morning or have trouble getting out of bed, and especially if you start feeling washed out, consider getting an artificial bright light.\nSit within a meter of the light and have it on for about 30 minutes in the morning. You can set it on a timer to go on when you want to wake up. It can be bright enough to seep through the covers or the pillow over your head.\nGo easy on carbohydrates and sugar, as cravings for these goes up in the winter for many people. Stay physically active, even if you don't feel like it.\nTry to keep up with friends and family. If you're not enjoying things that are usually fun, you've lost your sense of humor, you're more irritable or withdrawn than usual, your sleep has changed, or you can't let go of your feelings about recent events, you may be getting depressed. If bright light doesn't help, see your doctor. Seasonal depression responds to the same treatments as nonseasonal depression.\nTo help prevent or manage Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), it's important to begin preventive measures now, before the full darkness of winter sets in.\nEffective strategies include establishing with a health professional an exercise program that gradually builds endurance over weeks. Increase social contact with positive, supportive friends and family, quickly ending negative conversations. Use meditation and mindfulness once or twice a day to gain a break from stress, and schedule a time, three times a day, to provide yourself with positive messages about yourself and others.\nTell yourself to \"stop\" when experiencing negative thoughts and immediately think and do something you find pleasant. Eat healthy foods and avoid soothing negative moods with junk food and sweets. Make sleep a priority, and consider using a light box for 15-60 minutes daily. If self-help measures don't bring relief, seek professional help.\nOur diet plays a crucial role in both our physical and emotional well-being. Healthful eating patterns offer mental health benefits that are especially valuable as daylight wanes in the colder months. A growing body of research suggests a strong connection between gut and brain health, so our food choices have the potential to enhance mental well-being. High-fiber foods and fermented products like kefir, yogurt, sauerkraut, kimchi, and kombucha foster a healthy gut microbiome, and it's important to choose low-sugar options.\nSeveral dietary plans, including the Mediterranean, DASH, plant-based, and anti-inflammatory diets, offer solid foundations for both physical and mental health. In general, nutrient-dense foods from various groups are essential, but specific nutrients like iron, magnesium, B vitamins (especially folate and B12), and choline support mental health. Antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, green tea, and omega-3s found in fatty fish like salmon, anchovies, and tuna can bolster mental health, and plant-based omega-3 sources include walnuts, chia seeds, flaxseeds, and hemp seeds.\nIncorporating nutrient-dense foods is essential for this time of year. A few of my recommendations include omega-3 fatty acids from fatty fish like wild salmon, mackerel, and anchovies, as well as ground flaxseeds, chia seeds, and walnuts, all of which support brain health and may enhance mood.\nVitamin D, found in fortified dairy products, egg yolks, and sun-bathed mushrooms, is also important for mood regulation. Consider taking a vitamin D3 supplement and getting your vitamin D levels checked annually with a blood test for a personalized plan. Antioxidant-rich fruits and veggies like leafy greens, berries, and citrus support mental well-being by reducing oxidative stress.\nAs the days shorten, I suggest adjusting your diet to support energy and mood. Include vitamin D-rich foods to compensate for reduced sunlight, and aim to eat three balanced meals daily with protein, complex carbs, and healthy fats for sustained energy. Stay hydrated with water and limit refined sugars to avoid energy crashes.\n",

    "content": "A René Magritte painting depicting an eerily lit streetscape sold for more than $121 million at a Christie’s auction in New York on Tuesday –– surpassing its $95 million estimate and smashing the auction record for the Surrealist artist’s work.\nAs one of the largest paintings in a succession of 27 works all titled “L’empire des lumières” (“The Empire of Light”), the 1954 canvas is well known among 20th century art experts for its scale, pristine condition and subtle details.\nThe auction house described the artwork as the “crown jewel” of its former owner, the late American interior designer Mica Ertegun’s, collection –– part of which went on sale Tuesday. The auction also featured paintings by other modern giants like Ed Ruscha and Max Ernst.\nThe artwork depicts a house with a single streetlamp in front. The flame from the lamp lights up the entire canvas, including the dark trees –– almost black in color –– in the foreground, while the image is serenely reflected over a pool of water. Above the streetscape, a light blue sky dotted with puffy white clouds stretches to the top of the canvas.\nThe painting has been praised for its unique ability to juxtapose a nocturnal landscape and daylight –– a surrealist motif that Magritte explored in his landscape paintings for almost two decades.\n“The motif is one of the few truly iconic images in 20th century art and the painting, particularly the sky and flickering light in the foreground,” said Max Carter, Christie’s Vice Chairman of 20th to 21st Century Art, in an email to CNN prior to the sale, adding that the work has an “extraordinary glow in person.”\nThe selling price, which smashed estimates, marks a bright spot amid a slowdown in global art sales and an art market marred by economic uncertainties.\n“When icons appear on the market, they create their own market dynamic,” Carter said.\nTwo other Magritte works were included in the sale: The paintings “La cour d’amour” and “La Mémoire,” which sold for $10.53 million and $3.68 million, respectively. Elsewhere, a still life by 87-year-old British artist David Hockney fetched over $19 million.\nAccording to Art Basel and UBS’s 2024 Survey of Global Collecting, public auction sales at Christie’s totaled $2.1 billion in the first half of this year –– down 22% the same period last year –– marking the second consecutive year of declining first-half sales.\nChristie’s however saw some uplifts in 2024, including in its sale of Asian art as well as total online sales, which recorded a 3% year-on-year increase in global share of bids since 2023.\nA recent 20th and 21st century art sale in Hong Kong saw works by Claude Monet and Vincent van Gogh fetching prices close to and below estimates –– a sign that buyers are still cautious.\nThough perhaps best known for his surrealist depictions of bowler hat-wearing men, Magritte spent a period of 15 years exploring the fleeting transition from day to night in landscape painting. He produced a total of 17 oil paintings and 10 gouaches (water-based paintings) that all share the name “L’empire des lumières” –– and each with small alternations between versions.\nThe paradoxical paintings rose in demand, particularly when a large version created in 1954 was featured in the Belgian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale and was sold to famed collector Peggy Guggenheim. Magritte went on to create three similarly large canvases — including the one that sold Tuesday — that same year so as not to disappoint other collectors.\nWhen asked about the comparatively subtle surrealism of the “L’empire des Lumières” works, Sandra Zalman, an art history associate professor at the University of Houston, argued that the lamppost was an early iteration of the iconic bowler-hat man.\n“The lamppost’s shadow alludes to the bowler-hatted man, hovering — or haunting — the space that would otherwise be considered a quiet, though eerie, landscape,” she said, in an email.\nZalman added that the timing of the sale is also fitting –– not just because it coincides with the centennial of the surrealism movement, but that it’s taking place during a “surreal moment in history to be living through.”\n“I would also argue that the surrealists’ own time was equally anxiety-ridden,” Zalman said. “There are almost too many parallels.”\n",

    "content": "“All we have to have is just a human form to be a victim.” That’s how lawyer Carrie Goldberg describes the risk of deepfake porn in the age of artificial intelligence.\nWhile revenge porn — or the nonconsensual sharing of sexual images — has been around for nearly as long as the internet, the proliferation of AI tools means that anyone can be targeted by this form of harassment, even if they’ve never taken or sent a nude photo. Artificial intelligence tools can now superimpose a person’s face onto a nude body, or manipulate existing photos to make it look as if a person is not wearing clothes.\nIn the past year, targets of AI-generated, nonconsensual pornographic images have ranged from prominent women like Taylor Swift and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to high school girls.\nFor someone discovering that they, or their child, have been made the subject of deepfake porn, the experience is typically scary and overwhelming, said Goldberg, who runs the New York-based firm C.A. Goldberg Law representing victims of sex crimes and online harassment. “Especially if they’re young and they don’t know how to cope and the internet is this big, huge, nebulous place,” she said.\nBut there are steps that targets of this form of harassment can take to protect themselves and places to turn for help, Goldberg told me in an interview on CNN’s new tech podcast, Terms of Service with Clare Duffy.\nTerms of Service aims to demystify the new and emerging technologies that listeners encounter in their daily lives. (You can listen to the full conversation with Goldberg here.)\nGoldberg said that for people targeted by AI-generated sexual images, the first step — however counterintuitive — should be to screenshot them.\n“The knee-jerk reaction is to get this off the internet as soon as possible,” Goldberg said. “But if you want to be able to have the option of reporting it criminally, you need the evidence.”\nNext, they can seek out the forms that platforms like Google, Meta and Snapchat provide to request removal of explicit images. Nonprofit organizations like StopNCII.org and Take It Down can also help facilitate the removal of such images across multiple platforms at once, although not all sites cooperate with the groups.\nA bipartisan group of senators sent an open letter in August calling on nearly a dozen tech firms, including X and Discord, to join the programs.\nThe fight to address nonconsensual explicit images and deepfakes has received rare bipartisan support. A group of teens and parents who had been affected by AI-generated porn testified at a hearing on Capitol Hill, where Republican Sen. Ted Cruz introduced a bill — supported by Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar and others — that would make it a crime to publish such images and require social media platforms to remove them upon notice from victims.\nBut, for now, victims are left to navigate a patchwork of state laws. In some places, there are no criminal laws preventing the creation or sharing of explicit deepfakes of adults. (AI-generated sexual images of children typically fall under child sexual abuse material laws.)\n“My proactive advice is really to the would-be offenders which is just, like, don’t be a total scum of the earth and try to steal a person’s image and use it for humiliation,” Goldberg said. “There’s not much that victims can do to prevent this … We can never be fully safe in a digital society, but it’s kind of up to one another to not be total a**holes.”\n",

And it blew up from there.\"\nAnd while the question was straightforward, it had a positively enormous response, with her clip racking up almost 10 million views and half a million likes in just two days.\n\"It looks like it's layered, but like what is it layered with?\" Taylor asked about the \"perfect and shiny\" look of the stars' legs.\nThousands of TikTok users rushed to comment the answer, and while some simply insisted the stars were wearing tights or pantyhose, other answers were more detailed.\n\"Any competitive dancer knows the answer to this question,\" one user wrote, as another explained it was \"Capezio shimmer tights.\"\nGiving more information, one said Swift was \"also wearing the Capezio fishnets over the shimmer versions. \"They are dance tights so they are built to withstand tons of movement,\" they explained.\nA dance teacher commented: \"I always forget normal people have no clue Capezio tights exist! These are the shimmer tights with suntan color fishnet tights over them.\"\nCapezio is a brand favored by multiple celebrities. Beyoncé said in a 2010 interview on The View that she wore four pairs of stockings at once, to keep everything tight as she danced on stage.\nDespite being the choice of billionaire Swift, the Capezio tights won't break the bank for more ordinary folk: ultra-shimmery tights are available on its site for just $15.\nThe tights company wrote in an Instagram post in 2023 that its professional fishnet tights were \"worn by dancers, performers and celebrities alike,\" thanks to the their \"incredible stretch and hold.\"\nAnd in 2022 the brand shared a snap of Swift on stage and revealed she was wearing its Ultra Shimmery Tights and Professional Fishnet Tights together—to which one commenter replied: \"Capezio is a Swiftie confirmed.\"\nThere are many reasons performers choose to wear tights, particularly when it comes to dancing. As well as professional brands offering unhindered mobility, tight-fitting clothes can improve blood circulation in the legs, reducing muscle fatigue after a performance, according to the Dance Innovations Dance Center.\nDo you have funny and adorable videos or pictures you want to share?

    "content": "Back when I was a young and inexperienced reporter at Newsday, on Long Island, I was assigned the courts beat in Suffolk County. It was considered by editors at the paper to be both an entry-level beat, but also one that produced big stories that ran for weeks in the paper.\nOne morning in the winter of 1979, I got a call from an assistant district attorney who, in so many words, said: \"Today will be very interesting. Make sure you stick around.\" He mentioned a particular courtroom I should be in at a certain time.\nSo I went. I took a seat in the front row, just behind the rail that separated the well of the court from the spectator area.\nI can't remember today exactly what time it was that morning, but all of a sudden the double doors to the hallway swung open and officers escorted in a middle-aged man, his hands cuffed behind his back.\nHe was tall and muscular, with long arms that ran down to overly large hands. I could see that as he walked a few feet away from my seat. He had a full head of graying hair and a face that looked like a road map to a failed life.\nWhile he was in his late fifties, he looked much older. He had the worn look of a man who'd been around the block a few times, someone who sat on a bar stool night after night and drank himself into oblivion.\nHis name was Rudolph Hoff. He lived on Grand Avenue in Lindenhurst, a small village on the South Shore of Suffolk County.\nStanding before the judge, he was arraigned on a murder charge in the exceedingly violent, mutilation murder of a 52-year-old housewife from Lindenhurst named Kathryn Ann Damm.\nWhile that charge was, in itself, not unusual in a criminal courtroom, what was astonishing was when the murder took place—October 1954. I heard the assistant tell the judge this was the oldest cold case in New York State. This made me sit up.\nA million questions went through my head: Why now, 25 years later, was he arrested? What evidence could there be after all this time? Who was the woman he allegedly killed?\nOver the coming weeks, day after day in the courtroom, I sat listening to testimony. On October 2, 1954, the last game of the World Series between the New York Giants and the Cleveland Indians was played. The Giants won all four games and the Series.\nThe Lindenhurst bar where Hoff sat and where he met his victim was a dive joint tight to the railroad tracks called the Alcove Bar and Grill. A radio that sat on the bar under the long lines of gin and whisky bottles blared out the games to a crowd of blue collar laborers and, like Hoff himself, German immigrants.\nJournalistically, the story was a reporter's gift: A gruesome murder in a small village, layered with the mystery of why no arrest was made at the time. The drama of the witnesses who took the stand added to the mystery.\nEven the World Series added drama to the story. In the first game of the Series, the Wednesday before the murder, Willie Mays made a famous catch on the warning track while running at full speed. He spun around and threw to home plate, blocking a Cleveland victory.\nI could picture the scene in the Alcove as the announcer shouted out what had just happened on the field that would forever be immortalized as \"the Catch.\"\nAt one point during the trial, it looked to me that the prosecution would not get a conviction. The long delay in making an arrest was too big a mountain to climb.\nMaking it worse, the judge, Robert Doyle, tossed Hoff's confession to police, saying it was made without a lawyer being present. There was not much left after that.\nThen the bombshell went off. On another day when I was sitting in the front row, the double doors burst open once again and a tall, lanky woman, her hair braided down her back, entered the courtroom escorted by a detective.\nShe walked through the gate into the well of the court, and right past Hoff's seat at the defendant's table.\nI watched him as he turned to see who it was. His face dropped.\nRight before my eyes, and the eyes of everyone in the courtroom, he sank into shock. It was as if a ghost had appeared before him. I could have cut the tension in the room with a butter knife.\nHoff was looking at his ex-wife, Gurli Hoff. And he knew what she knew when she took the stand. In her German-tinged accent, she told a story that—like Willie Mays' catch— was incredible.\nOn the night of the murder, after midnight, she awoke to the sounds of water running in the bathroom. Without knocking, she opened the door—to see her husband washing a large amount of blood off his arms and clothes. He ordered her to wash the bloody clothes and he went to bed.\nHoff was a violent man. That was clear at his trial. He radiated menace on the day he was first brought into the courtroom and walked by my seat.\nGurli Hoff divorced him later, knowing that he was guilty of the murder of the woman whose body was found in a field north of Lindenhurst Village.\nShe washed the bloody clothes that night, but she took the bloody belt, put it in a jar, and buried it in the backyard.\nOn her day to testify, she told this astonishing story and the jury convicted Hoff. Judge Doyle sent him upstate for a life sentence.\nBefore Hoff left the Suffolk County Jail for the ride in a caged van to an upstate prison, I asked the sheriff if I could speak with him. The sheriff set aside a secure room in the jail and Hoff and I sat down at a table, he in handcuffs, me writing on a yellow legal pad.\nHe, of course, proclaimed his innocence. He insisted he was framed by an ex-wife who hated him. Then, out of nowhere, he launched into a story about his German-born mother, who lived in the Bronx, and her friendship with another German-born woman named Anna Hauptmann. I had no idea what he was talking about.\nAnna Hauptmann was the wife of Richard Hauptmann, the German immigrant and carpenter who was tried and convicted for the 1932 kidnapping and murder of the toddler son of Charles Lindbergh in what was hailed by the press as \"The Crime of the Century.\" The State of New Jersey executed Hauptmann in the electric chair on April 3, 1936.\nI was not following Hoff as he launched into how Richard Hauptmann was framed and \"murdered\" by New Jersey. Why was he talking about this case at all?\nIn February 1981, I wrote a magazine piece for Newsday about the Hoff case. By then, more information had come out about Hoff, directly addressing the question of why he was not arrested in 1954 when everything pointed to him. He was even questioned and released days after the discovery of Damm's body.\nIt turned out, in a twist more fitting in a detective novel, that Gurli Hoff had a close relationship with her neighbor, a man named Jack Holmgren, who was a sergeant in the Babylon, Long Island, Town Police Department. He later became a high-ranking member of the Suffolk County Police Department.\nWhile working in Babylon, he had been involved in the investigation of the Damm case. He knew the details—and he shared some of them with a Hoff family member, including telling him that the phone in Hoff's house was tapped. He told the family member to tell Hoff to make calls from another house.\nHolmgren retired from the Suffolk County Police Department in 1972. He died on January 26, 1979—the very day Hoff was picked up for questioning and later arrested for the savage murder of Kathryn Ann Damm. I didn't see this timing as a coincidence.\nI did not envision writing a true crime book about the Hoff case. My first book was true crime: Bad Company: Drugs, Hollywood and The Cotton Club Murder.\nI knew working on that book how hard it is to find enough material—through interviews, through court records and other primary source documents—to write a solid work of nonfiction about a real-life murder.\nStill, the Hoff story stayed with me. Increasing my interest was Hoff's out-of-the-blue reference to Richard Hauptmann and the Lindbergh case.\nI read many books about the Lindbergh case and came away with the conviction that Hauptmann could not possibly have, on his own, gone to a remote part of New Jersey, put a makeshift, poorly-constructed ladder against a second-floor window in Lindbergh's mansion, climbed up, crawled through the window, removed the child from his crib, crawled back out the window, and down the ladder. The child's battered body was later found by a road not far from the mansion.\nThe mansion was fully occupied on the night of the removal of the child. Lindbergh and his wife were there, as were staff members. A dog was also present. Whoever was behind the crime knew which window on the second floor was that of the nursery.\nIt surely was not a lucky guess on the part of the kidnapper, who could certainly see the house was occupied, as to which window in the mansion was the nursery.\nAnd how did the supposed kidnapper enter the nursery, and remove the child, without leaving any physical evidence such as fingerprints or mud from his shoes—anything, really—in the room?\nEven the handoff of ransom money in a Bronx cemetery to a Lindbergh associate sounded absurd, with Lindbergh later testifying that he heard Hauptmann's voice.\nTo my mind, and to so many others, the prosecution wanted first and foremost to appease Lindbergh, a gigantic cultural figure of the day, and get a conviction in a death penalty case.\nMany of the books I read used the word \"framed\" when discussing the conviction and execution. To this day, exactly what happened in that house on a night in the winter of 1932 remains a mystery.\nIt's hard to look at the case without seeing someone in the house as being directly-involved in the removal of the child. The whole episode that night has a coordinated feel to it.\nAnd then there's Lindbergh himself. This American \"hero,\" as so many saw him, had loud pro-Nazi sympathies in the 1930s, helped lead the \"American First\" movement before the onset of America's involvement in World War II in 1941, and blamed Jewish interests for wanting America to go to war against Germany.\nWithout a Hoff true crime book, my idea turned to writing about the case—changing names and other details—as a detective novel. Fiction, in other words. It would be set in post-war Lindenhurst in 1954.\nThe setting was perfect. Lindenhurst in the mid-1930s had a large German Bund chapter—pro-Hitler German-Americans who paraded down the village's main street in their Nazi uniforms and waving swastika flags.\nSurely, I could fit this into the plot. East of Lindenhurst on Long Island, in the hamlet of Yaphank, was a German Bund camp that featured large gatherings of Nazi sympathizers goosestepping around and shouting out their devotion to Hitler.\nAll this, I hoped, could fit into a novel. I created a detective, along with his German friend and Holocaust survivor who runs a funeral home in the village, as the main characters.\nAs a novelist, I had license to interpret facts, to, essentially, write my own version of the \"truth.\" I called the novel The Ruins.\nI had not written fiction before. I found it enormously challenging to go from journalism and three nonfiction books to the novel. There were many avenues to explore. As a fiction writer, perhaps I could explain why Hoff brought Hauptmann up when I spoke to him.\nWhile I was working on the novel, Hoff sent letters to me from his upstate prison, imploring me to drive upstate and visit him. I ignored them. He died in prison on October 22, 2008. He was 84 years old.\nThe Ruins, a first novel, began that day in 1979 when Rudolph Hoff was brought into the courtroom. Great stories have great beginnings.\nSteve Wick is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist. His first fiction book, The Ruins, will be releasing with Pegasus Crime on February 4, 2025. The novel is heavily inspired by the murder trial of Rudolph Hoff, which Steve covered extensively for Newsday in the 1980s.\nAll views expressed are the author's own.\nDo you have a unique experience or personal story to share?

Sean Manaea, Luis Severino and Jose Quintana were key contributors who are now free agents.\nWhile the Mets have been linked to several top pitchers since free agency began, will any of these guys make their way back to Queens for 2025 and beyond?\nStearns awarded just one multi-year deal to a big-league free agent last winter. It was a two-year, $28 million pact with Manaea. But he's back on the open market because that contract included an opportunity to opt out following 2024. The southpaw enjoyed an outstanding campaign in New York, posting a 12-6 record with a 3.47 ERA, 1.08 WHIP and 184 strikeouts in 181 2/3 innings.\nThe soon-to-be 33-year-old will get a larger guarantee than last winter. However, it'll be much easier for any club to manage his salary compared to what Corbin Burnes, Max Fried and Blake Snell are looking for. Deadspin's David Brown thinks Manaea will ultimately re-sign with the Mets on a three-year, $63 million deal.\nThat prediction just about mirrors his calculated market value from Spotrac, which is four years at $64.5 million. While not an insignificant amount of money, it could end up being a huge bargain for whichever team signs him.\nESPN's Dave Schoenfield shared his MLB free agency superlatives on Thursday, dubbing Manaea the player most likely to be the biggest steal.\n\"Manaea is ranked 10th on (Kiley) McDaniel's top-50 free agent ranking, but I like him over No. 9 Jack Flaherty or No. 11 Yusei Kikuchi based on the similar contract projections,\" he opined. \"And if Manaea is coming in at half the price as Max Fried and $100-something million lower than Corbin Burnes, that could make him the steal of free agency.\"\nMore MLB: MLB Execs Predict Juan Soto Signs $600-Plus Millions Deal With AL Team\n",

    "content": "The famously two-faced and litigious Elon Musk has brought his double standards on free speech and accountability to a new department in Washington created to increase \"government efficiency.\" What could go wrong?\nFor billionaire Musk, whose businesses already appear to be benefiting since the announcement—not much. But for those who want to ensure actual government accountability, it could be quite grim.\nDespite the words \"government\" and \"efficiency\" in its title, the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) will operate outside of government, with Musk and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy at the helm. So, while Donald Trump said the commission's goal will be to \"make the U.S. government accountable to 'WE THE PEOPLE,'\" the men in charge won't actually be accountable to anyone, as they will not be subject to standard ethics guidelines requiring disclosure of potential conflicts of interest (of which there are many here).\nThe creation of DOGE is an object example of Trump's intention to select people to run agencies they have publicly reviled, and are vocally eager to dismantle. \"We expect certain agencies to be deleted outright,\" Ramaswamy recently said. If the irony wasn't already thick enough, given Musk's own history of mocking and suppressing whistleblowers in his companies and blocking people who criticize him on X, the unseriousness of the newly formed agency is underlined by its acronym DOGE, which winks at Elon Musk's favorite meme, the Dogecoin (a cryptocurrency coin that was created as a joke).\nIn the Musk world view, transparency and accountability are entirely subjective. In March 2022, several weeks before launching his bid to buy Twitter, Musk declared himself a \"free speech absolutist.\" Nine months later, after completing the acquisition, Musk began banning prominent journalists from the platform. Companies that took their advertising dollars elsewhere were not seen as exercising their free will. Musk sued them, describing the companies' decision as a \"conspiracy\" and a \"boycott,\" and asking a federal court in Texas to prosecute them to the fullest.\nOn a more personal and dangerous level, Musk has repeatedly gone after individuals who criticize him. In October, he called for the prosecution of Victoria Nuland, the U.S. undersecretary of state for political affairs, insinuating that she (and not Russian President Vladimir Putin) was responsible for igniting the war in Ukraine. In a more chilling incident, Musk endorsed a tweet accusing ex-Twitter trust and safety exec, Yoel Roth, of being sympathetic to pedophilia, forcing Roth to move out of his home.\nAnd then there is Musk's treatment of Tesla whistleblowers, of which there are many. Cristina Balan, the early Tesla employee who raised safety concerns directly with Musk in 2020, and the two Tesla employees who filed safety concerns with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2021, were summarily terminated. More recently, there is the case of Lukasz Krupski, a Polish-born service technician who was injured putting out a fire at a Tesla delivery site in Norway, then leaked thousands of pages of internal accident data revealing the company's awareness of autopilot safety issues. Krupski told the BBC that whistleblowing on Tesla had been \"terrifying.\"\nMusk's vast personal and business entanglements in the federal government also draw into question Musk's claims that the commission will deliver \"maximum transparency.\" Tesla has benefited from government subsidies and some government contracts, but SpaceX is the real juggernaut. It has received over $19 billion in government contracts since 2008, according to FedScout. Via its Starlink satellite service, SpaceX has amply demonstrated its ability to shut down the internet at will. Given the taxpayer dollars at stake here, can we expect Musk to subject his own companies to the scrutiny promised by DOGE?\nIf government entities are to be run by people with such well-documented conflicts of interest, the task of ensuring their accountability will increasingly fall on ordinary citizens. Speaking up about violations of public trust takes enormous courage—even under the best of circumstances. To ensure that people of integrity can still sound the alarm about wrongdoing, we must increase protections for whistleblowers and create simple, transparent mechanisms for coming forward with public interest information.\nHaving worked with whistleblowers from Musk's own companies, we've learned that there is safety in numbers. By building systems that democratize whistleblowing—that make it possible for those who have observed wrongdoing to come forward with concerning information, even if they weren't in a position to observe the full picture—we can reduce individual risk, better protecting courageous fellow citizens while increasing the amount of public interest information that can make it to the world.\nThat said, DOGE appears to be hiring. Its newly created X account is inviting \"super high-IQ small-government revolutionaries willing to work 80+ hours per week\" to DM their resumes. If you're an intelligent person who believes the government should be transparent and accountable, perhaps you should apply. And if, during one of your 16-hour workdays, you observe something you believe the public should know, we'll be here to help.\nAmber Scorah and Rebecca Petras are co-founders of Psst.org.\nThe views expressed in this article are the writers' own.\n",

    "content": "Israel’s military has issued 1,126 arrest warrants for ultra-Orthodox conscripts who have not responded to drafting orders, in a move likely to fuel discontent over a controversial decision to remove their decades-long exemption from service.\nBrig. Gen. Shay Tayeb announced the arrest warrants to a parliamentary committee Tuesday, saying that conscripts who had ignored their orders would initially be called and reminded of their duty.\nThose who continued not to cooperate, he said, would be summoned immediately or risk being declared a draft dodger – after which they would be banned from foreign travel and risk arrest if stopped by police.\nThe move is likely to fuel the discontent that has roiled the country since a Supreme Court ruling in June that ultra-Orthodox Jews could not be exempt from military service, as they have been since the founding of Israel.\nIsrael has turned to enlisting ultra-Orthodox (or Haredi) Jews of draft age after more than a year of war in Gaza and a ground operation in Lebanon that has strained its military, but the move has been deeply unpopular with a community on whose support Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu relies for his governing coalition.\nRelated article\nUltra-Orthodox party in Israel urges young Haredi men to resist draft\nSince the Supreme Court ruling, Israeli authorities have sent out 3,000 draft orders to ultra-Orthodox Jews and new Defense Minister Israel Katz said last week he would send out an additional 7,000 orders that were approved by his predecessor Yoav Gallant before he was fired two weeks ago.\nHowever, in his comments Tuesday, Brig. Gen. Tayib cautioned that even 10,000 ultra-Orthodox conscripts might not be enough.\n“The IDF is in need of soldiers. We touched on the figure of 10,000, but this isn’t a stable figure because we have casualties unfortunately,” he said.\nOn Tuesday, Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid called on Katz to “act immediately” to issue the additional draft orders and to “expand the enforcement towards those who didn’t show up.”\n“This is a test revealing who stands with the combat troops and who stands with the draft dodgers,” he posted on X.\nAnger had been simmering among the ultra-Orthodox community even before the news of the arrest warrants.\nOn Sunday, scuffles broke out between police and ultra-Orthodox protesters in Bnei Brak, east of Tel Aviv. Reuters footage shows protesters holding signs reading: “It is better to die a religious Jew than to live as a secular Jew” and “Death rather than draft.”\n“Our youth are demonstrating because the Israeli government wants to (recruit) our religious people to the army,” said protester Yona Kaye.\n“Our history is full of Jews who have given up their lives in order to remain religious,” Kaye added. “We will die. We will stay extended periods of time in jail but not go to the Israeli army, which means to become irreligious.”\nRelated article\nUltra-Orthodox Jewish protesters attack Israeli minister’s car amid anger at military draft ruling\nSuch protests highlight a fault line in Israeli society between ultra-Orthodox Jews and other Israelis, many of whom believe that all Jewish citizens should serve in the military, especially during wartime.\nMany Haredi men spend much of their early lives out of the workforce, instead studying at religious schools known as yeshivas that are partly funded through government subsidies.\nFor many Haredis, the idea that they would be pulled from studying scripture and drafted into Israel’s military is simply out of the question.\nAn arrangement made during Israel’s founding exempted several hundred Haredi men from conscription. However, the community has since grown exponentially, allowing tens of thousands of ultra-Orthodox men to now avoid the draft.\n",

    "content": "ESPN's Jesse Rogers recently did a poll of 18 MLB executives and insiders where he asked a plethora of different questions. One of those questions asked where Chicago White Sox ace Garrett Crochet would be traded this winter, if he was traded at all.\nFive of the 18 experts predicted he would land with the New York Mets, leading them way over the other top trade destinations.\nAnd it makes sense. The Mets are looking to replace multiple starting pitchers this winter and they can't add too many aces in free agency. So why not try to acquire an ace in a trade while adding another one through free agency?\nHere's a trade proposal that would send Crochet to the Big Apple:\nThis deal would be centered around two top-ten prospects in New York's organization: Ryan Clifford and Ronny Mauricio.\nClifford, 21, has clubbed 45 home runs in 269 career pro-ball games. He has elite raw power and he's ranked in the top ten of a good Mets farm system for a reason.\nMauricio spent time in the big leagues last season where he showed flashes of serious potential. It would be hard for the Mets to get rid of him, but while they're looking at some big-time talent in free agency, Mauricio may not have an open lane to start in 2025.\nBaro is a bit of a lottery ticket prospect. He has a few good tools, like his speed and his hit tool, but he's about average across the board.\nThe White Sox are looking to add position players in their farm system. The Mets have a lot of top position players in their system to send in this deal, so some of these names could be interchangeable in the actual deal.\nAdding Crochet would be huge for the Mets. This would allow them to sign Juan Soto and still pick up an ace. If they don't land Soto, they could still land a pitcher like Corbin Burnes or Blake Snell and still have plenty of room for Crochet.\nMore MLB: Phillies Receiving Trade Interest From Royals For $8 Million All-Star Infielder\n",

    "content": "President Joe Biden will try to push through more federal student loan forgiveness before he leaves office, this time targeting those who face significant financial hardships.\nBiden this week announced two income-driven repayment plans for borrowers to work towards the end of their debt or even full loan forgiveness on a 20- to 25-year timeline under the Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) and Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) plans.\nOn Friday, the Biden administration continued its big push to get in as much debt relief established as possible before the second Trump administration starts by announcing a new waiver on student loan debts in which the bower has experienced or is experiencing hardship related to their loan.\nThe new provision would define hardship as \"likely to impair the borrower's ability to fully repay the Federal government\" or \"renders the costs of enforcing the full amount of the debt\"—or, in other words, if the department determines that the borrower will most likely default on the loan, they'll wipe it out.\nOfficials will use a \"predictive assessment\" to provide Education Secretary Miguel Cardona with the information and allow him to exercise discretion to dispense this potential one-time relief \"as soon as practicable,\" according to the Federal Register.\nThe Department of Education (DOE) has determined that the proposed new measure would apply to between 2.67 million and 8 million borrowers. Meanwhile, during Biden's administration, the DOE has provided $175 billion in student loan forgiveness for roughly 5 million people.\nNewsweek reached out to the Department of Education (DOE) for comment by email on Saturday morning.\nThe Biden administration has made repeated attempts to broadly cancel federal student loan debts for various types of qualifying borrowers. President-elect Donald Trump during the debate with Vice President Kamala Harris in September attacked the administration for failing to deliver on their promises of cancellation, calling the plan a \"total catastrophe.\"\nTrump also said that the plan to outright cancel debt for millions of American would prove \"unfair\" for the millions of others who did repay their loans.\nCourts have struck down a number of Biden's previous efforts to cancel student debt, including the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, which remains in a state of uncertainty as the courts consider challenges to the policy.\nDue to the challenges to SAVE, the administration reintroduced the PAYE and ICR plans as stand-alone measures. A DOE spokesperson previously told Newsweek that the move allows borrowers to continue making progress on repayment while SAVE remains in legal limbo.\n\"The interim final rule ensures the Department can meet its statutory obligation under the Higher Education Act to let borrowers make payments on an income contingent repayment plan,\" the spokesperson said. \"It does this through a stopgap measure that reopens enrollment for borrowers in two other repayment plans, Income Contingent Repayment (ICR) and Pay As You Earn (PAYE). We will provide more information when the Department is ready to begin enrolling new borrowers in these plans.\"\nThe first Trump administration tried to increase monthly payments on student loans from 10 to 12.5 percent of borrowers' discretionary income and wanted to merge all income-driven repayment plans into one simplified plan.\nWith Trump back in office, it's likely his administration would push to dismantle the SAVE plan and potentially legally challenge the remaining forgiveness plans in place, Michael Ryan, a finance expert and the founder of michaelryanmoney.com, previously told Newsweek.\n",

    "content": "\"Democrats are evil.\" These words are etched on a wooden plank—perched against the windowsill of a house in the sleepy beachside town of El Segundo, California—where I am raising my kids, my home for the last eight years.\nI have struggled with how dehumanizing the language of both parties has become in these last few years—imperialists, colonialists, terrorists, illegals. Evil.\nI was once asked if I believed in evil during a medical school interview in New York City, soon after the attacks on September 11.\nThat same year, my father and his friends were perceived as terrorists by a fellow passenger on a plane. An engineer by training, my dad had sponsored a few artists from India to put on a cultural show in the United States, and his friends were trained musicians and actors. This was a passion project of his. A woman on the plane noted their lively speech in a language that was foreign to her.\nMy Americanness—my origin story—has been a question mark for those who see me and remain unknowing. But I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge that I have engaged in my own othering, my own creation of unknowing.\nMy tendency to other is a part of my evolving identity. In the words of the gender scholar Judith Butler: \"We're both formed, and we form ourselves, and that's a living paradox.\"\nI identified as a Democrat as early as age 12 when, on our way to a marching band event in New Jersey, I \"debated\" my best friend on abortion, with my nascent pro-choice perspective. Neither of my immigrant parents offered me their own party preference to shape my view, but they did instill in me a deep commitment to service and the ideal of a shared humanity.\nNow in my mid-40s, I still hold certain values close—the right to choose when you have a family, the right to have healthcare, the right to have access to clean water, food, and shelter. I have become jaded by the talk from those in my own party who claim to hold those same values but remain committed to maintaining the wealth gap.\nWe live in the \"blue\" state of California where we did not pass a proposition to increase the minimum wage, where housing prices and rent remain unconscionably inflated, where those sleeping on the street are literally swept away so that those with privilege can remain blind to those without.\nI remain wary of those who share many of the values I hold yet engage in name-calling and are selective about their cries against human rights violations. They—like some of my Republican counterparts—continue to create narratives of good versus evil, us versus them, oppressed versus oppressors.\nEvil as a noun, evil as an adjective. When asked if I believed in it 23 years ago, I struggled with my response. Some may say it was a problem that I was asked such a question. Today, I understand its simplicity. It is easy to fall into the good-versus-evil plotline. It feels comfortable and familiar. It is an allegory in nearly every religious text.\nIt plays out every day in my work as a physician.\nAs I carefully press on my patient's abdomen, looking for new signs of disease, he interrupts the moment—expressing joy at watching a news report of a battle perceived to be won in the Middle East. This same story is also playing out in his body as he engages in battle with his metastatic cancer and the difficult infection that I am treating.\nIn the battle narrative of illness, there are those who win and those who lose. It is an imperfect metaphor in cancer because it undermines the power of the life lost.\nIt is a false narrative in actual war because it erases the stories of the lives who, in its wake, continue to suffer starvation, disease, and death.\nOne of the great epics from my childhood—The Mahabharata—centers a battle between two groups of cousins, one ostensibly good, the other evil. As you read through the text, you see that evil is defined not as the person but by action, and inaction—and in fact, in times of despair, all are vulnerable to challenging the moral good.\nI look into my patient's kind eyes. I take in the crucifix on his chest, his faith in his doctors' work. We are of different religions, different skin tones, different political perspectives. He is my neighbor, my patient—and on this clear blue day in Los Angeles, where the mountains rise crisply behind the skyscrapers—we are united in our craving for a good tandoori chicken meal and our singular mission to maintain a shared humanity.\nWe are citizens who seek refuge under the same multilayered fabric—this pluralistic city, state, and country we call home. I look at his wife, who looks at me with hope. I squeeze his hand. He squeezes back.\nTara Vijayan is a physician based in Los Angeles.\nAll views expressed are the author's own.\nDo you have a unique experience or personal story to share?

    "content": "Newsweek's core mission is to provide our readers with a deep and nuanced understanding of the world around them. That means embracing a truly global perspective. We aim to transcend surface-level narratives, offering coverage that creates opportunities for true international dialogue.\nTo many, the 21st century is also known as the Asian Century. Asia will lead the world in this next phase of global economic growth. According to Goldman Sachs, by 2050, the world's GDP will be $227.9 trillion. Asia will represent the largest share of global GDP growth at $90.6 trillion, followed by the developed economies at $82.9 trillion and then the rest of the world.\nOur recent exclusive interviews with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, masterfully conducted by our team led by Global Editor-in-Chief Nancy Cooper, are the latest example of this commitment. In this context, I see our role at Newsweek as not merely passive observers but as active facilitators of meaningful dialogue around the future of Asia.\nAs an American who was born and lived the early part of my life in India, I have a nuanced perspective on India's challenges and aspirations. The country's relatively nascent sovereignty, having emerged only 75 years ago from centuries of colonial rule, is a testament to its resilience. The journey from its colonial past to a vibrant democracy is a narrative I hold close to my heart, and it drives my commitment to ensure that Newsweek covers India with the depth and nuance it deserves.\nCoverage of India by mainstream international media at times gravitates toward simplistic narratives that fail to capture the profound complexity and vibrant diversity of the world's most populous nation. Typically, the portrayal emphasizes either the booming IT and economic sectors or the persistent challenges such as poverty and social friction, leaving little room for the varied perspectives beyond and in between.\nSuch coverage can overlook the rich cultural tapestry, the internal innovations in various sectors, and the distinct political dynamics, all shaped by thousands of years of history, that today stand at the nexus of geopolitical change. The level of optimism and pride I'm seeing among Indians—friends, family, and colleagues—is truly inspiring and unlike anything I've experienced before. The global stage is set to witness a confident India, and if the Indian diaspora's contribution to the U.S., the UK, and elsewhere is a preview, the world stands to gain much from India's rising prominence.\nThat's why Newsweek's interview with Prime Minister Modi and the associated story was not just a recitation of current events: Our coverage delved into the complex dynamics of India's geopolitical relationships and their broader implications for global affairs.\nModi's remarks to Newsweek on the Indo-China border disputes and his call for urgent resolution resonated globally, sparking reactions from major geopolitical players, including a direct response from the Chinese government. The response was immediate and extensive, with major news outlets like Bloomberg and BBC amplifying the discussion. The reaction from China was particularly significant, and its Foreign Ministry spokesperson highlighted hopes for diplomatic progress. This international engagement underscores the relevance of Newsweek's efforts and reaffirms our role in fostering meaningful global dialogue.\nA few weeks after our interview with Prime Minister Modi, we met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo. There, too, we gained fresh insights into the thoughts of a significant national leader and his approach to his country's challenges and opportunities.\nThe interview explored the country's pressing need for stronger partnerships with the U.S. and other regional allies to address what he described as \"the most challenging and complex security environment since the end of World War II,\" a situation exacerbated by recent military activities by China and North Korea. Throughout the interview, he frequently emphasized the term \"peace,\" underscoring Japan's intent to be assertive yet remain a peace-loving nation, obeying international rules.\nIt's our view that building a successful digital media company with global relevance today involves understanding political, economic, and social dynamics and committing to comprehensive reporting that resonates at the global stage and captures the evolution of the global order. In that respect, our recent India and Japan coverage serves as a kind of blueprint for Newsweek's global future. The impact of our interviews with Prime Minister Modi and Prime Minister Kishida and the accompanying stories highlights the critical role of media in international relations and democracy, reinforcing our commitment to journalism that not only reports but also enlightens.\n",

    "content": "Walgreens Boots Alliance, the parent company of British retailer Boots, has seen its stock decline during a turbulent week after facing backlash over its allegedly \"woke\" Christmas advert.\nThe stock closed Friday at $8.48, down 3.75 percent from Thursday, continuing a broader downward trend. Walgreens-Boots shares are down 66 percent over the past year and trading at their lowest since 1996.\nLast week, Boots stirred conservative anger after releasing its Christmas commercial featuring actor Adjoa Andoh as Mrs. Claus and a scene referencing gender-inclusive pronouns, where Mrs. Claus uses they/them pronouns when referring to one gift recipient.\nNewsweek has contacted Walgreens-Boots Alliance via email for comment.\nAndoh was the subject of criticism in 2023, when she said King Charles III's coronation ceremony was \"terribly white.\" She made the comments during British channel ITV's coverage of the coronation.\nBroadcast regulator Ofcom received over 8,000 complaints about the comment, but decided not to take action.\nFollowing Andoh's inclusion in the Boots ad, many online critics have accused the company of promoting \"woke\" values and promised to boycott the brand over Christmas.\nDarren Grimes, a presenter on conservative British television channel GB News, posted on X, formerly Twitter, \"Look at the share price of Boots since their Christmas ad came out with the 'terribly white' race baiting actress. People power.\" The post garnered 631,000 views by Sunday morning.\nAnother user @InevitableWest, a self-described \"Defender of Western values and culture,\" who has 61,800 followers on the site, also made a link between the advert and the stock price.\nIn a Friday X post, the user wrote, \"BREAKING: Walgreens Boots Alliance inc's (owner of Boots UK) has had $800 MILLION WIPED from their share capital following anti-white advert. Go woke, go BROKE. This is just the start.\" The post was viewed 2.6 million times by Sunday morning.\nWhile the drop coincides with the backlash, the stock has been declining in value for several years.\nIn October, Walgreens announced plans to shut down around 1,200 stores in the U.S. over the next three years in an attempt to overcome the $3-billion loss it recorded in its latest quarterly report.\nNo direct link between the ad and Walgreens-Boots stock performance has been confirmed.\nThe calls to abandon Boots this Christmas echo earlier conservative boycotts of American brands, where \"Go Woke, Go Broke,\" was a common rallying cry.\nThese have included the high-profile backlash against Bud Light in 2023 after the beer brand partnered with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. Bud Light's sales fell, and its parent company, Anheuser-Busch InBev, saw a drop in stock value.\nConservative influencers have continued to apply this pressure to other companies, with recent boycotts targeting Dunkin' Donuts, Harley Davidson, and Tractor Supply for their apparent support of progressive causes.\n",

    "content": "Week 11 saw late drama, blowout wins and surprising upsets as the 2024 NFL season’s playoff picture became a little bit clearer.\nThere was a huge result in the AFC as the Buffalo Bills handed the Kansas City Chiefs their first defeat of the season.\nHere are the main storylines from Sunday’s action.\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens have historically been the dominant forces in the AFC North. But Sunday’s clash held extra weight with the division title potentially on the line.\nBoth teams had seven wins heading into their Week 11 clash at Acrisure Stadium in the Steel City with different reasons to be optimistic.\nThe Ravens had the NFL’s No. 1 scoring offense while the Steelers had the No. 2 scoring defense with Pittsburgh’s offense improving week-by-week with Russell Wilson at the helm.\nAnd although it wasn’t pretty, the Steelers managed to find a way to edge past Baltimore, with all their points coming via the foot of kicker Chris Boswell – who hit six field goals – in an 18-16 victory.\nWhile Pittsburgh’s offense struggled to convert drives into touchdowns, it was left to their defense to slow Lamar Jackson, Derrick Henry and company.\nAnd they did so admirably, holding Baltimore’s offense to two touchdowns – one coming late in the fourth quarter – and a season-low 329 total yards, as well as forcing three turnovers.\nIt was a big game personally for Pittsburgh linebacker Patrick Queen who swapped the purple and black of Baltimore for the black and gold of the Steelers in the offseason after the Ravens deemed him surplus to requirements.\nQueen led the Steelers in tackles, as well as forcing a fumble and recovering the ball himself which led to a field goal to give his team a 9-7 lead at halftime.\n“Well, look, this morning I had no hatred in my heart,” Queen told NFL Network’s Cameron Wolfe after the game. “I just wanted to come out here and do what I do and do what I do best.\n“The first drive, I was kind of feeling it a little bit. (Steelers linebacker Nick Herbig) made a huge play, and it just came out of me playing football, all the emotions. … I just wanted to go out there and put on a show.”\nWhile the win cements the Steelers’ spot atop the AFC North, on the other hand, it was an uncharacteristically sloppy performance from the Ravens as they fell to 7-4.\nJackson looked out of sorts trying to decipher Pittsburgh’s defense, NFL rushing leader Henry fumbled the ball on the team’s first possession of the game, the usually reliable Justin Tucker missed two field goals and the team was generally hampered by penalties, incurring 12 throughout the game.\nAfter the defeat, head coach John Harbaugh said his team “definitely” has to address the issue of penalties, while Jackson highlighted the squad’s poor starts to drives.\n“I believe we had a lot of slow starts, if anything, a lot of penalties (and) three turnovers. Stuff like that, we can’t have in these types of games,” he told reporters. “This environment, knowing it’s a division game that’s still a Raven rivalry. It’s the one who has more possessions of the ball and keeping it safe, and we didn’t do a good job of that.”\nIt’s been a hugely successful season for the Detroit Lions so far. And that continued in unequivocal fashion on Sunday as they emphatically beat the Jacksonville Jaguars 52-6 at Ford Field.\nIn what was an extremely one-sided affair, Detroit scored on nearly every possession they had, totaling a franchise-best 645 yards on offense.\nQuarterback Jared Goff bounced back from having five interceptions in Week 10 with a perfect passer rating against the Jags, throwing for 412 yards and four touchdowns.\nIt is the fifth time this season Goff has had a completion percentage of at least 80% in a game – the most by a player in a single season in league history, per the NFL.\nAmon-Ra St. Brown had 11 receptions for 161 yards and two touchdowns while his fellow wide receiver Jameson Williams had 124 yards and one score.\nThe Lions were also dominant running the football, totaling 196 yards on the ground, with 144 coming via Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery – the duo nicknamed ‘Sonic and Knuckles’ from the Sega video game franchise.\nMontgomery had two touchdowns and Gibbs ran for another, meaning the Lions have rushed for a touchdown in 24 consecutive games, including the postseason, the longest such streak in NFL history.\nDetroit didn’t punt all day and Goff was even able to be benched midway through the fourth quarter to protect him from injury such was the margin of victory. They became the first team since the 2007 New England Patriots to score a touchdown on each of its first seven drives of a game.\nThe big victory also saw the team join a select group in NFL history.\nThey are just the third team in the Super Bowl era with three wins of 35-or-more points in their first 10 games of a season alongside the 1969 Minnesota Vikings and the 1973 Atlanta Falcons.\nHaving also scored 52 points at home in a win against the Tennessee Titans in Week 8, the Lions are the second team since 1970 and fifth team all-time to score 50-or-more points in consecutive home games in a single season.\nThe win improves the Lions to 9-1 and is the first time in 90 years that the team has won nine of its first 10 games of a season since beginning the 1934 campaign 10-0.\nWhen asked afterwards if he believes his team could be among the best in NFL history, head coach Dan Campbell said: “I think we have that ability, I really do.\n“To me, we have everything that we need to be potent, and like I say, I feel like we’re well-rounded,” Campbell told reporters.\n“When you’re able to run the ball with the big boys up front, you’ve got a hammer like David (Montgomery), and you’ve got this electricity with (Jahmyr) Gibbs, and you’ve got (Jameson Williams) Jamo on the perimeter, and then you’ve got our rock (Amon-Ra) St. Brown who just continues to make plays – you put him anywhere you want to put him, and you need it, he’s got it.\n“And then running the whole show is (Jared) Goff. I think we can be dangerous. We have that ability because, really, we can play the game anyway we need to, as long as we’re on our stuff, we’re on our game, and we’re locked in, and we’re finishing. We can do that.”\nThe Los Angeles Chargers blew a 21-point third quarter lead but managed to escape with a victory over the Cincinnati Bengals, winning 34-27 to improve to 7-3 on the year.\nAfter a Chargers field goal to go up 27-6 in the third quarter, things unraveled for Los Angeles as quarterback Joe Burrow and the Bengals scored touchdowns on three straight offensive possessions to tie the game.\nBurrow connected with Ja’Marr Chase for two touchdowns and Tee Higgins for another to tie the game 27-27 with 12:21 left in the fourth quarter.\nChase’s first touchdown of the evening was his 40th career score, meaning he became just the third player in NFL history with 40 or more receiving touchdowns before the age of 25, per the NFL.\nHowever, the Bengals offense would stall out and be held scoreless for the remainder of the game. Cincinnati kicker Chase McLaughlin had two opportunities to give the Bengals the lead but missed field goal attempts of 48 and 51 yards.\nJustin Herbert and Los Angeles took advantage of the Bengals’ miscues, orchestrating a four-play, 84-yard drive to set up the go-ahead touchdown.\nHerbert connected with rookie wide receiver Ladd McConkey for gains of 28 and 27 yards, to get the Chargers to the Bengals 29-yard line. On the next play, Chargers running back JK Dobbins broke out for a 29-yard touchdown run with 18 seconds remaining to all but seal the victory.\nThe 26-year-old Herbert finished with 297 passing yards, two touchdown passes and 65 rushing yards.\n“Great win! Great team win,” Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh exclaimed after the game.\n“Just because we lost the momentum didn’t mean that they had it. The guys didn’t flinch, didn’t buckle, didn’t even stumble, just kept right at it and responded.”\nCincinnati had a chance to tie the game but a Burrow Hail Mary pass to Higgins was knocked out of his hands by Chargers safety Derwin James Jr.\n“It’s a tough one to end on going into the bye week,” Burrow said after the game. “I just think it was a tough loss, first half didn’t go our way, we fought back, had our opportunities to seal the deal and we didn’t.”\nWith the loss, the Bengals fall to 4-7 on the season and fall further out of playoff contention, sitting in third place in the AFC North behind the Steelers and Ravens.\nMeanwhile, the Chargers will host Baltimore on November 25, as Harbaugh will play against his brother John Harbaugh for the first time since returning to the NFL this season.\nAway vs. home (winners in bold)\nGreen Bay Packers 20-19 Chicago Bears\nJacksonville Jaguars 6-52 Detroit Lions\nLas Vegas Raiders 19-34 Miami Dolphins\nLos Angeles Rams 28-22 New England Patriots\nCleveland Browns 14-35 New Orleans Saints\nBaltimore Ravens 16-18 Pittsburgh Steelers\nMinnesota Vikings 23-13 Tennessee Titans\nIndianapolis Colts 28-27 New York Jets\nAtlanta Falcons 6-38 Denver Broncos\nSeattle Seahawks 20-17 San Francisco 49ers\nKansas City Chiefs 21-30 Buffalo Bills\nCincinnati Bengals 27-34 Los Angeles Chargers\n",

    "content": "Howard Lutnick, the Cantor Fitzgerald CEO who’s been tapped to run the US Commerce Department, has in recent years become a prominent cheerleader for Tether, the company behind one of the world’s biggest crypto assets.\nBut even by the standards of crypto — an alternative financial ecosystem in which some of the biggest frauds of the 21st century have taken place — Tether is a murky entity that has been dogged by investors’ concerns about its operations. It is effectively an unregulated, offshore bank that’s become a tent pole of the $3 trillion crypto industry.\nThe way it works, briefly: You give a buck to Tether and it gives you a digital token, the lowercase-T tether, that essentially functions as a digital US dollar in the crypto-verse.\nThe tether token is known as a stablecoin, a kind of crypto that was created to hold its value steady while others, like bitcoin and ether, swing wildly minute to minute. (Yes, even though they’re called crypto-currencies, they’re actually a garbage way to buy things.)\nWhile there’s a lot to say about the risks of tether, let’s focus for a moment the capital-T company that issues it and its No. 1 banker in the US, Lutnick.\nTether was founded a decade ago by Brock Pierce, a former child actor of “The Mighty Ducks” fame, and a former plastic surgeon named Giancarlo Devasini. The company is now one of the biggest players in crypto, with a daily trading volume that eclipses even bitcoin, the world’s most popular token. And like many companies in the largely unregulated space, it has come under regulatory and legal scrutiny.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last month that the federal government is investigating Tether for possible violations of sanctions and anti-money-laundering rules. Citing unnamed sources, the Journal wrote that prosecutors from the Manhattan US attorney’s office are investigating whether tether has been used by third parties to fund drug trafficking, terrorism and hacking. At the same time, it reported the Treasury Department was considering sanctioning Tether because of how many bad actors, including Hamas and Russian arms dealers, rely on its stablecoin.\nTether told the WSJ in a statement that any suggestion it was involved in criminal activity was “outrageous” and that the company works actively with law enforcement to combat illicit activity. Tether’s CEO also stated on X that “the allegations in the article are unequivocally false.”\nTether didn’t immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.\nThat was hardly the first crisis PR moment for the company, though. For years, questions had swirled about where Tether was stashing its billions of dollars in reserves. In 2021, Tether paid $61 million to New York authorities to settle charges that it was misrepresenting the assets that back its stablecoin (a big no-no that Tether chalked up to a communications oversight).\nQuestions have lingered in crypto circles about Tether’s reserves. The company is essentially an unregulated, offshore bank, untethered (as it were) from all those pesky reserve requirements and regulations that actual banks are subject to.\nBut Lutnick, a Bitcoin enthusiast whose Wall Street firm manages Tether’s stockpile of Treasury bills, has eagerly defended the stablecoin issuer.\n“There’s always been a lot of talk — ‘do they have it or not’ — so I’m … saying, we’ve seen it and they have it,” Lutnick told Bloomberg in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos in January.\nTo be sure, Lutnick’s oversight of the Commerce Department — where he’d primarily be tasked with implementing President-elect Donald Trump’s tariff and trade agenda — gives him less sway over crypto policies than an appointment to the Treasury would have.\nRepresentatives for Trump’s transition team didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nBut Lutnick certainly isn’t the only crypto booster in Trump’s orbit, and the president-elect himself has done a 180 on the sector, which he previously dismissed as a scam. That change of heart happened to coincide with crypto billionaires plowing millions of dollars into his reelection campaign.\nThe more exciting news for crypto fans is less about the crypto fans coming in than the crypto opponents who are leaving, namely the Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who aggressively fought the industry’s expansion in the United States.\nSince the decisive US election, bitcoin, a crypto market bellwether, has shot up more than 30%, bolstered by expectations that the regulatory stranglehold, as the industry sees it, is over.\n“All of us who are in the industry have a lot of conviction that the technology will be the foundation of the financial architecture of the future,” Faryar Shirzad, chief policy officer at Coinbase, told me last week. “It’s just been the hostility from the regulators that have held them back.”\n",

They were 'taken to safe places.' The authorities did not provide any other details.\"\nSiren also said: \"Earlier, the Russian defense ministry reported that 20 drones were shot down over the territory of the Novgorod region overnight. The governor of the region, Andrei Nikitin, also wrote about the destruction of 'several' drones.\"\nThe evacuations couldn't be independently verified by Newsweek. The Russian foreign ministry has been contacted via email for comment.\nThe strikes come after Ukraine's fight was boosted by a $275 million deal with the U.S., as well as Joe Biden's sign off on Ukraine using U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles to attack Russian territory.\nThe use of the long-range missiles is being seen as an escalation in the war by Russian politicians.\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has stated that the supply of these long-range missiles is a signal that the West is becoming more involved in the conflict, and one Russian lawmaker, State Duma deputy Andrei Gurulyov, said that if the U.S. keeps supplying these missiles: \"There will essentially be nothing left of America, which is trying to drag us into escalation. There will be no Biden or Trump. America is being inflicted with 95 percent total damage.\"\nThe war has escalated in many ways recently. Not only is Ukraine firing rockets into Russia, resulting in evacuations within the country, but Russia also recruited 50,000 new troops to their side, including about 10,000 soldiers from North Korea.\nThis increase in troops by Russia is part of an attempt to hold onto territory gained throughout the conflict in the hopes that a Donald Trump-negotiated ceasefire will result in them retaining land gained throughout the war.\nRussian state media has also expressed a hope that a Trump administration will end the shipments of long-range missiles to Ukraine.\nNewsweek reported on Monday that Russian state media cited a source within the Trump transition team who said the decision on ATACMS missiles could be revised. These claims have not been corroborated directly by the Trump team.\nThe president-elect's transition team has been contacted via email for comment outside of normal working hours.\nDo you have a story we should be covering?

    "content": "Since Donald Trump won the election, various U.S. athletes have been adopting the \"Trump Dance\" to celebrate major plays in their relevant sports.\nTrump has been dancing at rallies and other various events for years, which consists of shaking his hips from side to side with his arms in a similar rhythm. In February, Trump's deputy director of communications shared a video of him dancing with cheerleaders and a high school marching band as part of the Super Bowl LVIII celebrations.\nIn October, the Republican decided to stop taking questions from the audience at a Trump town hall event in Oaks, Pennsylvania, and instead played music for 39 minutes. According to The Washington Post, \"some in the crowd began to leave\" after Trump said he wouldn't be taking any more questions at the town hall and instead told his team to play a succession of nine songs as he at times danced on stage.\nNow several sports stars busted out the move to celebrate big plays and here, Newsweek has rounded them up.\nNewsweek also emailed a spokesperson for Trump for comment on Monday.\nSoccer player Christian Pulisic, who is a star of the United States men's national team, is the latest professional athlete to celebrate on the field by performing the Donald Trump dance. On Monday night, he and some of his teammates moved their arms and hips like the president-elect after Pulisic scored the opening goal in the United States' 4-2 victory over Jamaica.\n\"Well obviously that's the Trump dance,\" Pulisic said when asked about the viral moves, per The Athletic. \"It was just a dance that everyone's doing. He's the one who created it. I just thought it was funny.\"\nHe added: \"I saw everyone doing it yesterday in the NFL, I saw Jon Jones do it. We're just having a bit of fun, so I thought it was a pretty fun dance.\"\n\"Christian Pulisic just did the Trump dance after scoring a goal,\" X user (formerly Twitter) @FearedBuck wrote when posting a clip of Pulisic doing the move. The video had 2.8 million views at the time of writing.\nSan Francisco 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa celebrated a sack, which is when a defensive player tackles the quarterback behind the line of scrimmage before they can throw a pass, with teammates in a game at Tampa Bay on November 10.\nAccording to the San Francisco Chronicle, when Bosa was asked what inspired the dance, he said: \"I think you know the answer to that question. All the guys wanted me to do it. I wasn't even going to do it, but the boys reminded me. And it was fun.\"\nA clip of Bosa and his teammates dancing like the president-elect was posted to X, where it went viral.\n\"Bosa and the Niners D just hit the Trump dance after a sack. The NFL can't fine him for that,\" X user @greg_price11 captioned the video. At the time of writing, it had been viewed 1.9 million times.\nThis refers to the fact that the star pass rusher was hit with a fine of $11,255 for a violation of the NFL uniform and equipment rules. This stems from him wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat in support of Trump.\nOn Sunday, Las Vegas Raiders tight end Brock Bowers moved his arms and hips like Trump to celebrate a touchdown for Las Vegas in a 34-19 loss at Miami.\n\"Brock Bowers did the Donald Trump dance after scoring a TD,\" NFL Insider Ari Meirov posted to his X account @MySportsUpdate. At the time of writing, it had been viewed 10.8 million times.\nAfter the game, Bowers told USA Today: \"I've seen everyone do it. I watched the UFC fight [Saturday] night and Jon Jones did it. I like watching UFC so I saw it, and thought it was cool.\"\nJon Jones performed the \"Trump Dance\" to salute his victory over Stipe Miocic at Saturday night's UFC fight in Madison Square Garden in New York City. He then shook hands with the president-elect and handed him his UFC title belt while the crowd chanted, \"USA!\"\n\"Jon Jones just won his UFC fight and did the Trump dance,\" Clay Travis, the founder of OutKick, a sports and political commentary website, posted to X. It had been viewed more than 700,000 times.\nTennessee Titans wide receiver Calvin Ridley did the robotic dance move while celebrating with teammate Nick Westbrook-Ikhine during Tennessee's 23-13 loss to Minnesota.\n\"Calvin Ridley Scores A Touchdown against the Vikings then Hits The Trump Dance,\" Christina Aguayo, a National News Anchor for Salem News Channel, wrote on X.\nOn Sunday, Detroit Lions defensive end Za'Darius Smith and linebacker Malcolm Rodriguez busted the move after a sack in the fourth quarter of Detroit's 52-6 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars.\nAn X user posted a clip of the two athletes dancing with the caption: \"Malcolm Rodriguez and Za'Darius Smith do the Trump celly after the sack.\"\nSmith, who has played for the Ravens, Packers, and Vikings, was recently traded to the Lions.\n",

Rymer listed the Red Sox at No. 2, though they could very easily be considered the top team to land him.\n\"Indeed, the club is in a years-long funk with starting pitching. Breslow was able to get things moving in the right direction early in 2024, but the latter half of the season made it clear how hard it is for an organization to achieve sustainable results through gimmicks alone,\" Rymer wrote. \"Adding talent is therefore a must for Boston, and Fried has plenty of that.\"\nThe need for a starting pitcher is definitely there. The Red Sox will have the money and they'll have the aggressiveness to buy. They can offer a winning team with the potential to go to a World Series if Fried is added.\nBoston has an additional selling point for Fried as well. Fried was high school teammates with both Red Sox starter Lucas Giolito and free agent starter Jack Flaherty. If Boston can come up with the money, it would be quite the selling point to try to bring both Fried and Flaherty to Boston to team back up with Giolito.\nMore MLB: Mets Listed As Top Trade Destination For $3 Million White Sox Ace\n",

    "content": "Ariana Grande's recent weight loss has stirred conversations on social media and among fans as she prepares for the highly anticipated release of Wicked on November 22, 2024.\nGrande's noticeably thinner appearance has drawn both admiration and concern, leading up to the premiere. While some fans have praised her dedication to the role, attributing her physical transformation to embodying Glinda's iconic look, others have expressed worry, suggesting she looks \"unwell\" or \"too thin\" in recent photos.\nGrande herself has addressed public concerns about her appearance, urging followers to avoid commenting on others' bodies, regardless of intent.\nIn a TikTok video from April 2023, she candidly explained that her current physique reflects a healthier phase, contrasting with earlier periods of personal and health struggles when she looked physically different.\nHer transformation has reignited discussions around the resurgence of the \"skinny chic\" aesthetic, a trend noted for extreme thinness, reminiscent of the early 2000s 'heroin chic' aesthetic.\nThis trend rose to prominence in 2022, with a New York Times article highlighting the change and suggesting a cultural shift away from body inclusivity.\nAlthough Kim Kardashian lost weight to wear Marilyn Monroe's iconic dress at the 2022 Met Gala, celebrities like Lizzo and Jameela Jamil have criticized the trend and encouraged fans to prioritize mental health over aesthetics.\nA recent review by the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus reveals a disturbing rise in eating disorders among teens, linked to increased social media use that promotes unattainable beauty ideals.\nThe report points out that social media trends, such as \"thinspo\"—thin inspiration—and \"fitspo\"—fitness inspiration, which glorify extreme thinness and strict dieting, are creating a toxic online culture.\nMental health professionals worry that this shift could heighten body image issues and contribute to eating disorders, especially among young women.\nIn response, Newsweek reached out to media experts and psychologists to gain insights into the potential impact of this trend on mental health and body image.\nI've observed that the \"skinny chic\" trend can trigger or worsen disordered eating behaviors in people who are already vulnerable. Significant changes in eating habits could be a big indicator that somebody is unhealthily trying to lose weight. Other harmful behaviour includes restricting food intake, skipping meals, avoiding social eating, and becoming more fixated on body weight, shape, or size.\nSigns of this might include frequent mirror-checking, drastic changes in exercise patterns, or withdrawal from social situations where food is involved. The person who is struggling might also show sudden mood swings, irritability, or a change in their daily interactions.\nThe cultural conversation around beauty standards must shift towards embracing a more inclusive view of appearance and health.\nAs a body confidence coach who teaches fitness, the warning signs to look out for when somebody is developing an eating disorder are the following: over-exercising and obsessing with calorie-counting apps and gadgets. Many people get excited about new devices and trends, but if they have to follow a specific diet and trend without ever taking a break, or \"a day off\", this may indicate early warning signs.\nYoung people live their lives online now; most teens say they are online almost constantly, connected to algorithmic-driven apps like TikTok. With the skinny trend resurfacing, the issue is that what a person watches and engages with through likes, saves, replays, etc., they get served more of. So, watching videos with hashtags like #skinny or #skinnygirl triggers an endless diet of videos trumpeting how great it is to be skinny and the ways they got there—from \"what I eat in a day\" to exercise routines. In this environment, as young people get served more \"skinny\" content, it begins to normalize the skinny aesthetic, as they get trapped in a funhouse mirror of body dysmorphia.\nFor somebody struggling with their body image, red flags to look for include changes in diet, changes in exercise routine, unhealthy eating patterns—including not wanting to eat at all—and significant weight loss.\nBodies should not be fashion trends, but in the past 50+ years, fashion trends and ideal beauty go hand-in-hand. Each ideal is often elusive for the average woman to attain with extreme measures like dieting and exercise, purging, weight loss supplements, or cosmetic surgery.\nOne of the biggest ways these aesthetics are spread is through social media, which can serve as both poison and panacea. Social media makes the ideal easier to disseminate, for women to socially compare with the ideal, and for women to learn how to achieve the ideal through unhealthy means. However, social media can also be the antidote because it provides a readily available platform for alternative voices and images and social support.\nWith the resurgence of the skinny aesthetic, we ignore the fact that excess body fat has never been embraced in mainstream American culture—not by the media and not by women. As girls, we are taught from early childhood that we are valuable for what we look like, not for any \"masculine\" power we might be able to develop and wield.\nJust look at the popularity of the Barbie movie. For all its attempts to suggest a diverse set of Barbies are all equally valued, the conformist, thin, white, blond, feminine Barbie was literally the star of the show—message received. And now, with semaglutides being advertised as quick fixes for our female bodies, anyone attempting to defy the norm is destined to lose out to larger market and social forces.\nThe female body has been—and is—a project that we are expected to obsess about and ultimately master, right along with our face, which must be constantly scrutinized and altered. Third-wave feminism provided a gloss of dignity to all of this, the idea that we 'choose' to make ourselves into sex objects, but the cold reality is that a sexism which has never gone away actually determines the rules of the game.\n",

    "content": "The U.S. will send antipersonnel land mines to Ukraine in the second major policy shift from the winding-down Joe Biden administration in only a few days, although it remains to be seen just how much of a difference these mines will make in the face of Moscow's advances.\nPresident Biden, who is in a last-ditch effort to supply Ukraine in his final two months in office, greenlit the supply of antipersonnel land mines to Kyiv, a U.S. defense official told Newsweek. The mines will become inactive after a predetermined period of time, the official said. Ukraine has committed not to use the mines in densely populated civilian areas, the official added.\nU.S. officials told The Washington Post, which first reported on the approval, that the Pentagon assesses the mines could be one of the most effective ways to slow Russia's attacks, which have yielded battlefield gains in the east throughout the year.\nLand mines can be effective military tools, but are controversial among human rights groups as they can pose a danger to civilians for a long time. They are banned by over 150 countries, although this does not include Russia or the U.S.\nThe latter has already furnished Ukraine, which is the most mined country in the world, with land mines designed to take out armored vehicles and tanks. Russia has reportedly used more than a dozen types of antipersonnel land mines in Ukraine, according to Human Rights Watch.\nThe HALO Trust, a humanitarian NGO that works to clear land mines, said in a statement shared with Newsweek that the possibility of more antipersonnel land mines in Eastern Europe was a \"clear and present danger,\" adding it \"regrets that the course of the war requires defensive measures of this kind.\"\nThe organization estimated that there has been more than 2 million land mines in Ukraine since February 2022, adding it will continue its work demining in the country after the U.S. government's decision.\nThe Biden administration said in June 2022, shortly after the start of the full-scale war in Ukraine, that it was \"committing to limit the use of antipersonnel land mines.\"\nBiden believed they have \"have disproportionate impact on civilians, including children, long after fighting has stopped,\" the White House said in a statement.\nThe administration pledged not to export or transfer antipersonnel land mines, \"except when necessary for activities related to mine detection or removal, and for the purpose of destruction.\" It also committed to destroying all its antipersonnel land-mine stockpiles, apart from those needed by South Korea.\n\"Ukraine joins U.S. ally South Korea as only one of two countries with authorization to use American antipersonnel mines,\" Ukraine's SPRAVDI center, established by Kyiv's government to counter misinformation, said on Wednesday.\nMoscow has been slowly, but steadily, advancing in eastern Ukraine throughout 2024, focusing its attacks on the country's Donetsk region while launching a cross-border offensive into the northeastern Kharkiv region in May.\nThe Kremlin claimed the former Ukrainian stronghold of Avdiivka in February, and has moved into Chasiv Yar and Toretsk, although it does not fully control these Donetsk settlements. It has been inching toward Pokrovsk, a Ukrainian strategic hub not far from Donetsk's western border with the Dnipropetrovsk region.\nRussia's Defense Ministrysaid on Wednesday that its troops had captured Ilyinka, a village southeast of Pokrovsk.\n\"Russia is attacking Ukrainian lines in the east with waves of troops, regardless of the casualties that they're suffering,\" one official told The Post. \"So the Ukrainians are obviously taking losses, and more towns and cities are at risk of falling. These mines were made specifically to combat exactly this.\"\n\"It's not a game-changing weapon,\" Ivan Stupak, formerly of Ukraine's SBU security service, told Newsweek. Ukraine would also need several thousands of antipersonnel land mines to spread across the hundreds of miles of front line for the explosives to make a difference, Stupak said.\nEarlier this week, U.S. officials said Washington had approved Ukraine using long-range American missiles against Russian soil, which it had long refused to do.\nRussia said on Tuesday that it had recorded the first Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS, launch against its territory.\n\"ATACMS fragments fell on the technical territory of a military facility in the Bryansk region, a fire broke out, it was extinguished,\" the Russian Defense Ministry said.\n\"The multiple use of ATACMS in the Bryansk Region last night signals a desire for escalation,\" Russia's longtime Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said during an appearance at the G20 group of nations' summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Tuesday.\nAs Ukraine marked 1,000 days since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion on Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin rubber-stamped changes to the country's nuclear doctrine. Russia can now justify a nuclear strike against a nation without nuclear weapons, if that country attacks Russia and is backed by a nuclear power, according to the updated Kremlin document.\nWith two months until President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated, there are deep concerns among Ukraine's supporters over what the new year will bring for Kyiv's military supplies. Ukraine is heavily dependent on the U.S. for military aid, which accounts for roughly half of all military assistance heading into the war-torn country.\nTrump has said he will turn off the flow of military aid, and that he can end the war in a day once he returns for his second term in the Oval Office. Officials and experts across Europe anticipate this could mean doing a deal with Putin, which would likely be unsavory to Kyiv.\n",

    "content": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has ordered his country to quickly start mass producing self-detonating explosive drones, calling their development an “essential requirement,” after overseeing a test of the deadly aerial weapon, state media reported Friday.\nImages published by North Korean state media show Kim and various officials at the launch site. Images show a car and a tank being destroyed by what appears to be unmanned aerial vehicles, which have been heavily blurred by the news agency.\nState media reported that drones “of various types precisely hit the targets” as part of the test. They can be “used within different striking ranges” and are designed “to precisely attack any enemy targets on the ground and in the sea,” it said.\nKim said the use of such drones in military activities is being expanded around the world and authorities are recognizing that “drones are achieving clear successes in big and small conflicts,” state media reported.\nSuch self-detonating drones, also sometimes referred to as suicide drones, have been widely used to great effect on the battlefield in Russia’s war in Ukraine and in the Middle East.\nComparatively cheap to produce and usually deployed in swarms making their numbers difficult to shoot down, drones such as the Iranian-made Shahed 136 have transformed modern combat, providing an asymmetric advantage when deployed against technically superior adversaries.\nKim “underscored the need to build a serial production system as early as possible and go into full-scale mass production,” state media reported, adding that “such objective change urgently calls for updating many parts of military theory.”\nThe order comes as concern in the West grows over North Korea’s military cooperation with Russia.\nThe US State Department said Tuesday that 10,000 North Korean soldiers had been sent to Russia and “have begun engaging in combat operations with Russian forces” in Kursk region, where Ukraine’s three-month military incursion into Russian territory has stalled.\nA Ukrainian commander previously told CNN North Korean troops were a “significant resource” for Moscow’s war on Ukraine, as even those being deployed defensively would free up Russian troops for assault operations elsewhere and would eventually be used in direct combat.\nThe North Korean troops dispatched to Russia are deemed to have not had suitable training for drone warfare, according to a South Korea’s Defense Intellectual Agency evaluation shared by lawmakers briefed on the issue.\nSouth Korea’s defense minister last month expressed concern that Pyongyang is “very likely to ask” Moscow for advanced technology related to nuclear weapons in exchange for deploying troops to Ukraine.\nThursday’s drone test came after North Korea on Tuesday ratified a mutual defense treaty with Russia in which the two countries pledged to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance in the event the other is attacked.\nThe move cements the two countries’ deepening alignment in the face of their international isolation over Russia’s war in Ukraine and Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile program.\nThe defense pact was signed in June by Kim and Vladimir Putin during a rare state visit by the Russian leader to Pyongyang.\nKim previously oversaw the test of self-detonating drones in August, where he stressed the need to equip the North Korean army with them “as early as possible.”\nIn October, North Korea threatened “retaliation” after accusing South Korea of flying propaganda-filled drones over Pyongyang. Seoul did not confirm or deny the accusations after North Korea’s state-run KCNA published images of what it claimed was a drone, as well as  leaflets that said, “a comparison of the food you can buy,” and “North Korea’s economic situation falling into hell.”\nIn 2022, North Korea sent five drones into South Korea, four of which flew around Ganghwa island and another that flew over capital Seoul’s northern airspace.\n",

Much like the “white” rhino, it’s a muddy-gray color.\nAs the story goes, English settlers in South Africa mistook the Afrikaans word “wyd” (meaning “wide” in English), used to describe the mouth shape of the larger of the two rhinos, for the English word “white.” So, naturally, black was then used to refer its smaller, pointier-lipped relative. Or, others suggest the name reflects the dark color it turns after a muddy wallow.\nConsistent hunting and land clearance throughout the early and mid 20th century reduced the black rhino population to an estimated 100,000 by 1960. In the following decades, large-scale poaching intensified, causing a 98% collapse in population size, with total numbers reaching an all-time low of 2,354 in the mid 1990s.\nThis prompted drastic and concerted conservation efforts across several African countries to help save the critically endangered species. A ban on black rhino trade, the expansion and stricter protection of their home ranges, and relocation programs involving unusual methods, have resulted in a remarkable recovery. According to the IUCN, 6,421 black rhinos were recorded across the continent in 2024.\n\n",

    "content": "Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has sued a court-appointed bankruptcy trustee and the families of some of the Sandy Hook victims in an attempt to stop the sale of his media empire Infowars to the satirical news outlet The Onion.\nIn a lawsuit filed Monday in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Jones claimed trustee Christopher Murray and the families “colluded”  for a “flagrantly non-compliant Frankenstein bid” and asked a judge to halt the sale.\nThe parent company of Infowars was auctioned off last week as part of bankruptcy proceedings to help pay some of the nearly $1.5 billion Jones owes the families of the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre for defamation.\nAccording to court documents, The Onion, via its parent company Global Tetrahedron, offered $1.75 million in cash along with a “credit” from the Connecticut families, who offered to forgo 100% of their portion of the winning bid to support the effort.\nThe one other competing bid, at $3.5 million, came from First United American Companies, which is affiliated with Jones and operates his lucrative online nutritional supplements store.\nJohn Feinblatt and Ben Collins join The Lead\nRelated video\nOnion CEO: We’ll ‘pave over’ Alex Jones’ Infowars universe\nBut The Onion, according to a copy of its bid filed as evidence by Jones, said their bid should be valued at closer to $7 million considering the families’ credit. Jones’ attorneys argued that The Onion’s math to reach such a figure is “nonsense.”\nJones’ suit also claimed his defamation verdict will be overturned on appeal.\nA spokesperson for The Onion declined to comment. A spokesperson for the families did not respond to a request for comment.\nJones’ lawsuit comes after First United American Companies also filed an emergency motion to stop the sale. In response to those complaints, Murray, who had discretion to choose the winning bidder, wrote that First United American Companies was a “disappointed bidder.”\n“The Trustee intends to respond in due course fully and in detail to the barrage of baseless allegations, selective quoting and half-truths in FUAC’s recent filings,” Murray wrote to the court Monday.\nOne of the issues, attorneys for First United American Companies said in court last week, was that the trustee changed the format of the auction to a best and final written offer instead of holding a live auction. First United American Companies said that it was not made aware of the winning bid amount and did not have the opportunity to increase its offer.\nFederal bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez, who is overseeing the case, harshly questioned an attorney for the trustee about the auction rules.\n“I am not comfortable with the process and the highest level of transparency that took place,” Lopez said during a hearing Thursday, adding the court will hold an evidentiary hearing to fully understand what took place.\nMurray, the trustee, said during the hearing that the auction process involved a round “where people could submit sealed bids” for the specific Infowars assets they were interested in. Then, “under the auction procedures, when those come in, we evaluate that and then decide how to proceed to if we do it all the next auction, the order is very clear that there doesn’t even have to be another auction.”\nAn attorney for The Onion’s parent Global Tetrahedron said they were only privy to as much information about the auction process as the other bidders and were somewhat surprised that there was not a live auction.\nWhile Lopez said that he expected to hold an evidentiary hearing on the auction process sometime early this week, a hearing has yet to be scheduled. The next hearing on the docket is scheduled for November 25.\n",

    "content": "A beagle who had spent the vast majority of his life living in a cage at an animal testing facility has taken his first steps as a free dog.\nFor the longest time, all Zoomer, aged 6, ever knew was pain. However, that all changed when he was rescued by the Beagle Freedom Project (BFP), an organization dedicated to the rescue and rehoming of animals used in experimental research.\n\"Zoomer came to us from a laboratory overseas in South Korea,\" Kaitlyn Morris, a social media and animal care associate at the BFP, told Newsweek. \"We have rescue partners in South Korea and they help us get dogs out of labs there and find volunteers to fly them to us. We are grateful to the kind people who flew to the U.S. with Zoomer.\"\nThe BFP didn't know the specifics of what Zoomer went through previously but it was clear his life to date had been a difficult one.\n\"All we know about Zoomer's past is that he was bred to be used in animal testing, was testing on since puppyhood, and was kept in a cage without any enrichment or love,\" Morris said. \"Unfortunately we don't know the exact types of testing Zoomer experienced, but they were almost certainly inhumane, dangerous, and painful.\"\nAccording to figures published by the charity Cruelty Free International, as of 2015, an estimated 207,724 laboratory tests were conducted using dogs.\nWhile that number has likely changed in the years since, animal testing remains a major concern, particularly in South Korea where, according to Humane Society International, last year statistics showed animal use in South Korean laboratories had reached a record high of nearly 5 million in 2022.\nMorris said that beagles are often used in testing because of their \"docile and forgiving nature.\"\n\"They are unlikely to fight back when hurt. They can be abused and still have their tails wagging the next day,\" she said. \"Their small size also makes them easy to 'maintain' in tiny cages. It's heartbreaking and deeply disturbing.\"\nThankfully, that chapter of Zoomer's life is now over. In a video posted to the BFP TikTok page, the understandably cautious canine can be seen taking his first steps out of the carrier that brought him over from South Korea and on to U.S. soil.\nWhile it was an undoubtedly joyous moment for all involved, BFP staff knew it would take Zoomer some time to adjust. Though beagles may be tested upon because of their docile demeanor, dogs like Zoomer are living proof that the scars left by their harrowing ordeals run deep.\n\"Zoomer, along with his friends who came from the same lab, definitely suffers from PTSD,\" Morris said. \"He was a brave boy taking his first steps of freedom, but once he got to his foster home he was nervous and required a lot of patience as most laboratory testing survivors do.\"\nThankfully, it didn't take long for Zoomer to realize he was safe and that part of his life was over. \"He adjusted very quickly and wanted love and affection from the get go,\" Morris said. \"Most of our laboratory testing survivors find happiness and learn to be dogs—but there are always specific triggers that can cause panic and take them back to the lab.\"\nHaving endured the worst any dog can face, Zoomer is now living his very best life having recently been adopted. He's settled into his new life already with his new human companions eager to make up for the cuddles and love he missed out on for so many years.\n\"Zoomer loves to receive affection, sleep in his cozy bed, and cuddle with other dogs,\" Morris said. With another dog in the house to keep him company and entertained, it sounds like Zoomer has finally got the happy ending every good dog deserves.\n",

    "content": "Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of defense, was involved in a police investigation into an alleged sexual assault in 2017, local officials in California confirmed Thursday night.\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the city government of Monterey, California, said its police department had investigated “an alleged sexual assault” involving Hegseth, a Fox News host and Army National Guard veteran. The alleged assault took place in the early morning hours of October 8, 2017, at the address of the Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel and Spa, and was reported four days later, according to the statement.\nHegseth was a speaker at a conference held by the California Federation of Republican Women at the hotel during the timeframe when the alleged assault took place, according to photos of the event posted on Facebook.\nThe city’s statement did not specifically identify Hegseth as an alleged assailant, but said he was involved in the investigation and that the victim’s name and age were confidential. The statement said that there were no weapons involved, but there were injuries – “contusions to right thigh” – without providing additional details. The city said that it would not release the full police report or comment further on the investigation, citing state public records law.\nWhen asked for response to Monterey’s statement, Timothy Parlatore, a lawyer representing Hegseth, told CNN on Friday, “This statement confirms that although an allegation was made, it was fully investigated and no charges were filed.”\nDescribing Trump’s early selections for his administration as “high-caliber and extremely qualified,” Trump’s communications director defended Hegseth in a statement to CNN.\n“Mr. Hegseth has vigorously denied any and all accusations, and no charges were filed,” said Trump communications director Steven Cheung. “We look forward to his confirmation as United States Secretary of Defense so he can get started on Day One to Make America Safe and Great Again.”\nMembers of Trump’s transition team, including incoming Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, discussed the allegation with Hegseth on Thursday, and he claimed the investigation was related to a consensual sexual encounter, Vanity Fair reported Thursday night, citing two unnamed sources.\nThe city’s statement does not indicate what became of the investigation. Hegseth has not been charged in any criminal case or named as a defendant in any civil lawsuit filed in Monterey County since 2017, a spokesperson for the county court told CNN on Thursday.\nTrump named Hegseth as his choice for secretary of defense on Tuesday, surprising both Pentagon officials and the former president’s own allies by picking a nominee without senior military or public office experience. Hegseth serves as a co-host of the “Fox & Friends Weekend” show, previously led several nonprofits and briefly ran to represent Minnesota in the US Senate in 2012.\nHegseth has blasted military leadership for promoting diversity, and railed against women serving in combat. In an interview earlier this year, he said that “women shouldn’t be in combat at all. They’re life-givers, not life-takers.”\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\nCNN’s Sara Murray contributed to this report.\n",

Trump named his other transition co-chair, Howard Lutnick, as his pick to lead the Commerce Department earlier Tuesday after the Cantor Fitzgerald CEO had thrown his name into the mix for Treasury secretary, sparking a battle with hedge fund manager Scott Bessent.\nRelated article\nTracking Trump’s picks for his Cabinet and administration\n“Linda will use her decades of Leadership experience, and deep understanding of both Education and Business, to empower the next Generation of American Students and Workers, and make America Number One in Education in the World. We will send Education BACK TO THE STATES, and Linda will spearhead that effort,” Trump said in a statement.\nMcMahon, a major Republican donor and a former pro-wrestling executive, served as the administrator of the Small Business Administration during Trump’s first term. She was appointed in 2017 and resigned in 2019 to become the chair of America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC.\nShe is the board chair of the America First Policy Institute, a pro-Trump think tank that was formed in 2021 by McMahon, Larry Kudlow and other advisers from the first Trump administration.\nAFPI has raised millions of dollars since it was founded and has been described as a “White-House-in-waiting,” planning potential policy proposals for Trump’s second term.\nTrump’s education secretary could potentially be tasked with overseeing the department’s demise after the president-elect repeatedly called for abolishing the agency on the campaign trail.\nIt would be difficult to get rid of the entire department, which delivers federal funding to nearly every public K-12 school in the country and manages the $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio. And shutting it down would require an act of Congress.\nRelated article\nWhat the next Trump presidency could mean for US education\nIt may be more likely that some programs are moved to other federal agencies. The overarching goal for many Republicans is to reduce the federal government’s role in local education, which could be achieved by retaining funding programs but delivering money to states and schools with fewer strings attached.\nUnder the new education secretary, the department may use the formal regulatory process to undo changes the Biden administration made to Title IX that sought to expand protections for LGBTQ+ students. A new rule could potentially say that Title IX prevents trans students from playing on girls’ sports teams, something Trump campaigned on.\nMcMahon is also the former CEO of the WWE, which she co-founded with her husband, Vince McMahon. As head of the WWE, Linda McMahon oversaw its transformation from a small wrestling entertainment company into a publicly traded media empire. She stepped down as CEO in 2009.\nMcMahon twice ran unsuccessfully for the US Senate in Connecticut, losing in 2010 and 2012. She self-funded those campaigns, spending $50.1 million in 2010 and $48.7 million in 2012, according to Open Secrets, a nonprofit organization that tracks campaign financing. Trump donated $5,000 to her campaign in 2012.\nMcMahon herself is a major Republican donor.

    "content": "A Chinese vessel has been implicated in what has been described as the sabotage of undersea telecom cables in the Baltic Sea, a body of water dubbed the \"NATO Lake\" due to its location between alliance members.\nInternational concern surrounds the cutting of the 730-mile C-Lion 1 cable connecting Finland and Germany and the 130-mile link between Sweden and Lithuania on Monday. A legal expert has told Newsweek that any investigation into the incidents \"could span years\" and could set precedents for future alleged incidents of underwater sabotage.\nGerman Defense Minister Boris Pistorius described the incidents as \"hybrid\" actions, while his Swedish and Lithuanian counterparts said they were \"deeply concerned.\"\nNone named any country, but the incidents come at a time of tension with Moscow, which has been accused of stoking tensions in the region with hybrid attacks, as the war it started in Ukraine continues to rage.\nThe U.K. newspaper Financial Times reported that investigators of the severed cables are looking into the movements of the Chinese bulk carrier Yi Peng 3, which was en route to Egypt's Port Said from the Russian port of Ust-Luga. Social media reports said that the vessel had a Russian captain, although this has not been independently confirmed.\nThe Yi Peng 3 had passed close to both cables around the time each was cut on Sunday and Monday, according to maritime tracking group Marine Traffic. The vessel was then followed by the Danish Navy, according to open-source intelligence analysts.\n\"Ship suspected of damaging comms cables x 2 in Baltic Sea has been detained by Danish Navy,\" posted OSINT account auonsson on Blue Sky, which tracks vessels in the Baltic. The post said that it was \"anchored just outside Danish territory with patrol/dive Y311 SØLØVEN vessel guarding her.\"\n\"Frigate HDMS HVIDBJØRNEN might be present too (no AIS but made speed toward situation.)\" the post added. Newsweek has contacted the Danish Navy and the Chinese Foreign Ministry for comment.\nBen Knowles, a partner and global arbitration group chair at law firm Clyde & Co, told Newsweek that the incidents \"raised significant legal implications.\"\n\"Like the Nord Stream incidents, there is likely to be a complex and lengthy investigation to determine the cause and identify those responsible,\" Knowles said, referring to the September 2022 gas pipelines between Russia and Germany destroyed by explosions whose cause has not yet been officially established.\n\"The investigation could span years, given all the technical, geopolitical, and jurisdictional factors involved,\" Knowles added. Once the cause and culpability are established, the focus will shift to allocating financial responsibility and addressing claims for damages.\n\"These could include insurance claims, compensation for service disruptions, and potential diplomatic or legal actions between nations,\" Knowles said. \"The outcomes could set precedents for the handling of undersea infrastructure sabotage in an increasingly tense global environment,\" added the expert.\nFinland and Sweden have opened investigations, but Helsinki has urged caution in not jumping to conclusions. The Finnish said China cooperated with a probe into an incident last year in which another Chinese damaged a Baltic gas pipeline between Finland and Estonia, with neither country yet claiming it was intentional.\nTensions around alleged Russian actions in the Baltic Sea is acute given Moscow's ongoing invasion of Ukraine and the Kremlin's belligerent rhetoric toward NATO.\nMedia outlets in Norway have reported concerns at the presence of the Russian intelligence ship Yantar alongside its coast near critical seabed infrastructure such as oil and gas pipelines and cables for internet and telecommunications.\nNikolai Patrushev, a close aide to Vladimir Putin, this month blamed the U.S. and the U.K. for the Nord Stream explosions and were planning others. In reporting Patrushev's comments to Kommersant, Telegram channel Crimean Wind said \"such statements often sound like a cover for their own intentions.\"\n",

    "content": "Building new railways is an expensive business. Even in ideal circumstances, carving a new route through the landscape costs millions of dollars per mile and can take decades to complete.\nIf you want to build that railway through one of Europe’s most densely populated countries, expect the costs and opposition to increase dramatically.\nWith its first — and now only — phase currently costed at between $58.4 billion and $70 billion by the UK government, Britain’s High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project now costs an eye watering $416 million per mile.\nIt’s a metric that gives it the dubious honor of being the world‘s most expensive railway project.\nOnly the equally troubled $128-billion California High Speed Rail project in the United States comes close to matching HS2’s soaring costs, with some estimates suggesting that it could top out at $200 million per mile.\nFor comparison, the Tours-Bordeaux TGV line in France cost around $32-$40 million per mile in the mid-2010s — although much of that line runs through sparsely populated agricultural regions.\nRelated article\nBritain invented trains. Now its railway system seems to be having a nervous breakdown\nEuropean high speed rail projects outside the UK typically cost around $66.4 million per mile.\nPopulation density and topography obviously have a significant effect on construction costs. That said, China and Japan have succeeded in threading new high-speed railways through some of the world‘s most densely populated megacities for far less than it will cost Britain to build the 140 miles of track between London and the central English city of Birmingham.\nAnd Chinese contractors managed to drive the Jakarta-Bandung “WHOOSH” high-speed line through some of Indonesia’s most difficult and densely populated terrain for around $80 million per mile.\nBut in Britain, where it’s common for major infrastructure projects to blow their budget, the costs for HS2 keep racking up.\nNow, with even its supporters despairing at how it’s been managed in recent years, the rail project is widely viewed as an expensive mess that will likely never deliver many of the social and economic benefits it once promised.\nSo, how did it get here?\nPolitical interference. Chronic short-termism. The UK’s lack of long-term, integrated transport and industrial policies. Slow and overly bureaucratic planning and environmental regimes. Poor project management. Inadequate oversight by the civil servants and government.\nThe blame list goes on.\nAdd to that a construction industry seeking to insulate itself from all of the above with contract bids that include enormous mitigation costs.\nSince it was launched in 2012 with a projected overall cost of $42.8 billion for almost 400 miles of new railway, HS2 has been led by five different CEOs and seven chairmen. It has, in theory, been overseen by six prime ministers, eight finance ministers and nine transport ministers during a time of unprecedented political turmoil in the UK.\nRelated article\nFlying without wings: The world’s fastest trains\nIn October 2024, the London Times newspaper called HS2 “a story of prolonged dysfunction.”\nIt said: “The gradual stunting of HS2 represents egregious short-termism but also an object lesson in why Britain struggles to escape its doom loop of anemic growth.\n“The project has become emblematic of Britain’s inability to complete big infrastructure projects.”\nRailway journalist, author and long-time HS2 skeptic Christian Wolmar told CNN Travel the project was likely doomed from the start, with a soaring price tag partly down to simple design flaws.\n“A number of mistakes were made at the outset, including the decision to build the line for 400 kilometers per hour (250 mph) operation — 100 kph faster than the international norm,” he says.\n“There was also a lack of discussion over the chosen route, which could have followed existing highway corridors.”\nRapidly rising construction costs have plagued major projects across the world in recent years. But even before the Covid pandemic, Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine and the surge in inflation that followed those global events, HS2‘s spiraling costs were starting to alarm many observers.\nSpeaking at an industry conference in 2022, Ricardo Ferreras, director of Spanish construction giant Ferrovial — one of many companies involved in HS2 — blamed the process of obtaining permits and conducting environmental studies for the increased cost of building high-speed railways in the UK.\n“It’s true the cost per kilometer is way higher in the UK than it is in Europe, for example in France or Spain,” Ferreras said, laying most of the blame at the maze of UK planning and environmental restrictions construction companies must navigate.\n“As an example, in Spain the government will get all consents, and all environmental permits, and then when they award the contract, the contractor can just focus on delivering the project.”\nThere’s no doubt that building railways is cheaper elsewhere. As journalist Wolmar points out, Spain has built an entire high-speed rail network of 2,500 miles for around $65 billion, which in the UK won’t even cover the cost of HS2’s 140 miles from Birmingham to the London suburbs.\nBut, he says, the costs associated with HS2 still boggle the mind.\n“There are mitigating factors such as the relative cost of land and the lack of opposition in other countries but, regardless, a variance of 10 or 20 times is remarkable,” he says.\nHS2 initially seemed to make sense to many. Successive UK governments have sold the project to voters as a chance to “level up” deprived post-industrial cities across central and northern regions through investment in improved infrastructure to create “northern powerhouses.”\nBut not everyone was convinced even before costs got really out of hand. UK social justice think tank New Economics Foundation, in analysis published in 2019, said HS2 was more likely to benefit London rather than the northern cities.\n“The High Speed 2 (HS2) rail line will deepen the regional divide and should be shelved in favor of investments across the rail network, especially in the north of England,” it said.\nHS2 has always been controversial for a whole host of reasons.\nRight from the start it generated anger from communities blighted by its construction as well as environmentalists trying to save ancient woodland lying in its path.\nAlso upset were those who argued that even its original price tag was steep for a rail line that would offer only marginally faster travel, regardless of whether it would free up capacity on the existing rail network for regional and freight trains.\nThe need to soothe angry residents in communities along the route added to the massive cost.\nOpposition was especially fierce where HS2 slices through quintessential English rolling landscapes north of London, dotted with ancient woodlands and historic villages.\nRelated article\nEurope was on the brink of a night train revolution. Here’s what actually happened\nWealthy retirees living in the pretty Chiltern Hills found themselves in a surprising coalition with radical environmental campaigners from the likes of Extinction Rebellion as they attempted to halt the project. However, their efforts were in vain and only succeeded in significantly driving up construction costs.\nMany miles of extra tunnels and expensive earthworks were added to make the railway “disappear” from view, adding billions to the price tag but doing almost nothing to reduce opposition from a vociferous anti-HS2 lobby.\nThis month it was announced that nearly $130 million would be spent on a one-kilometer-long “bat shed” covering the track in rural Buckinghamshire to ensure high-speed trains do not disturb bats living in nearby woodland. Its construction was demanded by planning authorities despite a lack of any evidence that bats are affected by passing trains, according to HS2’s builder.\nWhere other countries build their new railways largely at ground level or elevated on seemingly endless concrete viaducts, Britain has chosen a far more expensive route that requires 32 miles of tunnels and 130 bridges — including the UK’s longest viaduct. On average, it costs 10 times per mile of track more to build in a tunnel than above ground.\nIndeed, putting the arguments aside for a moment, HS2 will feature some stunning civil engineering achievements.\nThe Colne Valley Viaduct taking the railway out of northwest London stretches for more than two miles over a series of lakes and waterways. Major new stations at London Euston — if it is completed — Old Oak Common, Birmingham Airport and Curzon Street in Birmingham city center have been planned as modern-day “cathedrals” of transport inspired by Britain’s magnificent Victorian era terminals.\nA “gold-plated” specification means that the tracks will be suitable for the fastest regular trains in the world when they eventually start running in the 2030s. Concrete “slab” tracks will require much less maintenance than traditional lines. Equipment such as tunnel ventilation shafts will be cleverly disguised to blend in with surroundings.\nWork is underway at 350 sites. This includes four enormous, 2,000-tonne machines deployed to bore new tunnels – 14 miles of which have already been completed in the three years since construction started in earnest.\nAbove ground, HS2 Limited, the umbrella company tasked with building the railway, and its contractors have gone to enormous lengths to mitigate their impact on the environment along the route, tweaking the route to limit damage to woodlands and designated areas of outstanding natural beauty, planting millions of new trees and funding millions of dollars worth of environmental and community projects from rewilding schemes to school playgrounds.\nBut while the price tag kept escalating, public willingness to foot the bill has diminished. And when the cost of building Phases 1 and 2 rocketed to an estimated $130 billion, the UK government came under increasing pressure to find savings.\nHS2 was originally conceived as a Y-shaped network that, once at Birmingham, would split west and east toward the cities of Manchester and Leeds, connecting the capital with the key city regions across north and central England.\nThen, in November 2021, the eastern arm was amputated, followed in 2022 by the Crewe-Manchester section in northwest England and finally a crucial line creating extra capacity between Birmingham and Crewe, a famous railway junction for lines to northwest England, Scotland and Wales.\nAt the same time, the then Conservative government also caused further dismay by suggesting that the line would not run into central London as planned, instead fizzling out at a new $1.3 billion transit interchange at Old Oak Common on the western fringes of the city.\nWhile the new Labour government elected in July 2024 has made positive noises about investing in infrastructure to stimulate economic growth and possibly completing the tunnels under London to reach the planned terminus at Euston, it has so far dismissed calls for the Birmingham-Crewe section of Phase 2 to be reinstated.\nRelated article\nSpain’s new high-speed trains make it Europe’s rail capital\nThe final design of the London terminal at Euston is still to be confirmed and there are still huge doubts about its cost and scope of the expanded terminal, how many platforms it will have and who will pay for it. The original plan for up to 14 high-speed trains per hour has been scaled back to just eight per hour, with many shuttling only between London and Birmingham.\nMeanwhile passengers at the existing station at Euston are forced to pick their way through an enormous building site to find their trains — a situation that could continue for another decade.\nEven the hugely controversial decision to scrap all HS2 lines north of Birmingham, made by former prime minister Rishi Sunak in October 2023, added more than $2.6 billion to the bill in write-offs and accounting costs for work already undertaken. That move was touted by Sunak as saving $47 billion to be redirected to other transport projects across the country, although in reality little of that funding was ever forthcoming.\nThere are fears that the overall price tag could, in fact, keep climbing.\n“With no clear budget and with the now extended timeline for Phase 1, which still has no clear opening date, it is impossible to obtain any accurate assessment of final costs,” rail journalist Wolmar adds.\n“With rail passenger levels only just returning to pre-Covid levels and the nation’s coffers almost empty, the country is left with a ludicrously expensive venture that, in its current mutilated form, is essentially pointless.”\nHS2 supporters maintain that the biggest benefits of the original “Y” shaped route would have been generated away from London, in the long-neglected post-industrial regions of the Midlands and northern England.\nThese areas suffer from poor transport links, leading to low productivity and pockets of deprivation that are among the worst in Europe. By creating fast new rail links between cities such as Nottingham, Sheffield, Leeds and Manchester and freeing up capacity on existing railways for better local services and more freight, promoters hoped that HS2 would be the spark to ignite much-needed growth outside London.\nRelated article\nEurope’s most underrated scenic railways\nRail industry leaders claim that reinstating the Birmingham-Crewe section of HS2 could actually save the government money, by increasing the value of future operating concessions. These could be worth around $26 billion if fully developed from central London and joining lines to northern cities.\nHowever, the section under construction between west London and Birmingham would be worth just a quarter of that according to an analysis by the High Speed Rail Group (HSRG).\nHSRG, a coalition of rail and engineering companies whose members include global transport giants Hitachi, Alstom, Siemens and UK train operators, argues that spending billions more now to reach Euston and Crewe would save the UK Treasury $4.5 billion in the long run.\nIn the meantime, London continues to dominate the UK economy, sucking investment and talent out of the regions and widening the already cavernous gap between the capital and the rest of the country.\nUnlike the London-Birmingham route, where HS2 trains will whizz from city to city on all-new lines at up to 250 mph from the mid-2030s, services continuing to Manchester, Liverpool and Scotland will have to run at just half that speed — and often much slower — to reach their destinations.\nAnd those high-speed trains to the other cities will have to compete for track space with existing inter-city trains, regional services and slow-moving freight on lines that are already struggling to cope with congestion.\nRail experts and even the independent National Audit Office public spending watchdog warn that far from increasing capacity for passengers and freight to meet climate change targets, the current plan will lead to reduced rail capacity and higher fares.\nThat, in turn, will force travelers back onto congested road networks — or aboard short-haul air routes, from where at least they’ll get a great view of the gleaming new high-speed railway line and, perhaps, an opportunity to try to figure out where all the money was spent.\n",

    "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\nA mummified ice age cub from Siberia is the first known mummy of a saber-toothed cat, and its discovery is generating ripples of excitement among paleontologists. The mummy’s exceptional preservation provided the first view of what saber-toothed cats looked like. Written in its soft tissues are clues about where the cat’s muscles were bulkiest and how that may have shaped its hunting style.\nAbundant fur and mummified flesh covered the partial corpse, and its face, forelimbs and torso were nearly intact, scientists reported Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports. The cub’s dark brown fur was short but very thick, measuring about 0.8 to 1.2 inches (20 to 30 millimeters) long. Its fur was also surprisingly soft, said lead study author Alexey V. Lopatin, full member of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow and chief researcher and director of the academy’s Borissiak Paleontological Institute.\nRelated article\nWoolly rhino found preserved in Russian permafrost after 32,000 years\n“It’s a fantastic feeling to see with your own eyes the life appearance of a long-extinct animal,” Lopatin told CNN in an email. “Especially when it comes to such an interesting predator as the sabre-toothed cat.” These extinct carnivores, which are distant relatives of modern big cats, are known for their long, bladelike canines, which could measure up to 8 inches (20 centimeters) long.\nThe mummy is the first evidence from Asia of the saber-toothed cat species Homotherium latidens, Lopatin said, though fossilized bones were previously found at sites in the Netherlands and in the Canadian Yukon. Other types of frozen ice age mummies, such as woolly rhinos and mammoths, are known from the Siberian region of Yakutia in Russia.\nBut mummified cats, by comparison, “are extremely rare,” Lopatin said. Before this discovery, there were just two known cat mummies, both cubs of the cave lion Panthera spelaea from Yakutia’s Uyandina River basin.\n“Now, we have added the Homotherium cub to this list,” Lopatin said. Extracting DNA from the mummy will be an important next step for understanding this species, as will more detailed examination of the mummy’s skeleton, muscles and hair, he added.\nPaleontologist Jack Tseng, who studies the anatomy of extinct mammals and was not involved in the discovery, was “at a loss for words” when he considered “the treasure trove of information that could come out of this singular discovery,” he told CNN.\n“It’s rare to find bones of this lineage in the first place, let alone soft tissue associated with it,” said Tseng, an associate professor in the integrative biology department at the University of California, Berkeley. “I don’t know if other paleontologists’ minds are as blown as mine, but it’s like reality changes now that we’ve seen this.”\nThe cub was preserved in permafrost near the Badyarikha River in the northeast of Yakutia, and Yakutian diggers found the mummy in 2020 while prospecting for mammoth tusks under the supervision of Yakutian paleontologists, Lopatin told CNN in an email. Radiocarbon dating revealed that the cub was at least 35,000 years old and lived during the latter part of the Pleistocene epoch (about 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago).\nPreservation of the cub’s forelimbs in particular was extraordinary, the study authors wrote. Its front paws even retained claws and the oval, fleshy pads on the underside of the paw that are fondly referred to as “beans” by admirers of modern cats.\nAlong with the partial mummy, articulated bones of the cub’s pelvis and hind limbs were also found locked in ice. Based on comparisons with lion cub anatomy and analysis of the mummified cub’s incisor growth, scientists estimated that the cub was about 3 weeks old when it died.\nHowever, the mummy also showed that saber-toothed cubs differed dramatically from modern lion cubs of a similar age, Lopatin said. Its coat was darker, and its ears were smaller than those of lion cubs; it had longer forelimbs, a larger mouth opening and a more massive neck. The height of the mummy’s upper lip is more than twice that of a modern lion cub’s, probably so its lip could cover the long upper canines once they grew in, according to Lopatin.\nRelated article\nScans help solve a 3,000-year-old mystery of a high-status Egyptian woman\nIts paw is also more circular than that of a lion cub; in fact, its shape more closely resembles the paw of a bear, Tseng added. Bears are known for using their powerful forearms to dig through trees and undergrowth for food; the size and shape of the mummified cub’s paws and front limbs suggest that an adult Homotherium may have also relied on its forearms, perhaps using them to immobilize its kills, he said.\n“The idea about saber-toothed cats is that they had to have some sort of assistance from the rest of the body — that it’s not just a headfirst hunting technique,” Tseng said. “And the forearm has been one of the targets of research to think about. Are they buffer in their forearms compared to modern big cats of similar sizes, because they need a forearm to help stabilize their prey so that the saber can be put to use?”\nUntil now, scientists have hypothesized about saber-toothed cat anatomy by scanning fossils and digitally modeling the animals’ muscles in 3D, but that doesn’t compare to seeing one of those limbs “in the flesh,” Tseng said. “I think it makes it seem more possible that these saber-tooths would have used their forearms.”\nAnd it’s not just the anatomy of the Homotherium mummy that makes it so special — the discovery also provides a unique glimpse into the evolutionary history of the entire feline group, Tseng said. Prior genetic analysis of DNA from Homotherium fossils showed that the genus split from other ancient cats about 18 million years ago. Not only is the cub the sole mummified example of the Homotherium genus, “it represents a part of that cat family tree that goes back almost to the origin of the cat family,” he said.\n“That adds to the mind-blowingness of this discovery.”\nMindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine.\n",

    "content": "For Laken Riley’s mother, the anguish of losing a child in a gruesome attack is amplified by the horror of hearing details about the final minutes of her daughter’s life.\nBut a relentless pursuit of justice has brought Allyson Phillips to the front row of a Georgia courtroom’s cold, barren benches each day of suspect Jose Ibarra’s murder trial.\nRelated card\nProsecutors: Heart rate and speed charts show Laken Riley’s final moments\nThe prosecution rested Tuesday, and the defense will resume calling witnesses Wednesday. The case could go to the judge for a decision later in the day.\nPhillips, her husband John, and Riley’s father, Jason Riley, have sat through hours of agonizing testimony and evidence.\nThe suspect, an undocumented migrant from Venezuela, has shown little emotion throughout the trial. A few yards away, Riley’s mother has openly wept numerous times – including when an officer testified about missed calls between Riley and her mother the morning Riley died.\nThese are some of the most intense revelations from the trial so far:\nRiley, a former cross-country runner, was last seen alive jogging near the University of Georgia’s Oconee Forest Park the morning of February 22.\nShe was a student at UGA until spring 2023, before switching to Augusta University’s College of Nursing in the same city of Athens.\nUGA surveillance video shows Riley jogging with her phone in her left hand – a device that would play a key role in the trial.\nPhillips sobbed as she watched footage of her daughter the day she died.\nHours after Riley left for her run, the surveiilance footage shows two of her roommates and their dog searching for their missing friend near a trailhead. They leave about 20 minutes later, with Riley nowhere to be found.\nForensic evidence shows Riley “fought for her life” and “fought for her dignity,” before she died, the prosecution said.\nGenetic testing of fingernail clippings from Riley revealed a link to the genetic profile of Ibarra, Georgia Bureau of Investigation crime lab scientist Ashley Hinkle testified Tuesday.\nFor someone to get another person’s DNA under their fingernails, it generally “either has to have some sort of scratching or contact with the inside of the nail,” Hinkle said.\nRelated article\nOfficer describes injuries that \"looked like fingernail scratches\" on Jose Ibarra\nIn separate testimony Monday, UGA police Sgt. Joshua Epps said he encountered Ibarra the day after Riley’s killing and noticed what “looked like fingernail scratches.”\n“While speaking to him, I noticed on his right arm, his bicep, there was a scratch,” Epps said. “On his left arm, he had a forearm scratch that was very similar – which in my mind, looked like fingernail scratches to me.”\n“I also noticed on his left wrist, just below the palm, he had a puncture – maybe half an inch wide – that, through my experiences playing sports in high school, and receiving the same injury from fingernails in football, I could see, like, wet flesh, like almost like it was fresh,” Epps said. “It wasn’t very old.”\nAs Epps described the injuries he saw on Ibarra’s arms, Riley’s mother cried and wiped away tears.\nPerhaps the most poignant testimony came Tuesday when UGA police Sgt. Sophie Raboud recounted Riley’s last communications on her cell phone.\nMinutes before her death, Riley called and texted her mother to see if she wanted to catch up. The missed call would be the last time Riley reached out to a loved one.\nPhillips sobbed in court as she listened to the police sergeant, who also sounded emotional when describing the following timeline:\n8:55 a.m.: Riley sent her final text to her mother: “Good morning,” she wrote. “About to go for a run if you’re free to talk.”\n9:03 a.m.: Riley called her mother, but she did not answer.\n9:11 a.m.: Riley called 911.\n9:12 a.m.: The 911 operator called Riley back twice within one minute.\n9:24 a.m.: Riley’s mother called her daughter back, but Riley didn’t answer.\n9:37 a.m.: Riley’s mother texted her daughter: “Call me when you can.”\n9:51 a.m.: Riley’s mother called her daughter again.\nRelated video\n‘He went hunting for females,’ prosecutor claims during trial\n9:53 a.m.: Riley’s mother called her daughter again.\n9:58 a.m.: Riley’s mother texted her daughter: “You’re making me nervous not answering while you’re out running. Are you OK?”\n11:04 a.m.: Riley’s mother called her daughter again.\n11:12 a.m.: Riley’s mother called her daughter again.\n11:15 a.m.: Riley’s mother called her daughter again.\n11:19 a.m.: Riley’s sister tried to call.\n11:47 a.m.: Riley’s mother texted her daughter: “Please call me, I’m worried sick about you.”\n12:07 p.m.: Riley’s mother called her daughter again.\n12:20 p.m.: Riley’s stepfather tried to call.\nAt 12:38 p.m., police found Riley’s body in a wooded area near Lake Herrick.\nRiley’s father, mother and stepfather left the courtroom before a medical examiner testified about their daughter’s injuries and cause of death.\nThe 22-year-old died from the combined effects of blunt-force head trauma and asphyxia, said Dr. Michelle DiMarco, an associate medical examiner with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.\nAsphyxia relates to a lack of oxygen and can be caused by hanging, manual strangulation or physical compression. DiMarco said she was not able to pinpoint the type of asphyxia Riley suffered.\nRiley also had injuries to her face and a skull fracture – injuries that “could be consistent with a rock,” DiMarco said.\nCNN’s Maxime Tamsett, Dawn Sawyer, Rebekah Riess, Eric Levenson and Sara Smart contributed to this report.\n",

    "content": "A reportedly deadlier strain of mpox has been recorded in the U.S. for the first time, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has announced.\nThis clade I mpox outbreak first arose in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has since spread to several areas around the globe this year, including Central and Eastern Africa, Thailand, Sweden and the U.K.\nWhile an outbreak of clade II mpox has been seen in the U.S. and elsewhere since 2022, the first U.S. clade I case was confirmed this weekend by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH).\n\"CDPH has reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) the first case of clade I mpox in the United States. Clade I is different than clade II, the strain of mpox that has been circulating in California and the United States since 2022,\" the CDPH said. \"This case was confirmed in an individual who recently traveled from Africa and is related to the ongoing outbreak of clade I mpox in Central and Eastern Africa.\"\nMpox is a viral infection that causes painful skin lesions. The primary mode of transmission is via direct contact with these skin lesions or body fluids, which can include sexual contact or other forms of close physical contact with humans or animals. Men who have sex with men are at particular risk of catching the virus, however.\nThe CDC says that \"data from affected countries indicate that a large proportion of clade I mpox cases among adults were associated with heterosexual contact.\"\nSo how dangerous is clade I, compared with clade II?\nClade I and clade II are the two major genetic groups of the Mpox virus, a zoonotic virus in the same family as smallpox (orthopoxvirus). Clade I originates mainly in Central Africa and tends to cause more severe disease, compared with clade II, which is associated with West Africa. The CDC says clade I has historically caused more deaths than clade II, with up to 10 percent of patients dying, but cases outside of Africa appear to have a much lower fatality rate.\nThe CDC continues: \"While outbreaks of clade I mpox used to have death rates around 3 percent-11 percent, more recent outbreaks have had death rates as low as approximately 1 percent when patients received good medical oversight and supportive clinical care. Death rates are expected to be much lower in countries with stronger healthcare systems and treatment options, including the United States.\"\n\"Current data supports that subclade Ib has a lower death rate of less than 1 percent both in and outside of Africa,\" the CDC adds.\nOf the travel-associated clade I mpox cases outside of Africa—which are all caused by the clade I subclade Ib—no deaths have been recorded.\n\"Clade Ib mpox arose in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) just over a year ago. Both clades Ia and Ib are focussed in the DRC,\" Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the U.K.'s University of East Anglia, said in a statement.\nHe went on: \"Clade Ia predominantly affects children and it is believed that many of these infections are acquired from contact with infected animals. Clade Ib is mostly spreading between adults through intimate and sexual contact. Recently, however, clade Ib does seem to be affecting children more, at least within the DRC.\"\nThe CDC says that the \"risk of clade I mpox to the public in the United States remains low.\"\nThis year, over 12,000 cases of clade I mpox have been recorded between January 1 and November 15, with at least 47 deaths occurring across Burundi, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Uganda.\n\"Historically, only Cameroon in West Africa had cases of both clade I and clade II mpox, but they were seen in different parts of the country,\" the CDC says. \"To date, no other country has reported cases due to both clades, with the exception of the recent travel-associated clade I cases in Germany, India, Sweden, Thailand, the United Kingdom, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.\"\nFortunately, clade I mpox seems to be preventable, thanks to the Jynneos vaccine that was widely distributed over the past few years in the wake of the clade II outbreak.\n\"Mpox is not that infectious unless with very close contact,\" Hunter said. \"Early reports were that clade 1 infections are more severe than clade 2 infections and this caused particular concern. However, it is not clear how much of that difference in severity was driven by the poorer health care facilities in DRC compared to West Africa or by the intrinsic virulence of the virus.\"\nHe went on: \"It is likely that if mpox clade 1b does spread in Europe, it would spread predominantly in the same sexual networks that clade 2b spreads in. It is unlikely that we will see a similar epidemic with clade 1b as we saw with clade 2b. The reason for this is that vaccine given for 2b is also effective against 1b and people who have had an infection with 2b will also have reasonable protection against 1b, though not 100 percent.\"\nThe clade I patient in California is currently recovering at home.\nThe CDPH said: \"The affected individual received health care in San Mateo County based on their travel history and symptoms. The individual is isolating at home and recovering. People who had close contact with this individual are being contacted by public health workers, but there is no concern or evidence that mpox clade I is currently spreading between individuals in California or the United States.\"\nIs there a health problem that's worrying you?

    "content": "Japan's Mount Fuji has finally been coated in white after it saw its first-ever recorded snow-free October.\nThe mountain received its first snowfall on November 6, marking the latest first snow since records began some 130 years ago, beating the previous record of October 26 that was set in 1955 and matched in 2016.\nDespite the November 6 snowfall, NASA images show that just days later —November 9—this snow had already disappeared.\nThe images, captured by the OLI (Operational Land Imager) on the Landsat 8 satellite, reveal Mount Fuji's brown slopes on November 9, in contrast to the white peak from October 30, 2023, snapped by the OLI-2 on Landsat 9. In 2023, the mountain received its first snow on October 5.\nThe 12,388-foot-high volcano usually reports its first snowfall around October 2, so this year's snow came more than a month later. This comes after Japan had its joint-hottest summer on record, according to the Japan Times, with temperatures 3.17 degrees F warmer than the 1991–2020 average between June and August. October was also abnormally warm, with temperatures between 9 and 14 degrees F higher than normal for this time of year.\n\"Temperatures were high this summer, and these high temperatures continued into September, deterring cold air,\" Yutaka Katsuta, a forecaster at Japan's Kofu Local Meteorological Office, told Agence France-Presse.\nThe summit of Fuji itself was also warmer than usual this October, with an average temperature of 34.9 degrees F, compared to the average October temperature of 28.4 degrees F.\nClimate change is causing global temperatures to rise, resulting in air near mountain ranges becoming warmer. Precipitation that would typically fall as snow at higher altitudes may therefore instead fall as rain.\nOne paper published in the journal Nature at the beginning of 2024 revealed that human-caused climate change is a major driver of the loss of snowpacks around the Northern Hemisphere.\nAdditionally, a new report from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) found that this October was the second-hottest October on record, with average global temperatures 1.44 degrees F higher than the 1991-2020 average, and 4.97 degrees F higher than average preindustrial temperatures for October.\nAccording to the report, 2024 is extremely likely to be the hottest year ever recorded.\n\"After 10 months of 2024 it is now virtually certain that 2024 will be the warmest year on record and the first year of more than 1.5 C [2.7 F] above pre-industrial levels according to the ERA5 dataset,\" Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), said in a statement.\nIn the weeks since November began, Mount Fuji has seen more snowfall, returning to its traditional sight as a snowcapped wonder.\nDo you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?

Like if I do want it, if I do think this is the way I want to live, I can speak up and that can be accepted,” she said in a video statement.\nIbrahimi was 15 when the Taliban moved into Kabul and seized power after the chaotic withdrawal of the US and its allies following a 20-year occupation, returning the nation to theocratic rule.\nWith the help of the 30 Birds Foundation, Ibrahimi fled Afghanistan with her family — first to Pakistan and then Canada, where she continues to advocate for Afghan girls.\nShe co-founded “Her Story,” which encourages Afghan girls to share their stories, spotlighting the voices of those still in Afghanistan.\n“Every single day I think of those girls who are left behind in Afghanistan, left with no hope. In Canada, I make decisions about my life and embrace the person I aspire to be, but what about them?” Ibrahimi said in a speech to the Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy last year.\nRelated article\nA year ago, she drank battery acid to escape life under the Taliban. Today, she has a message for other Afghan girls\nAfter the Taliban took power, they closed schools for girls over 12. Teenage girls and women are not allowed to study or work and can only leave the house with a male relative. They can’t talk in public and must cover themselves head to toe, their eyes downcast to avoid accusations of impropriety. They aren’t allowed to use parks, gyms and other public facilities. Nor can they travel without permission.\nThe restrictions are part of a dramatic reversal of freedoms gained over two decades since the last time the Taliban ruled Afghanistan.\nLast week, the Taliban carried out a public execution, drawing condemnation from senior United Nations officials who called for an immediate end to such practices.\nThe UN’s Special Rapporteur to Afghanistan, Richard Bennett, said the execution was a “clear violation of human rights.” Bennett has been banned from Afghanistan by the Taliban, who have accused him of spreading propaganda.\nGermany, Australia, Canada and the Netherlands have accused the hardline Islamist group of violating the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.\nThe Taliban has previously said it was “absurd” to accuse Afghanistan’s leaders of gender discrimination. “Human rights are protected in Afghanistan and no one is discriminated,” said spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat Fitrat.\n",

    "content": "In the first quarter of this year, the price of bitcoin broke records in the wake of approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission for the first exchange-traded spot bitcoin funds. The cryptocurrency topped $70,000 in March, according to coinmarketcap.com.\nThen, with crypto advocates buoyed by Donald Trump’s win in the US presidential election this month, the price of bitcoin hit a record $80,000 less than two weeks ago.\nAnd as of Monday this week, it was trading north of $90,000.\nRelated article\nThe crypto industry plowed tens of millions into the election. Now, it’s looking for a return on that investment\nBitcoin evangelists are confident it will keep climbing as they anticipate a friendlier regulatory environment under the new administration. Many think bitcoin is a great tool to build generational wealth. And some are even advocating for the US to create a strategic bitcoin reserve, which MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor told CNBC is a way for the US to “buy the future.”\nIn the first decade after bitcoin’s creation in 2009, the financial planning world was reluctant to consider crypto assets as a serious option for most individual investors. But in the past few years, education about crypto assets has been made more available to professionals. For example, the Financial Planning Association now offers three continuing education courses on crypto, according to FPA president-elect Paul Brahim.\nSo it’s easy to wonder if maybe it’s time to consider investing in bitcoin. We reached out to some financial advisers to see what guidance they offer clients interested in doing so for the first time.\nBitcoin is the oldest and best known of all crypto coins. Its creator — the ever-anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto — set things up so that there can never be more than 21 million bitcoins in existence.\nUnlike other assets that are valued based on tangible components — for example, a company’s goods and services or a natural resource — bitcoin is considered a store of value, the price of which depends strictly on what others are willing to pay for it.\nIts pricing is highly volatile — and therefore highly risky. For all its nosebleed ascents, bitcoin also has had some gut-punching plunges. Between November 2021 and November 2022, for example, the price of bitcoin dropped 75%, from $64,455 to $16,196, according to data on coinmarketcap.com.\nWhile it’s called a currency — and in some instances can be used like money — bitcoin is not legal tender in the United States or most other countries. And it is a much more complicated transaction for the individual who uses it to buy and sell things, especially when it comes to reporting the transactions on their taxes.\nWhen asked what role bitcoin might play in a person’s overall financial investment and savings portfolio — which you might use to buy a house, start a family, pay for college or save for retirement — one strong area of consensus among planners is to not invest any money in bitcoin for anything you must do in the next five years.\nRelated article\nSEC gives bitcoin ETFs the green light\n“Due to its volatility, I would definitely avoid using bitcoin for short-term savings goals. And for the same reason, I would recommend only allocating a very small percentage of my long-term investment strategy to it,” said Trent Porter, a certified financial planner and certified public accountant at Priority Financial Partners. He advises his clients who insist on exposure to limit their portfolio allocation to bitcoin to no more than 5%.\nCFP Mike Turi, a founding partner of Upbeat Wealth who is also an accredited portfolio management adviser, is more conservative. He doesn’t recommend clients allocate more than 3% to bitcoin, if they allocate any at all.\n“I would not recommend using bitcoin as the main strategy to achieve your financial goals. If it’s extra investable money that can help you get there faster? Sure. However, don’t miss out on valuable opportunities by overexposing yourself to an asset that you might not fully understand,” Turi said.\nFrom Pulse Financial Planning CFP Matt Elliott’s perspective, tax-advantaged 529 plans will always be the better option for college because they can be diversified and carry less risk. “It is one thing to bet your money on crypto, but another to bet a child’s college savings on it,” he said.\nElliott, however, can see a small role for bitcoin in a long-term retirement portfolio. He recommends his clients use a “core and explore” strategy. “Ninety-five percent of your assets should be in a core, well-diversified portfolio that is designed with your timeframe and risk tolerance in mind. The other 5% can be used for more speculative investments (such as crypto) if you have little debt and are willing to accept the risk of losing what you put in,” he said.\nWhether bitcoin make sense for you depends as much on your circumstances and preferences as it does on the facts of the asset itself.\n“Before you invest in bitcoin for any reason, ask yourself if it were to drop 50% or more, would you be left in a pinch? If the answer is yes, you should reconsider,” said Porter, who notes that even if regulatory risk does go down for crypto assets during the Trump administration “by no means has the overall risk changed significantly.”\nTuri suggests getting real with what you’ll be able to live with. “I still see bitcoin more as a gamble than a reliable investment. Is it a risk you can afford to take? Consult your future self. What will happen if it doesn’t work out?” he said.\nIf you do invest, set some ground rules for yourself from the jump. “The most challenging aspect of the bitcoin craze is that more retail investors are entering the market at its peak when euphoria is highest,” Turi said. “On the flip side, they’ve never really established an exit strategy. …Investors need to set their exit price to avoid being driven by emotion.”\nIf you decide you do want to put some money into bitcoin, you can buy it directly and store it either in your own virtual wallet or on a digital asset platform like Coinbase. But both options can get complicated and carry risks. [Here is a long list of storage options and their pros and cons.]\nOr you can get access to it more simply and safely by buying into one of the new SEC-regulated spot bitcoin ETFs. Investors have poured nearly $28 billion on net into these ETFs, and their combined net asset value was approaching $96 billion as of Friday, according to data from Morningstar Direct.\nUsing a bitcoin ETF for exposure is the easiest option for most individuals who are not dedicated crypto investing experts.\n“Due to risks such as cybersecurity threats and the possibility of losing private keys, holding bitcoin through an SEC-regulated ETF is by far the safest option,” Porter said.\n",

    "content": "Weight loss drugs such as Wegovy and Ozempic have been hailed worldwide as revolutionary for medicine. In the United Kingdom, the government is hoping they might also improve public finances, eyeing their use to help unemployed people re-enter the workforce and ultimately save money on health care.\n“For many people, these weight-loss jabs will be life-changing, help them get back to work, and ease the demands on our NHS [National Health Service],” British Health Secretary Wes Streeting wrote recently in The Telegraph newspaper.\nStreeting added that obesity is “placing significant burden on our health service,” costing the NHS £11 billion ($14 billion) annually and leading people to take an average of four more sick days each year, which hurts the economy.\nTo counter that, the government is funding a five-year trial of the weight loss drug Mounjaro, or tirzepatide, in conjunction with the drug manufacturer Eli Lilly, which will collect data on participants’ quality of life and changes to their employment status and sick day use.\nBut the proposals have sparked backlash from healthcare professionals, who say that new pharmaceutical treatments have resulted in massive  demand that the country’s public health system can’t cope with.\nAdditional measures to prevent obesity in the first place are desperately needed, health experts say.\nThere’s no question about the issue of obesity in the UK – at least 29% of adults in England are obese, as are 15% of children between the ages of 2 and 15, according to the latest Health Survey for England, which used 2022 data.\nObesity is the second most common cause of preventable death in England, after smoking, according to government health data. It’s also a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dementia, liver disease and several cancers.\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said that his government needs to “think differently” about how to reduce pressure on the country’s national health care system, overburdened amid staffing shortages and funding pressures. Part of that new thinking is exploring weight loss drugs.\nYet obesity experts and healthcare professionals say that because the health system is already overloaded, drugs are hard to administer at scale and solutions need to go much deeper.\nRelated article\nDr. Sanjay Gupta: Blockbuster weight loss drugs are revealing what we still don’t understand about obesity\n“The idea that this is the solution to obesity is a complete fantasy. We still need to prevent as many cases as possible,” said Alfred Slade, government affairs lead at the Obesity Health Alliance, a coalition of organizations that work together to reduce the condition across the UK.\nThe OHA has crunched the numbers on existing weight loss drugs like Wegovy, the brand name for the appetite suppressant semaglutide. The conclusion? It’s nearly impossible to make it widely available.\nCurrently, about 4.1 million people living with excess weight meet the criteria to get Wegovy through England’s national healthcare system. But fewer than 50,000 people per year will actually receive the treatment due to underfunding for NHS services and staffing levels, even with additional financing in the coming years, according to the alliance, citing NHS estimates.\n“We are talking about fractions of fractions of fractions of people, even under a very expensive expansion of current access to treatment,” Slade told CNN. “We are supportive of these treatments for those that they are medically appropriate for, but they are not a replacement for the need to prevent as many cases of obesity as possible… and they are also not going to be a viable population-level solution indefinitely.”\nTo improve access, the government is also expanding the use of the drug Mounjaro, or tirzepatide, for obesity patients in addition to Type 2 diabetes patients. The health ministry claims that up to 250,000 people with the greatest need could receive it over the next three years.\nThe alliance says it’s not clear how the government will pay for the drugs, or how it plans to fund “wraparound support” that is essential alongside these prescriptions, such as dietary advice and physical activity support to ensure patients don’t lose muscle mass as well as fat.\nThe government trial studying links between weight loss drugs and employment is also raising alarm bells among healthcare experts, who argue that medical need should always be the driving factor behind prescriptions.\n“Obesity management services should be available to all who could benefit but where prioritization has to be made, this must be done based on clinical need not the potential economic output of the patient,” wrote Jack Doughty, a senior policy officer at Diabetes UK, in a blog post.\nThe UK’s health ministry has been clear that the NHS will continue to treat people based on clinical need and not prioritize those who are unemployed.\n“This government is committed to urgently tackling this issue head on, shifting our focus from treatment to prevention as part of our 10-Year Health Plan,” a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said in a statement to CNN, adding that the government is also working to restrict junk food advertising and limit schoolchildren’s access to fast food.\nA key issue with weight loss drugs is that they are “dealing with the symptom, not the cause” of obesity, according to Martin White, professor of population health research at the University of Cambridge. Experts argue you need to tackle both.\n“You are kind of ‘medicalizing’ a problem that is really a societal problem,” White told CNN, highlighting that the rapid rise of obesity rates mirrors the rise of processed foods and fast food in society, as more cheap ingredients like sugar, fats and salt creep into everyone’s diets.\n“It’s a whole population problem, not a small number of individuals,” White said. “We have to work out ways to change the context or the environment that is leading people to eat that many excess calories.”\nOne way is to implement stronger taxes on unhealthy products.\nFor example, the UK’s tax on sugary soft drinks has already resulted in manufacturers reducing the amount of sugar in sodas, and studies indicate that price increases are deterring some consumers. There are growing calls to tax food products with sugar and salt in a similar way.\nRelated article\nWhat are your questions about weight loss drugs?\nExperts are also calling for stronger marketing regulations to prevent unhealthy foods from being advertised to children. In October 2025, a watershed law that prevents junk food advertising before 9 p.m. on TV, streaming services and online will come into force in the UK.\nAnother policy solution is to require healthier food to be served in public-sector facilities, like schools, hospitals and prisons. White said that kind of intervention could also be applied to the private sector, if offices and corporate caterers are required to serve healthier food.\nIn schools, experts say there are also problems with implementing the existing regulations for healthy food, which is another area that could benefit from more oversight and investment. For example, one government report has called for more funding to widen access to free and nutritious school meals.\n“Increasingly, what we’ve seen is that kids are starting to put on weight from a very early age,” White added. “But if you can prevent it really early, then the cost savings in terms of health care become huge.”\nOf course, changing an entire food system is harder than prescribing a drug. But tackling an obesity problem that impacts roughly one-third of British adults will require multiple solutions, across all sectors of society.\n“There is no such thing as a silver bullet for obesity,” the Obesity Health Alliance emphasized.\n",

    "content": "A Chinese spy plane unintentionally entered Japanese airspace in August while taking evasive action after encountering turbulence over the contested East China Sea, Beijing explained to Tokyo.\nThe August 26 incident, which occurred off the Danjo Islands in the southwestern prefecture of Nagasaki and lasted for about two minutes, was the first such intrusion on record. The Japanese air force sent fighter aircraft to intercept a Chinese Y-9 intelligence-gathering aircraft.\nThe intrusion came after a Japanese destroyer sailed into Chinese territorial waters on July 4. It was tasked with spying on a live-fire exercise off China's eastern province of Zhejiang and transited for about 20 minutes before exiting the waters.\nBoth governments in Beijing and Tokyo claim the Japan-controlled Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, also known as the Diaoyu Islands in China. Chinese military aircraft have been operating around Japan, a security ally of the United States, on a regular basis.\nChina's explanation of the aerial intrusion was revealed by Japanese government officials to the media on Tuesday, who said the incident was \"a grave violation\" of Japan's sovereignty and \"totally unacceptable.\"\nNewsweek has contacted the defense and foreign ministries in Beijing for comment via email.\nTurbulence forced the spy plane to \"take evasive action\" that resulted in its entry into Japanese airspace for a short period of time, Beijing claimed.\n\"It was a technical issue and there was no intention to enter a territorial airspace,\" the Chinese government was quoted as saying.\nHowever, a Japanese official told the media that weather conditions at the time of the incident would not be have affected any flights and that Japanese fighter jets scrambled in response to the incursion did not report any turbulence.\nFollowing the incident, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian suggested that the intrusion may have been unintentional.\n\"China has no intention of intruding into the airspace of any country,\" Lin said at a press conference in Beijing on August 27.\nJapan has established an air defense zone around the country, where its air force regularly scrambles to intercept Chinese and Russian military aircraft. The zone is not considered sovereign airspace, which typically ends 12 nautical miles from a country's shores.\nAccording to the defense ministry in Tokyo, Japanese fighter jets were scrambled 54 times in October to intercept foreign military aircraft suspected of airspace violations. Russian aircraft were involved on 22 occasions and Chinese planes 32 times.\n",

    "content": "In 2021, I was cruising along with a project about memoirs that mention psychotherapy, when I was diagnosed with stage 4 thyroid cancer.\nI underwent surgery, radiation and chemo and remain on powerful medications that seem to be working, albeit with side effects.\nAnd for the record: I had no symptoms. Swelling in my thyroid was picked up on a calcium scan for my heart, which led to a biopsy and the grim diagnosis.\nMy diagnosis sent me back to the drawing board, and it led me to reevaluate my life as a psychologist and philosopher (including my own ample history in therapy).\nI decided that I needed to add cancer memoirs to my project, and so I read scores of them.\nThere is a standard kind of memoir in which one battles against cancer and prevails, attaining the enviable status of being cancer-free. Such narratives reflect the hopefulness of the American character, but they may portray a wish more than reality.\nAs Christopher Hitchens amusingly reminds us in his memoir, Hitch 22: \"I am not fighting cancer, cancer is fighting me.\"\nMany people who get cancer die from cancer. This happens, even in our age, of extraordinary progress in cancer treatment.\nThe problem with reveling in the language of being \"cancer-free\" is the implied comparison to those whose fate might be less fortunate. Not to mention the lamentable reality that people who ring the bell and resume their lives sometimes do not stay in remission.\nIn her memoir, The Undying, Anne Boyers astutely notes: \"If she lives, she will be heroic. If she dies, she will be a plot point.\"\nThe cancer memoirists that I have appreciated the most exhibit courage in reckoning with their fate.\nAn extraordinary example is found in Tallu Schuyler Quinn's memoir, What We Wish Were True, where she is fully cognizant that she is dying from brain cancer (a glioblastoma). She is 42 years old, and the memoir was published posthumously.\nQuinn is a minister and a spiritual person, also the founder of the Nashville Food Project. She reflects on how facing her own death \"requires an active release and deep letting go of nearly all I hold dear.\" Nevertheless, cancer allows her to feel more deeply in the present, which she finds both surprising and gratifying. God is her constant companion.\nI cannot say the same for myself; nonetheless, I connected with her soul, which marched with overflowing integrity beyond this life.\nThe cancer memoir that affected me profoundly is not a recent one (published more than 40 years ago). Audre Lorde's Cancer Journals powerfully captures the vicissitudes of managing a breast cancer diagnosis.\nShe does not obscure that cancer entails loss, and she articulates a challenge that drifts into focus: making death become part of being alive. As Lorde puts it: \"There must be some way to integrate death into living, neither ignoring it nor giving in to it.\"\nCancer acts to concentrate our attention, precisely because death has made its presence felt.\nEven if death is not imminent, there is no going backward from the specter of death. Yet, Lorde discerns a path forward: \"I am learning to live beyond fear by living through it, and in the process learning to turn fury at my own limitation into some more creative energy.\"\nHaving cancer intensifies our emotions, and Lorde's feistiness is revealed in protesting the expectation that a prosthesis is obligatory after her mastectomy. Lorde lived for more than a decade after her treatment, before succumbing to other forms (liver and ovarian) of cancer.\nI found consolation in these memoirs, identifying with the struggle to hang onto and forge a meaningful life. I have experienced an intensification of emotions, as Quinn and Lorde suggest.\nI have also experienced something that XiXi's Mourning a Breast emphasizes: A new relation to my body, in particular, a sensitivity to tune into it and listen, which at moments is painful, but overall, surprisingly fulfilling.\nIronically, too, my project has been altered with the addition of my personal life, a therapist's history in therapy, to my readings of others. I would not say that I am thankful for having cancer, but I am grateful for the cancer memoirs I have had the opportunity to contemplate and digest.\nI consider it a matter of good fortune to encounter people who fully grasp their bad fortune and have glanced into the abyss, yet manage to preserve, and possibly deepen, their vitality and humanity.\nThe memoirs that have stuck with me are not uplifting; they might well seem morbid.\nNonetheless, perhaps engaging morbidity has a connotation that is both beneficial and healthy. Living as if death does not exist is an illusion, and being prompted to live with an awareness of death can contribute to feeling more alive.\nElliot L.

    "content": "Today, news media faces a number of structural challenges: deepening polarization, diminishing trust and a stark decline in reader engagement.\nAt Newsweek, we've delved deeply into the forces driving us here. One way we're addressing these concerns is the Fairness Meter, which allows readers to hold us accountable by rating an article's fairness on a five-way scale. Our fairness meter can be found at the bottom of select articles across Newsweek's editorial content and will help maintain a high standard of integrity, transparency, and accountability.\nThe landscape of polarization and eroding trust\nMedia's increasing polarization owes much to the dominance of social media, but the challenges began even before that with the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987.\nThis policy, which mandated the inclusion of diverse viewpoints, once ensured a breadth of perspectives in broadcast journalism — a formal balance that lent fairness and credibility to the format. Its removal marked the first shift toward what we see today: more extreme and polarized media narratives. Gallup's polls from 2021 and 2022 show that only 34% of Americans trust mass media, with a pronounced partisan divide — 70% of Democrats versus a mere 14% of Republicans trust mass media outlets.\nThis erosion of trust in news media is not an isolated phenomenon. It's part of a broader moment in which public confidence in many institutions has been waning. In an age when misinformation can spread rapidly over social media, the role of responsible media in providing accurate and unbiased information has become more important than ever. We must do what we can to restore this trust, and it begins at the core of the news product.\nChanging dynamics of reader participation\nParallel to the issue of trust is the evolution of reader participation. The digital age has transformed how audiences interact with news content.\nPost-2016 trends indicate a decline in engagement with traditional news outlets, particularly among younger demographics. Young people increasingly bypass traditional news platforms, turning instead to social media feeds and other digital channels for their news and information.\nThis shift has significant implications for how news organizations engage with their audiences and maintain relevance in the digital era.\nThe Fairness Meter\nNewsweek's Fairness Meter is one of our responses. First, it represents a commitment to deepening trust and enhancing reader engagement by involving our audience in the direct evaluation of our content. Second, the tool redefines the more traditional comment-based systems, instead opting for a structured and consistent way for readers to express their views on the fairness of our articles, providing a concrete method for readers to help shape and sharpen our journalistic tenets.\nHere's some of what we've learned after placing the Fairness Meter on over 1,000 stories since it was activated in September 2023.\nThe aspirations of the Fairness Meter aim to go beyond just gauging perceptions of fairness. It's one step in the direction of restoring trust in the relationship between the public and the news media.\nRepatriating news engagement to the news property\nOver time, social media has usurped news organizations as the forum for discussion and debate of news and current events. One byproduct has been the formation of information echo chambers, which often come to confirm the existing biases of different groupings of users. Social platforms — with finely tuned algorithms designed to amplify engagement — frequently prioritize sensational and controversial content, perspectives and comments, fueling what could be referred to as \"enragement engagement.\"\nThis shift has effectively taken over much of the discourse that was once a feature of news platforms. The Fairness Meter is an initiative to bring back reader engagement to the news platform itself.\nThe end of the ivory tower: A call for public accountability\nThe modern media landscape needs a fundamental shift in how news outlets address reader perceptions and engagement. The era of the journalistic \"ivory tower\" — where media outlets operate in isolation from their audience — is over. Today's media must open itself up to public accountability. The Fairness Meter is one way of demonstrating this new approach, allowing readers to actively participate in shaping the stories our journalists report on.\nIgnoring the imperative for engagement and transparency comes with significant risks. The decline in public trust and reader engagement on news platforms is a clear signal. This growing distrust, exacerbated by digital echo chambers and social media-fueled confirmation biases, threatens the foundation of credible journalism.\nThe Fairness Meter is not merely a feedback tool; it fosters dialogue and understanding and demonstrates respect for our audience's intelligence, acknowledging their critical role in shaping the way that we in the media work.\nOriginally published on Poynter.org\n",

    "content": "Ukrainians are changing their minds on the Russia-Ukraine war, and just over half now want to negotiate an end to it, according to a new poll by Gallup.\nThe survey, conducted in August and October, found 52 percent of Ukrainians favor peace talks \"as soon as possible,\" 38 percent believe they should keep fighting, and nine percent don't know or refused to answer.\nA majority (52 percent) also felt that Ukraine should be open to making some territorial concessions as a part of a peace deal, with 38 percent disagreeing.\nThe poll, which was conducted among a sample size of 1,000 respondents each year with a 3 percent margin of error, showed that after 1,000 days at war with Russia, Ukrainians' views have changed drastically since 2022.\nThen, 73 percent felt their country should fight until victory. Only 22 percent felt Kyiv should negotiate an end to the war as soon as possible.\nNewsweek reached out to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine and Gallup for comment via email.\nBenedict Vigers, senior global newswriter at Gallup, told Newsweek: \"Our latest polling from Ukraine shows that after more than two years of war, many Ukrainians now think their country should seek to negotiate an ending to the war as soon as possible.\n\"Public opinion has changed significantly as the war has progressed, with the percentage who want Ukraine to negotiate a quick ending doubling since 2023 (from 22 percent to 52 percent). Support for continuing to fight until victory has not only fallen in the regions closest to the front line, but across the whole country, dipping below 50 percent in all regions of Ukraine this year.\"\nThe desire to fight until victorious began to noticeably decline in 2023, when 63 percent of Ukrainians wanted to continue fighting, compared to 27 percent who wanted to negotiate an ending.\nSupport for continued fighting has declined everywhere this year. In previous years, Eastern and Southern Ukraine, where most of the fighting has taken place, were most opposed to the war, while the less affected areas in Northern and Western Ukraine were keen to pursue victory, Gallup found.\nThe Ukrainians' concept of victory has also changed since the beginning of the war. In 2022, the vast majority (92 percent) believed that victory meant regaining territory lost since 2014, including Crimea. That dropped to 81 percent this year.\nThe majority of respondents favored the E.U. as peace brokers, at 70 percent, or the U.K, at 63 percent. The U.S was backed by roughly half the respondents for a role in the negotiations.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has previously said that he would end the war in Ukraine \"within 24 hours\" of taking office and, since his reelection, details of his advisers' plans have emerged, including pushing for a ceasefire while freezing borders at the current front lines.\nIn this scenario, Russia would retain the territory it has seized and aspects of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky's peace plan, notably joining NATO, would not happen.\nNewsweek has reached out to the Trump transition team for comment via email.\nZelensky has previously dismissed Trump's peace plan, and the Ukrainian leader has also spoken defiantly against accepting a compromise.\n\"We are an independent country. And during this war, both our people and I personally, in negotiations with the United States, with Trump, Biden, and European leaders, have proved that the rhetoric of 'sit and listen' does not work with us,\" he said in an interview with Ukrainian Radio.\nZelensky is determined to secure a future safe from Russia. He posted on X, formerly Twitter: \"1,000 days of war. 1,000 days since Ukrainians kicked Putin in the teeth. We must end this war—and end it justly. But we must do it in a way that ensures Putin, no matter how toothless, never returns to Ukraine. We need to make it certain.\"\nUpdate, 11/20/2024, 5:07 a.m. ET: This article was updated to include additional information.\n",

    "content": "A number of Taylor Swift's fans have taken to social media to criticize the pricing of the pop star's merchandise—specifically a branded candle.\nSwift's website offers a range of products ranging from apparel to a selection of trinkets and collectibles. And while her fans—who are dubbed \"Swifties\"—are known for their devotion to the star, some have complained about the pricing.\nOn Swift's website, an 8oz candle is offered for $50. The soy candle's glass jar and box are branded with the name of the star's most recent album, The Tortured Poets Department. Per the website, the candle \"features an oud and amber scent.\"\nSharing a screenshot of the candle in question, which is part of Swift's holiday collection, one fan wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \"I appreciate Taylor's merch, but $50 for [an] 8 ounce candle is crazy.\"\nAnother commented: Come on @taylorswift13. I love you girl but this candle is f****** ridiculous. Your fans should not be taken advantage of like this.\"\nOn fan said that the candle \"better smells like Taylor herself,\" while another stated: \"$50 for a candle? I don't even like paying $10 for a candle I can actually smell before purchasing.\"\n\"Is it just me or is $50 insane for a candle?\" asked another.\n\"Taylor Swift herself better come and light the candle for that price,\" read one comment.\nAdding another product to their complaint, another fan chimed in: \"I love you Taylor, but $75 for a blanket and $50 for a candle?!\"\nNewsweek has contacted a representative of Swift via email for comment.\nWhile the price point on a Swift-branded candle hasn't won the highest praise, products on her website sparked a conversation of a different kind last week.\nOn November 13, fans shared screenshots showing three sweaters placed on top of one another on Swift's website. The image has been taken as a hint that Swift will be releasing recordings of her 2006 debut album, Taylor Swift, and her 2017 album Reputation.\n\"WAIT.... This is an Easter egg,\" one fan wrote on X of the image. \"WE ARE GETTING DEBUT TV BEFORE SUMMER AND THEN AFTER SUMMER WE GET REP TV.\"\nThe \"TV\" in question is \"Taylor's Version,\" representing the re-recordings of earlier albums that Swift has released following a rights dispute with music mogul Scooter Braun. The record executive purchased Big Machine Records, Swift's first label, in 2019, giving him ownership of her first six albums.\nThe post showed the top sweater featuring Taylor Swift's name, followed by another emblazoned with the words \"Summer With You,\" taken from the lyrics of her track \"Cruel Summer.\" The final sweater on the bottom showed the words \"Starry Eyes,\" taken from the lyrics of Swift's track \"Call It What You Want,\" which features on her Reputation album.\nWith the \"Summer\" top serving as the divider, fans have theorized from the post that Swift's version of Taylor Swift will likely be released in the earlier part of the year, while a new Reputation recording will follow in the latter half.\nBack in 2019, after music mogul Braun purchased the rights to Swift's master recordings from her first six albums—before selling them to Shamrock Holdings—Swift announced that she would re-record the albums.\nSince 2021, Swift has released the re-recordings of 2008's Fearless, 2012's Red, 2010's Speak Now, and 2014's 1989. To date, Swift's self-titled debut album and Reputation are the only two of the recordings not yet re-recorded.\nSwift's most recent album, The Tortured Poets Department, was released in April. It was her 11th album.\n",

    "content": "Fast-food giant McDonald's announced a massive $100 million investment package aimed at helping franchise stores recover from a recent E. coli outbreak linked to onions on its Quarter Pounder hamburgers according to the Associated Press.\nThe bulk of the financial commitment—$65 million—will be directed to franchises most severely impacted by the outbreak, which affected multiple states across the western United States. The crisis resulted in 104 reported illnesses, 34 hospitalizations, one death in Colorado, and four cases of serious kidney complications.\nBeyond the direct financial assistance to affected locations, the remaining $35 million will be allocated to enhanced safety protocols and supply chain improvements.\nThe outbreak's impact has been particularly severe in western states. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Colorado reported the highest number with 30 confirmed cases, followed by Montana with 19, Nebraska with 13, and New Mexico with 10.\nAdditional cases were reported across multiple states, including eight each in Utah and Missouri, six in Wyoming, three in Kansas, two in Michigan, and one case each in Iowa, North Carolina, Oregon, Washington, and Wisconsin.\nThe CDC noted that the true number of sick people in this outbreak is likely much higher than reported, as many people recover without medical care and are not tested for E. coli. Additionally, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it typically takes three to four weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.\nThe source of the outbreak was traced to slivered yellow onions supplied by Taylor Farms, which issued a recall on October 22 for thousands of cases distributed to McDonald's restaurants and other food service customers. The FDA has since classified the recalled onions at the highest risk level—Class I—indicating a reasonable probability that exposure to the product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death.\nNewsweek contacted Taylor Farms via email on Saturday for comment.\nThe classification applies to onions distributed to food service facilities across several states, including Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Utah. In its recall notice, Taylor Farms urged customers to stop using the affected product and destroy it.\nFDA testing on recalled onions detected a strain of E. coli with a harmful toxin in one onion sample, though officials noted it did not match the strain responsible for the reported illnesses. Further sample results are still pending. The bacterial strain involved in this outbreak is responsible for approximately 74,000 infections, over 2,000 hospitalizations and 61 deaths in the United States each year, according to CDC data.\nIn response to the crisis, McDonald's removed Quarter Pounders from menus in several affected states during the early days of the outbreak. The company identified an alternate supplier for approximately 900 restaurants that temporarily stopped serving the burgers with onions.\nThe FDA has stated that there does not appear to be a continued food safety concern related to this outbreak at McDonald's restaurants, as the implicated onions are now past their shelf life and no longer in circulation.\nThe financial impact of the outbreak has been significant for many franchise owners. The temporary menu modifications and associated publicity led to noticeable declines in customer traffic and sales, particularly in the affected regions. The newly announced recovery package aims to help these businesses rebuild customer confidence and offset losses incurred during the crisis.\nMcDonald's has now resumed selling Quarter Pounders with slivered onions nationwide, signaling a return to normal operations.\n",

    "content": "On a crisp autumn day in Atlanta, I sat in my office with Tom, a new patient who had just turned 60. Despite his professional success, he was visibly frustrated by the decline in his energy and vitality. He felt his best years were in the rearview mirror and worried he was destined to age in the same slow, painful way as his father and grandfather.\nAs a board-certified male longevity doctor, I understand all too well the feeling of surrender that can accompany the marking of time with every passing birthday. But, based on my almost two decades of experience and research, I knew that three simple but very profound choices had the potential to help change Tom's aging path, preventing him from following in the painful footsteps of previous generations. These simple changes could potentially extend his lifespan and improve the quality of the years ahead of him.\nThe research clearly shows that, on average, men live six fewer years than women. Yet, the gap between men and women isn't as difficult to close as it might appear at first. Even the smallest of choices made consistently can make a huge difference in closing the longevity gap between men and women.\nFrom my practice of anti-aging and regenerative medicine, I've seen firsthand how three evidence-based habits can potentially add years to your life and enhance its quality. These simple habits are easy to learn, take only a few minutes, and can have a lasting impact on health for years to come if practiced consistently.\nConsistent Sleep Schedule\nLet's start with sleep, a cornerstone of longevity and good health that is often brushed over in our world of quick fixes and health gadgets. Creating a schedule of consistent sleep is one of the most transformative practices I have recommended to my patients over the years.\nThe benefits of a good night's sleep are profound, going well beyond just feeling rested the next morning. We set sleep schedules for babies and young children, but somewhere along the way, we lose this practice as we get older.\nResearch shows that men who consistently obtain sufficient sleep live, on average, 4.7 years longer than those who do not. Even more interestingly, they live two years longer than women who also struggle with poor sleep. My maternal grandmother, Martina, who lived to be almost 106 years of age, used to tell me that older people and babies have one thing in common: how much they need to sleep to be in good health.\nOne memorable patient experience was with Dave, a 55-year-old executive who came to me as a new patient with complaints of fatigue, hopelessness, and stress.\nDespite his very demanding corporate job, with weekly travel across time zones, Dave had been hesitant to prioritize sleep, often working late into the night and finding it challenging to wake up early. He had crossed the line from hope into despair, worn down by the continuous deprivation of a good night's sleep. It was taking a toll on his health, and he had not made the connection.\nAfter explaining the benefits of a consistent sleep schedule that includes a regular bedtime and wake-up time with at least seven to eight hours of high-quality sleep, Dave decided to make a small change. He started by going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends, regardless of the time zone he found himself in.\nThe transformation of being consistent with his sleep schedule was remarkable. Within weeks, Dave experienced increased energy levels, a better mood, a renewed sense of optimism, and greater focus. He also noticed a significant reduction in his personal and work-related stress levels. The enhanced quality of his life demonstrated how something as simple as maintaining a regular sleep schedule can significantly impact overall health and longevity.\n12 Minutes a Week of High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)\nNext on the list of simple habits that increase health and longevity is high-intensity interval training (HIIT), a method of exercise that has revolutionized the way we think about fitness. For those of us who feel overwhelmed by the idea of committing to long workouts and can never find the time, HIIT provides a solution.\nThe idea is simple and involves short bursts of intense exercise with equally brief periods of recovery afterward. Just 12 minutes a week of HIIT can dramatically improve heart health, mood, and optimize longevity hormones. The simplicity of HIIT means that even the busiest person can find time for it in their schedule.\nAlex, a 45-year-old divorced father of two young children, was struggling to find time for exercise in his overscheduled personal and work life. Alex was skeptical about the effectiveness of HIIT, but he was willing to try it because it was better than the alternative he had been experiencing of not exercising.\nWe started with two weekly sessions of six minutes each, using a mini stair stepper in his office. Each session included one minute of intense stair-stepping followed by one minute of rest, repeated three times.\nThe results within a few weeks were astounding. Alex's cardiovascular health improved, he felt more energetic, more proactive about his health, and he noticed changes in how his clothes fit. These short bursts of exercise fit seamlessly into his busy life and serve as an example of how even brief, intense workouts can be highly effective.\nIntermittent Fasting (IF)\nFinally, let's shift to the simple habit of intermittent fasting (IF). This approach to eating doesn't require a complete overhaul of your diet, and there is no additional cost associated with it. It is quite simple and free. Instead, it focuses on when you eat. By including periods of fasting in your daily routine, you can decrease your risk of various chronic diseases of aging and enhance your longevity on a cellular level. The flexibility of intermittent fasting means that it can be easily added to your existing lifestyle, making it a viable option for improving your health.\nI recall working with Mike, a 50-year-old struggling with managing his weight and related health problems. Mike was very hesitant about fasting at first. Still, after explaining the evidence-based science behind it, he decided to try it.\nWe agreed on an 8-hour feeding to 16-hour fasting plan, in which Mike ate his meals during an 8-hour window from 10 am to 6 pm every day and fasted for the remaining 16 hours of the day. During this fasting time, he could drink water, decaffeinated tea, and decaffeinated coffee.\nThe impact on Mike's health and well-being was transformative. He lost significant weight and experienced improved energy levels, mental clarity, and focus within a few months. His blood biomarkers for cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, and inflammation significantly improved, and he felt rejuvenated. He was also able to sleep better and eliminate symptoms of indigestion he had been experiencing from eating and drinking alcohol late at night. Intermittent fasting proved to be a simple yet powerful tool in enhancing his overall health and working towards extending his health and longevity.\nThe Power of Small, Simple Changes\nThe power of these habits lies in their simplicity. Consistent sleep, 12 minutes of HIIT per week, and Intermittent Fasting are easy to incorporate into a busy lifestyle and require minimal effort or cost. Yet, they offer profound health benefits and enhance life quality.\nSeeing patients like Tom, Dave, Alex, and Mike—whose names have been changed to protect their privacy—transform their lives with these simple but impactful choices has been incredibly rewarding. Each story reminds me that it's never too late to make small changes that lead to a healthier, longer life.\nAs a longevity expert, my goal is to help men realize their best years are ahead of them, not behind them. You don't have to follow the same slow decline as previous generations. By adopting these simple habits, you can possibly close the longevity gap and significantly improve your health and well-being. Consistency is key, and these small changes can lead to a longer, healthier, and more fulfilling life. Look into making these simple changes yourself, with your doctor's approval, to see how these habits can transform your life.\nAna Casas, MD, is a board-certified physician and expert in Anti-Aging and Regenerative Medicine.

    "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide will help you ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts.\nIn a busy world, the task of getting more movement into your daily life can often get put on the back burner.\nBut there’s a reason to rethink your priorities — getting as active as the top 25% of the US population could extend your life by at least five years, according to a new study published Thursday in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.\n“I was surprised to find that the loss of life years in the USA due to low levels of physical activity might rival the losses due to smoking and high blood pressure,” said senior study author Dr. Lennert Veerman, professor of public health in the School of Medicine and Dentistry at Griffith University in Australia, via email.\nMany studies have examined the connections between physical activity and longevity. In fact, Veerman’s research was inspired by a 2019 study that found the risk of premature death lowered the more physical activity participants did, he said. The activity levels in that study were measured with accelerometers — wearable activity-tracking devices.\nThe 2019 study, along with others, had already shown that when measured with accelerometry, the relationship between physical activity and early death is about twice as strong when compared with levels gauged by surveys or questionnaires, Veerman said.\n“I wondered how that would translate to life expectancy, and how much extra life time a single hour of walking might bring,” Veerman added.\nTo find out, the authors of the latest study used physical activity data captured by hip accelerometers worn — for at least 10 hours on four or more days — by adults who were age 40 or older when participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2003 to 2006.\nThe findings are based on this age group because activity-dependent mortality rates are stable up to age 40; after that, they vary. And the reason for using old activity data is for methodological consistency with the 2019 study, the authors said.\nRelated article\nKnee pain in the US increased 65% over the past 20 years. Easy exercises can help\nThe team then constructed a life table — a way of showing the probabilities of populations living to, or dying by, a certain age. This life table was based on the National Center for Health Statistics’ mortality data for 2017, which the authors assumed was related to the 2003-2006 activity levels.\nBased on this information, the authors projected forward how many people from the 2019 US population would survive in the coming years depending on activity levels, and how much extra life they could gain by increasing them.\nThey found that being as active as the least active quartile of the population would lead to a 5.8-year loss in life expectancy for men and women, bringing the expectancy at birth down from around 78 to around 73. And if all Americans over age 40 were as active as the top quartile, life expectancy would be 83.7 years, which is an increase of 5.3 years. Total activity levels in the lowest quartile were equivalent to walking for 49 minutes at roughly 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) per hour daily. Total activity levels in the second-, third- and fourth-highest quartiles were equivalent to 78, 105 and 160 minutes, respectively.\nThe team also investigated what the potential benefits could be on an individual, rather than population, level — finding that if those who are the least active got an extra 111 minutes of activity per day, they could prolong their life by up to 11 years.\nThe findings “suggest sort of what we’ve already known, which is that physical activity is pretty critical to improve health outcomes (and) improve longevity,” said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver, who wasn’t involved in the study. (Freeman is also a medical adviser for WeWard, an activity-tracking app that also incentivizes users to move by letting them accrue points they can redeem for prizes or charity donations. He hasn’t received any financial compensation.)\nThe authors’ modeling method is strong but does have its limitations since it relies on existing data and provides estimates that are largely theoretical, said Dr. Peter Katzmarzyk, associate executive director for population and public health sciences at the Louisiana State University’s Pennington Biomedical Research Center, via email. Katzmarzyk wasn’t involved in the study.\nRelated article\nDon’t waste time and money on trendy wellness hacks. Try these things that actually work\nThe authors acknowledged there is some evidence that adherence to physical activity guidelines in the United States has improved since the mid-2000s, meaning their projections on life expectancy could be overestimated. The activity levels of the participants in the 2003-2006 study were also measured at just one point in time, which can’t account for changes across their lifetimes.\nBut researchers have already suggested exactly how movement could be linked to longevity.\n“Physical inactivity is associated with the development of several diseases, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and several cancers,” Katzmarzyk said. “Being physically active reduces your risk of developing these conditions and dying from them.”\nIf the idea of becoming more active seems daunting, know that the activity levels of participants in the 2003-2006 study weren’t all from exercise. They wore trackers on their hips for at least 10 waking hours for multiple days, which means the devices captured movements necessary for day-to-day life, too.\nFind more moments to move throughout your day. While your food’s heating up, do some squats or take a lap around your work building instead of scrolling through social media. When you’re running errands, park as far away from stores as possible. Getting coffee with a friend? Catch up during a walk in the park instead of sitting in the coffee shop. Standing desks or desk treadmills can be great to have at work, Freeman said.\nMORE: Exercise quiz: Find the best workouts for you\nAdults need at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise per week, according to the World Health Organization. Every movement counts, Veerman said, so don’t count yourself out if you don’t meet the guidelines.\nThe study found a diminishing returns effect, so exercising for 23 hours a day doesn’t mean you’ll live forever, Freeman said. There is such a thing as too much activity.\nAdditionally, “the authors’ points about enhancing the pedestrian infrastructure … are critical,” said Freeman, who added that patients returning from trips to Europe often tell him they walked 10,000 or 20,000 steps daily.\nRelated article\nIs exercise or medication better for depression? Experts weigh in\n“We need to figure out how to do that here in the States,” he said, “because our expenditures in health care are just completely unsustainable.”\nReducing dependence on cars requires collective action and long-term planning, but everyone can advocate for this change, and some people are already positioned to help make it happen, Veerman said.\n",

    "content": "The United States’ first known case of a more severe strain of mpox was confirmed in California, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Saturday. The risk of clade I mpox to the public remains low, the agency said.\nThe person diagnosed with clade I mpox had recently traveled from Eastern Africa, where an mpox outbreak is ongoing. The person was treated at a local medical facility and released, the CDC said. The person has been isolating at home and their symptoms are improving. The state and CDC are working to identify and follow up with potential contacts.\nRelated article\nCDC says mpox vaccine boosters aren’t needed in the US as questions emerge around waning immunity\nClade II mpox has been circulating in the United States since a large outbreak in 2022 and 2023. A more recent outbreak in Africa is driven by clade I, which is known to cause more severe disease.\nThe subtype that’s responsible for most of the ongoing spread, clade Ib, is relatively new. Travel-related cases of mpox clade Ib have been reported in Germany, India, Kenya, Sweden, Thailand, Zimbabwe, and the United Kingdom. Some countries outside of Africa have also reported locally transmitted cases.\n“The recent travel-associated clade I mpox cases outside of Africa have all been attributed to subclade Ib; there have been no deaths associated with these cases and available data for a subset has detailed relatively mild disease courses,” the CDC said Saturday.\n“Historically, clade I mpox has caused more severe illness and deaths than clade II mpox; however, recent data demonstrate that infections from clade I mpox in the current outbreak may not be as clinically severe as in previous outbreaks. While outbreaks of clade I mpox used to have death rates around 3%-11%, more recent outbreaks have had death rates as low as approximately 1% when patients received good medical oversight and supportive clinical care. Death rates are expected to be much lower in countries with stronger healthcare systems and treatment options, including the United States.”\nThe World Health Organization says the number of mpox cases in Africa has been rising, driven mostly by cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi and Uganda. On November 22, the WHO is set to convene a meeting of its emergency committee on mpox to advise whether the current outbreak still constitutes a public health emergency of international concern.\nMpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is a viral disease related to the now-eradicated smallpox virus. It can spread through close contact such as touching, kissing or sex, as well as through contaminated materials like sheets, clothing and needles, according to the WHO.\nInitial symptoms are typically flu-like — including fever, chills, exhaustion, headache and muscle weakness — often followed by a painful or itchy rash with raised lesions that scab over and resolve over a period of weeks.\nThe CDC says people can protect themselves from mpox by avoiding contact with people with symptoms and contaminated materials such as clothing, bedding, sex toys and toothbrushes. People who are eligible are recommended to get two doses of mpox vaccine.\n",

    "publishedAt": "Nov 20, 2024 at 7:03 AM EST",
    "content": "Donald Trump is facing unexpected opposition from one of his most loyal media supporters, after his favorite newspaper rejected several of his cabinet picks.\nIn an editorial published Tuesday, the New York Post described two of Trump's Cabinet picks as \"dreadful.\"\n\"While most of the Cabinet picks have been excellent, and some of them risky but promising, [Matt] Gaetz and [Tulsi] Gabbard are dreadful,\" the newspaper wrote. \"We plead that he rethinks them.\"\nFormer Florida Rep Matt Gaetz was nominated to be attorney general, while former Democratic Rep Tulsi Gabbard was nominated to be director of National Intelligence.\nGaetz is currently under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for alleged sexual abuse and illicit drug use, allegations he denies. Immediately after his nomination, Gaetz resigned from Congress, temporarily blocking the release of the committee's report on him, days before it was set to go public.\nGaetz is also accused of having sex with a 17-year-old girl on a game table at a July 2017 party, according to the woman's lawyer. Gaetz had been sworn in to his first term in the House in January of that year. He has denied any wrongdoing. Meanwhile, Gabbard previously ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, and has been accused of amplifying Russian propaganda.\n\"They're distracting chaos agents who won't accomplish what Trump wants them to, and will most likely backfire on his agenda,\" the Post wrote of Gaetz and Gabbard.\nThe newspaper has also been critical of Trump's pick for secretary of health and human services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has previously falsely claimed that vaccines cause autism, among other conspiracy theories. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): \"Many studies have looked at whether there is a relationship between vaccines and ASD [autism spectrum disorder]. To date, the studies continue to show that vaccines are not associated with ASD.\"\nIn an opinion article published on Thursday, the editorial board of the New York Post denounced Kennedy Jr. as \"nuts\" and suggested that the nomination could be explained by a worm that he claimed ate part of his brain spreading to Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida.\n\"We sat down with RFK Jr. back in May 2023, when he was still challenging President [Joe] Biden for the Democratic nomination,\" the newspaper's editorial board wrote. \"We came out thinking he's nuts on a lot of fronts...it's hard to see how he's the guy to lead HHS and its staff of 83,000 to practical solutions.\"\nThe board continued: \"Donald Trump won on promises to fix the economy, the border and soaring global disorder; his team needs to focus on delivering change on those fronts—not spend energy either having to defend crackpot theories or trying to control RFK Jr.'s mouth. We fear the worm that he claims ate some of his brain some years ago is contagious and there's been an outbreak at Mar-a-Lago.\"\nThe Post has often reported favorably on Trump during his time as a local property magnate and later reality TV star. After Trump took office in 2017, Axios reported that according to sources close to him, the Post was his preferred paper, with a friend describing it as \"the paper of record for him.\"\nA month before the 2020 presidential election, the Rupert Murdoch-owned title endorsed him, but distanced itself from Trump after he made unfounded accusations that the election had been stolen due to widespread voter fraud.\nTwo years later, in September of 2022, Trump responded to a Post editorial on his Truth Social platform and complained that his \"favorite newspaper\" had now turned against him. The newspaper endorsed the president-elect this year.\nBut the right-wing tabloid may now be turning the tables on the president-elect.\nThe newspaper criticized Gabbard for being \"sympathetic to dictators in Syria and Russia.\" Three days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Gabbard posted on X calling for Ukraine to remain neutral, outside military alliances like NATO. In March 2022, she shared a video claiming there were over 25 US-funded biolabs in Ukraine, based on a disputed Moscow claim, which the U.S. and Ukraine denied. Meanwhile, she has opposed U.S. intervention in Syria and criticized former Democratic President Barack Obama's administration for supporting the Syrian opposition movement against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2015.\nGabbard has often been described as having an isolationist stance on foreign policy, meaning she prefers for the U.S. not to intervene in global conflicts.\nAccording to the New York Post, her \"isolationism\" may cause a problem for Trump.\n\"There's a real fear that Gabbard won't provide President Trump with the intelligence he needs, but rather downplay threats with the intention of isolationism,\" they wrote.\nThe editorial continued: \"Trump has shown that he can balance the demands of a threatening world while working to avoid dragging America into another unnecessary war. He can only do that if he's given frank assessments by a dispassionate intelligence officer. Tulsi Gabbard is not that person.\"\nThe Post also criticized Gaetz, arguing that although may provide the \"disruption\" to the Department of Justice (DOJ) that Trump wishes for, he \"has neither the ethics nor the discipline to rebuild a proper system that will pursue fair prosecutions.\"\n\"The congressman may have convinced Trump that he is the subject of \"lawfare,\" but it's obvious all he wants is an escape hatch,\" the editorial continued. Both Gaetz and Trump have been critical of the DOJ, accusing the department of a political witch hunt against the president-elect, who is currently involved in 4 criminal cases.\n\"The lawfare we have seen against President Trump will do great damage well beyond our time in public service,\" Gaetz told U.S. Attorney-General Merrick Garland during a congressional hearing earlier this year. After confirming Gaetz as his nominee for attorney general, Trump said he will \"root out the systemic corruption at DOJ, and return the department to its true mission of fighting Crime, and upholding our Democracy and Constitution.\"\nBut the New York Post said Gaetz's own run-ins with the law will undermine his credibility to do so.\n\"Gaetz's own run-in with the law diminishes how the Dems relentlessly hounded Trump,\" the newspaper wrote.\n\"Neither Gabbard nor Gaetz are singular figures for what Trump wants to accomplish.\n\"There are plenty of people who can cast a jaundiced eye at our intelligence services and purge the Department of Justice of bias—and do so without a bus full of baggage.\"\nNewsweek has contacted Gabbard and Gaetz, as well as Trump's transition team for comment via email.\nThe New York Post is not alone in its rejection of Trump's cabinet picks. Half of Senate Republicans, including some in senior leadership positions, have privately said they don't see a path for Gaetz to be confirmed by the Senate, NBC News reported. Meanwhile, some Republican lawmakers, like Senator Susan Collins of Maine, have already expressed dismay over Trump picking Gaetz, while some others have refused to say how they will vote on confirming Kennedy Jr.\nA recent poll from Echelon Insights found that Matt Gaetz is by far the least popular pick among American voters for Donald Trump's cabinet.\n",

    "content": "In Indian-administered Kashmir, long before the morning call to prayer reverberates across neighborhoods, the city of Srinagar’s kandurs, or bakers, have fired up their tandoor ovens.\nLocated in the snowy Himalayas, at the northern tip of India, this disputed region between India and Pakistan is a paradise of snowy glaciers, ice-blue lakes, fir-lined mountains, and gushing, stormy rivers. So famed is its beauty that Mogul Emperor Jehangir once remarked, “If there is a heaven on earth, it’s here, it’s here, it’s here.”\nKashmir’s rich history includes the legacy of Buddhist pilgrims, Islamic rulers, Sikh dynasts and Central Asian Silk Road traders, who brought their arts, crafts and rituals to this treasured land that remains one of the world’s most militarized regions, marred with decades of conflict and violence.\nBut beyond the troubled state’s borders, few talk of the artisans who work with flour, water and ghee (clarified butter) to give Kashmiris their daily bread.\nThe region’s rich bread culture is a patchwork of the legacy of the Silk Road, an ancient trade route that connected Europe, the Middle East and Asia along the way. While rice is the staple that’s cooked in households across Kashmir, bread is what drives the local community and economy. Local bakeries churn out roughly 10 kinds of bread a day, each with its own peculiar ritual and time of day to be consumed.\nWith so much traditional knowledge guarded and passed down through generations, Kashmir’s bread culture could qualify for a UNESCO intangible heritage listing and possibly rival France’s boulangerie tradition. So why does no one talk about this culinary legacy?\nMehvish Altaf Rather, a Kashmir-based documentary filmmaker, tried to change that when she made her film “Kandurwan: Baking History,” in 2019. The piece offers a peep into life in the valley, of which the kandurwan (bakery) forms an integral part.\n“I wanted to capture the daily life of Kashmiris and talk about the one thing that everyone can identify with, a love for food,” she tells CNN.\nBothered by the singular narrative around bloodshed and politics emerging from Kashmir, Mehvish turned to another aspect of local culture to tell a larger story.\n“The identity of Kashmiris is constantly threatened, so bread is part of a culture that we hold onto very dearly,” she says, explaining how the kandurwan is a place of congregation and culture in Kashmiri society.\nKandurs, the traditional bakers of Kashmir, use clay tandoor ovens to prepare various breads. This baking tradition is similar to those found throughout Central Asia. The term “tandoor” comes from the Persian word “tanur,” meaning oven. Despite its ancient origins, the technique of using the clay oven for bread making has remained largely unchanged, deeply ingrained in Kashmiri culture.\nOn their way back from the mosque, locals pick up freshly made, crisp-on-the-outside, pillowy-on-the-inside, circular girdas and crunchy, thin lavasas for the entire family. As they wait for the shop boys to wrap up their warm breads in yesterday’s newspaper, locals swap daily news, essential information and, more often than not, gossip.\n“These kandurs are experts in extracting information out of you! The conversation will start with an innocent ‘Did you hear the news?’ and after some raised eyebrows, it will lead to the customer divulging the juiciest bits of news,” says food writer and author Marryam H. Reshii, who lives between Srinagar and New Delhi.\n“Sometimes when my husband takes more than 30 minutes for what is actually a five-minute job of picking up the morning bread, I know he’s catching up on all the local news at the kandurwan.”\nBrought up Catholic in Goa, an erstwhile Portuguese colony that is now India’s sunshine state, Reshii was fascinated by her Kashmiri husband’s bread traditions. They differed vastly from those in Goa, where Portugal’s bread-making techniques blended with local ingredients and tastes.\n“India has a very diverse bread culture, but Kashmir’s is wholly unique,” she explains.\nRelated article\n50 of the world’s best breads\nFor starters, most breads in Kashmir are cooked in an underground tandoor at a kandurwan, while across India, they’re cooked on a pan or baked in an oven.\nBesides girda and lavasa, Kashmir’s bread pantheon includes the croissant-like katlam, kulcha, the bagel-esque, sesame-seed dusted tschowor, the festive sheermal, the flaky bakarkhani and roth, to name a few.\n“There’s a very complex ritual around what one should eat with which bread and at what time of the day. But it’s not documented and no one tells you. You simply have to learn by observation,” says Reshii.\nIn the morning, girda and lavasa are consumed with noon chai, a savory tea made with milk, butter and salt. The breads are also paired with eggs or butter and jam. In the afternoon, one might eat a tschowor, that’s often introduced to outsiders as an equivalent to the bagel.\nThen there’s bakarkhani, served on special occasions. The layered bread is often large, with a diameter that can extend up to 36 inches. It goes well with mutton dishes like lamb rogan josh. Roth, which is sweet, spongy and sometimes studded with dry fruits, is a celebratory food, and a favorite across Hindu and Muslim families in the region.\n“Every Kashmiri has their favorite bread and is partial to their family kandur,”explains Jasleen Marwah, the chef-founder of Folk, a regional Indian cuisine cafe in Mumbai. Her father hailed from Kashmir so for her, summertime equals Kashmir, and Kashmir equals a warm, pillowy girda.\n”Our family’s morning order of girda was seven. I’d always buy eight so that I could eat a freshly baked one on my way home from the kandurwan,” says Marwah. While she enjoyed eating the breads of Kashmir as a child, it was only when she became a professional cook that she realized the sheer weight and heft this culinary legacy holds.\n“All these breads are as technique-driven as a croissant, bagel or sourdough. For many of them, the process is very similar to making a sourdough,” she says.\nMarwah believes that since much of this tradition is passed down orally and has not been officially documented, few outside the region can truly appreciate it.\nNow, she and a host of other chefs across India are hoping to change that. On Marwah’s menu at Folk, she offers a few Kashmiri breads adjusted in recipe and size for an office-going lunch crowd in Mumbai.\nPrateek Sadhu, one of India’s most celebrated chefs, grew up in Kashmir but was forced to leave his home in the early 1990s when violence escalated.\n“As immigrants, the only thing we could carry with us was food and language,” he explains, as he presents a 14-course meal at his fine dining restaurant Naar, located in the foothills of the Himalayas in India’s Himachal Pradesh.\nOne of the courses he offers is the bakarkhani that he serves with five condiments from the Himalayan belt along with smoked pork.\nOver in Mumbai, at Masque, (#23 on Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants List), chef Varun Totlani has served a variety of breads from Kashmir, including tschowor, katlam and tzir tzcot, which is similar to a rice pancake. On the latest menu, he offers a sheermal-inspired bread and a lamb floss kebab with a gravy of yogurt and cardamom.\nOver at The Bombay Canteen, in Mumbai’s business neighborhood of Lower Parel, Hussain Shahzad has served girda with a Kashmiri-style gucchi or morel preparation.\n“While our tradition needs to be preserved, it also needs to be interpreted for today’s diner. That’s the only way it will evolve,” says Vanika Chaudhury, the chef-founder of the recently-shuttered and critically acclaimed Noon in Mumbai.\nVanika grew up in Kashmir and left home to pursue a career. When she returned years later, to learn more about Kashmir’s bread culture from her neighborhood baker, she was promptly told off. “I told him that I was in town for a week and that I’d come every morning to watch and observe. He scoffed and told me that it would take me a minimum of three years to understand them,” says Chaudhury.\nAt a collaboration with Silo, London, chef Douglas McMaster and Chaudhury curated a one-of-its-kind 10-course menu that featured an instant hit: bakarkhani layered with shavings of a dried local lemon called gondhoraj. It was served with a koji butter.\n“Bread is really sacred in Kashmir and that relationship that a family has with their local kandurwan is really special. Having recently moved back home, she is now spending her time researching local food rituals for an upcoming cookbook. “If we don’t shout from the rooftops about our own food culture, who will?”\n",

Despite accusations of high fees, the New York-based company's researchers claim that \"in the US, the cost of acceptance for American Express is comparable to what eBay pays for similar cards on other networks.\"\nWhile disappointed with the ban, eBay makes up only about 0.2 percent of the company's total network volume. In a statement, Amex said: \"We find eBay's decision to drop American Express as a payment choice for consumers to be inconsistent with their stated desire to increase competition at the point of sale. American Express Card Members can continue to use their Cards with millions of merchants around the world.\"\nRead more: A Beginner's Guide to Chase Credit Cards\nBoth companies have attempted to negotiate the fees without reaching an agreement. Although Amex believes their fees are reasonable, eBay argues otherwise. eBay stated: \"At a time when payment processing costs should be declining because of technological advancements, investments in fraud capabilities, and customer protections by merchants like eBay, credit card transaction fees continue to rise unabated because of a lack of meaningful competition.\"\nIn a statement to Newsweek, Amex said: \"The number of American Express accepting merchants has more than tripled since 2017. eBay canceling acceptance will not change those numbers and, in the US, we continue to maintain 99% parity coverage.\"\nRead more: List of Credit Card Issuers\neBay's spokesperson said to Newsweek: \"Based on research, we know that the vast majority of eBay customers are willing to use alternative payment options to continue enjoying buying and selling on our marketplace. With 2 billion listings and 132 million active buyers worldwide, eBay connects buyers and sellers in 190 markets around the world, fueling small business growth and creating economic opportunity for communities.\"\nAccording to the Merchants Payments Coalition, credit and debit card swipe fees rose to a record $172 billion in 2023.\neBay is not the first company to drop Amex over high processing fees. Retail giant Costco has not accepted American Express cards for nearly a decade, replacing Amex with Visa in 2016. Newsweek contacted Costco for a comment.\neBay faces stiff competition as well. In the first quarter of 2024, the company is experiencing weak revenue and is seemingly losing ground to giants like Walmart and Amazon. The company founded by Jeff Bezos also nearly dropped card issuer Visa over the processing fees in the U.K. In the end, however, the two companies managed to strike a deal.\nAmerican Express remains the most popular card in the US and most large companies accept it as a form of payment.\nAmerican Express also offers its customers use of their online map to search for businesses that accept Amex.\n",

    "content": "Suki Sandhu always insists Manuel Heichlinger “made a beeline” for him that first evening in Berlin.\nWhen Manuel entered the Kaefer restaurant, a rooftop spot on top of Germany’s Reichstag parliament building, Suki noticed him right away.\n“I saw him walk in and I thought, ‘He’s quite hot. He’s quite handsome. That must be someone from the German office,’” says Suki. “But I always ignore the hot guy – I’m like, they probably already get enough attention as it is, just ignore them.”\nSuki genuinely had no intention of speaking with Manuel that night. But the next thing he knew, Manuel had unexpectedly made eye contact with him. Then, more unexpected, Manuel was smiling at Suki.\nAnd then – Suki truly couldn’t believe it – Manuel was crossing the room, walking in his direction. Suki held his breath.\nIt was March 2006. Suki was a 25-year-old consultant at a London based recruitment company. In fact, he was the company’s global top consultant. And the organization had a quarterly incentive where they’d whisk the top performers away for a glitzy weekend in a European city.\n“Whoever was successful from the UK was flown out, put up in a five star hotel and there was a whole programme of fun-filled activities,” recalls Suki.\nOne of the activities was the Reichstag banquet dinner. And a bunch of colleagues from the company’s Berlin office were invited along too, among them Manuel Heichlinger, a 28-year-old recent joiner.\nManuel nearly didn’t go that night. The London colleagues were strangers to him. He was feeling a bit rundown, worried a cold might be incoming. But at the last minute he rallied.\n“I thought, ‘It’s a good opportunity.’ Plus, it was in a really fancy restaurant. I was like, ‘Okay, I’ll just go, it’s a free dinner. Let’s do that. And then I can go home early.’ Basically, that was the plan,” Manuel tells CNN Travel today.\nFor what it’s worth, Manuel “totally denies” making a “beeline” towards Suki.\n“I definitely did not make a beeline for him, I just walked in,” says Manuel.\nBut Manuel admits he did notice Suki right away. And he did end up standing by him during the drinks reception – that’s when they first introduced themselves.\n“I thought, ‘Oh he’s cute,’” recalls Manuel. “And then I did make sure I was sitting next to him at the table, that I agree with.”\n“A beeline,” repeats Suki, knowingly.\nThe restaurant was arranged into several long banquet tables. Suki and Manuel sat together, rubbing shoulders, chatting.\nSuki felt like Manuel was being “super attentive”: he was making lots of eye contact, asking Suki lots of questions. Suki wondered if Manuel was gay – and whether Manuel knew that Suki was gay.\nSuki was out, at least he was out to all his colleagues – and to his large group of London friends. But he’d never been open about his sexuality with his family – in Suki’s large Indian Sikh family, sexuality was never talked about.\nSuki had never known how to broach the topic with his family. And then to develop plans together. We love traveling. We already have that. We want to do things together. And so I think it’s a mix of happiness, excitement and just feeling positive about the future.”\n",

    "content": "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is lashing out after the European Union fined his nation nearly $215 million for violating the EU's asylum and migration laws.\nThe EU's Court of Justice, based in Luxembourg, said in a statement issued Thursday that Hungary must pay a lump sum of 200 million euros and a penalty payment of 1 million euros per day of delay for failure to comply with a judgment derived from \"deliberately avoiding the application of a common EU policy as a whole,\" adding it constitutes \"an unprecedented and extremely serious infringement of EU law.\"\nOrban, a right-wing lawmaker and strong ally of former U.S. President Donald Trump, called the fines \"outrageous and unacceptable\" in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\"It seems that illegal #migrants are more important to the Brussels bureaucrats than their own European citizens,\" Orban said.\nThe court said that starting in December 2020, Orban and Hungary failed to comply with EU rules and procedures.\n\"That failure concerned restricting access to the international protection procedure, unlawfully detaining applicants for international protection in transit zones and failing to observe their right to remain in Hungarian territory pending a final decision on their appeal against the rejection of their application, as well as the removal of illegally staying third-country nationals,\" the court said.\nWhen Hungary purportedly didn't comply with EU protocols, aside from closing transit zones that had closed prior to the present judgment, the court was compelled to impose financial penalties.\nHungary's disregard toward migration and asylum laws was described by the court not just as evading common EU policy and the solidarity by member nations but imposes \"a serious threat to the unity of EU law, which has an extraordinarily serious impact both on private interests, particularly the interests of asylum seekers, and on the public interest.\"\nMore than 380,000 migrants crossed EU borders illegally last year, the most since 2016, according to the BBC.\nIn April, the EU Asylum and Migration Pact was approved—after negotiations dating to 2015—that beginning in two years is designed to speed up the asylum process and return \"irregular migrants\" to their native countries.\nThe 27 EU countries will be required to allocate additional resources to deal with illegal migration and asylum claims or take in the migrants.\nLast Saturday, ahead of EU Parliament elections in Hungary, tens of thousands of Orban protesters galvanized in Budapest in support of Péter Magyar, the leader of Hungary's strongest opposition party, Respect and Freedom (TISZA).\nMagyar has drawn support in opposing Orban, of the Fidesz right-wing party, not seen in well over a decade. He is vying to potentially challenge Orban in the country's next national election in 2026.\n",

    "content": "Alphabet, the parent company of Google, bounced back from an absolutely dreadful day for tech shares, as its stock surged Thursday after the closing bell. All it had to do was to hand out billions of dollars to investors.\nThe tech giant announced its first quarterly cash dividend, saying it will pay $0.20 per share on June 17 to shareholders of record as of June 10, as well as a $70 billion share buyback. Buybacks and dividends help to boost stock prices by rewarding investors with cash just for holding the stock — but they’re widely criticized for artificially inflating the stock price without spending on employees or improvements to the underlying business.\nGoogle’s stock jumped as much as 13% in after-hours trading following the report.\nThe announcement came as part of Google’s earnings report for the first three months of the year, in which it also reported that it exceeded Wall Street analysts’ expectations for both sales and profits.\nRelated article\nMeta’s stock plunges 15% on ‘aggressive’ AI spending plans\nRevenue from the quarter reached more than $80.5 billion, up 15% from the same period in the prior year and ahead of the $78.75 billion analysts had projected, according to FactSet estimates. The company also reported 57% year-over-year growth in profits to nearly $23.7 billion.\nAlphabet chief executive Sundar Pichai attributed the success to the company’s investments in artificial intelligence, including the large language model and suite of AI products it calls Gemini.\n“We are well under way with our Gemini era and there’s great momentum across the company. Our leadership in AI research and infrastructure, and our global product footprint, position us well for the next wave of AI innovation,” Pichai said.\nGoogle’s results were a sign of how investors may reward some tech companies for their investments in artificial intelligence, which many see as the future of the sector.\n“We have clear paths to AI monetization through ads and cloud, as well as subscriptions,” Pichai said on a call with analysts following Thursday’s report.\nBut not every company has successfully convinced investors that they’re investing in AI responsibly. Meta shares sank on Thursday after the company raised its annual expense forecast to fund its AI ambitions, despite better-than-expected earnings results Wednesday.\nBut in addition to Google, multiple positive tech earnings reports on Thursday helped reverse what had been a sluggish day for tech stocks.\nSocial media company Snap, the parent company of social media platform Snapchat, also saw its stock climb after-hours on the heels of a rosy first-quarter earnings report that beat Wall Street’s estimates.\nSnap reported revenue of some $1.19 billion for the first three months of the year, up 21% from the year-ago quarter. And it said daily active users increased 10% year-over-year. The company also offered a better-than-expected outlook for the current quarter.\nSnap has been working to improve its advertising technology and offerings, while undergoing a restructuring aimed at cutting costs. While it nonetheless reported a net loss of $305 million for the March quarter, it was an improvement from its loss a year ago and better than analysts expected.\nSnap shares soared roughly 25% in after-hours trading immediately following the report.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft reported quarterly profits of $21.9 billion, up from $18.3 billion a year ago, signaling that the company’s efforts to double down on AI are also paying off. Revenue grew 17% year-over-year to $61.9 billion.\n“Microsoft Copilot and Copilot stack are orchestrating a new era of AI transformation, driving better business outcomes across every role and industry,” chief executive officer Satya Nadella said in a statement, referring to Microsoft’s AI services.\nMicrosoft shares climbed more than 4% in after-hours trading Thursday.\nWhile rivals play catch up, Jeremy Goldman, a senior director at market research company eMarketer, wrote in an analyst note that it’s clear that Microsoft’s early bets on OpenAI’s ChatGPT are paying off through products like its Copilot for Microsoft365, an AI chat assistant built into its existing suite of business products.\n“Investors should keep an eye on potential AI overspending, but for now, Satya Nadella’s forward-looking strategy is building value by infusing productive intelligence across Microsoft’s entire portfolio, from the cloud to the desktop.”\nMicrosoft’s Azure cloud business also experienced strong growth – revenue grew 31% – boosted by AI tailwinds.\n",

This place has shaped me as a leader, taught me resilience, shown me the value of perspective and how to make hard decisions.”\nMark Thompson, CNN’s chief executive, praised Harlow as a “unique talent who combines formidable reporting and interviewing prowess with a human touch that audiences have always responded to.”\n“She’s been a wonderful colleague at CNN, and we know she will have much success in her future endeavors,” Thompson said.\nAmy Entelis, executive vice president of talent and content, also praised Harlow in a statement, saying she “leaves CNN after more than 16 memorable years, thousands of hours in the anchor chair and hundreds of reports from the field.”\n“Poppy is a brilliant journalist who sets the standard for reporting with compassion and humanity, and we will miss her,” Entelis said.\nHarlow joined CNN in 2008 and worked in a variety of roles at the network. During her time, she reported across the world on some of the biggest and most consequential news stories, including the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings and 2015 Paris terror attacks.\nHarlow, who has a background in business journalism, hosted the “Boss Files” podcast and also regularly landed notable executives for interviews, including Warren Buffet, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill and Melinda Gates, Susan Wojcicki, Jamie Dimon and others.\nIn 2022, then-CNN chief Chris Licht tapped Harlow to help relaunch the network’s flagship morning show. Harlow became co-host with Kaitlan Collins and Don Lemon. The show, however, struggled to capture an audience and behind-the-scenes drama fueled tabloid headlines. Lemon was ultimately dismissed from the network and Collins was moved to helm a solo prime time show.\nThompson, after taking over from Licht, announced in February that he would reconfigure CNN’s morning lineup. “CNN This Morning” changed time slots and moved to Washington, D.C., where it is now hosted by Kasie Hunt.\nThe new morning show lineup left Harlow without an anchor slot. CNN engaged in discussions with Harlow, but ultimately she decided to exit the network.\nIn her email to colleagues, Harlow said that in the immediate future she looks forward to spending more time with family.\n“For now, my plan is to walk our children to school and pick them up (hopefully they won’t get sick of me!), and to support the evolution of journalism in every way I can, while preserving the human(ity) in it,” Harlow wrote. “I’m excited for what is ahead – and I will be rooting for CNN always.”\n",

    "publishedAt": "11:32 AM EDT, Wed April 24, 2024",
    "content": "He came, he saw, he jabbed and then his life outside of the ring appeared to unravel.\nRyan Garcia was seen as poster boy for boxing, training alongside the likes of Canelo Álvarez and Óscar Valdez. The boxer would also frequently reference the importance of his religious faith.\n“Thank you, the Lord Jesus Christ. The King of Kings, Lord of Lords, thank you,” Garcia said at a pre-fight media conference.\nThen in January 2024, Garcia and his wife Andrea Celina, who have two children, announced their divorce.\nGarcia has a big smile on his face. He does a little dance and shakes his shoulders in a relaxed manner.\nHis joyous, carefree attitude belies what’s at stake. Garcia is within seconds of beating undefeated WBC super lightweight champion Haney in a performance which has got the boxing world talking – and then some.\nAhead of the fight, Garcia missed the weight limit for the bout, which ended his chances of competing for a world title on April 20. To miss the weight limit for a world title fight isn’t unheard of, but it’s rare.\nNonetheless, the 25-year-old Garcia knocked down Haney three times in a majority decision victory last Saturday in front of a sold-out crowd at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York.\nIt’s a result which not only reestablishes Garcia atop the boxing food chain, but also caps off a surreal week in his life.\n“I don’t give a f**k what people say about me,” Garcia said after the fight. “I walked through the fire and still held it down and still beat f**king Devin Haney and still drink every day.”\n“Not necessarily proud of that, but I’m just saying it was a statement to show you, you guys can’t really f**k with me.”\nFrom Muhammad Ali and Mike Tyson to Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder, boxing has had plenty of maverick fighters.\nHowever, the behavior of Garcia, who had previously had the reputation of a clean-cut boxing talent with the world at his feet, was so erratic on social media in the weeks preceding Saturday’s bout that some people thought the 25-year-old shouldn’t have been allowed to fight Haney.\n“In the ring, I’m gonna beat your a**,” Garcia posted on Instagram ahead of the fight. “You thought I wasn’t gonna make it to the fight. I bet you hoped I would’ve got pulled out. I bet you hoped it was some kind of mental health issues.”\nMany speculated that Ryan was going through a mental health crisis, including boxing promoter Eddie Hearn.\n“It’s like the Truman Show, watching Ryan Garcia implode,” Hearn said in an interview with Boxing Social.\nGarcia hasn’t shied away from talking about his struggles with mental health. After a knockout win over Luke Campbell in 2021, he stepped away from the sport of boxing to deal with his psychological struggles.\n“I had no choice. It was so intense. Usually, I can get past things because I’m mentally strong,” Garcia told The Breakfast Club.\n“This one was different. It was like nope, you’re not getting up today. It was everything. I thought I was losing my mind.”\nGarcia returned to the sport in April 2022 to secure a unanimous decision win over Emmanuel Tagoe in San Antonio, Texas.\nFast forward to April 2024 and Garcia ramps up the braggadocio levels ahead of his fight with Haney, taking to Instagram to say he’s been cleared to fight after a mandatory drug test and mental health evaluation.\n“I proved to everybody that I don’t do drugs. I’m perfect,” Garcia said in a video. “I’m perfectly fine. I’ve been evaluated. I had a meeting with the state commission. I don’t understand why people continue to judge me so hard. I’m just having fun.”\nCNN asked the New York State Athletic Commission for details as to how it evaluated Garcia’s fitness to fight.\n“The commission works to protect the health and safety of all participants in combative sports, and to preserve the integrity of combative sport competition in New York State,” said the Commission in a statement.\n“The Commission has broad authority to assess the medical fitness of professional athletes (mental and physical health included), and engages in a thorough case-by-case diligence process with every professional athlete based on their personal medical history and circumstances prior to their participation in competition.\n“No match is held until the professional athletes are found medically fit for competition. The Commission will not comment on the specific medical testing and evaluations of any particular person.”\nCNN has also reached out to Garcia’s representatives to offer the boxer the opportunity to comment.\nHowever, at the weigh-in, Garcia takes to the stage and chugs what appeared to be a beer. He later told Youtuber and fighter Jake Paul in a recorded call that it was apple juice and sparkling water.\nThe weight for the fight had been set at 140 pounds, but, to the surprise of many, Garcia came in at just over 143 pounds.\nOne who wasn’t surprised was Haney, who throughout the pre-fight press conference, predicted Garcia would miss weight.\nDuring the press conference for the fight, Haney asked Garcia to pay him $500,000 per pound if he missed weight. Haney later said that Garcia honored the agreement by paying him the $1.5 million.\nAccording to sources who spoke to ESPN, Garcia forfeited upward of $600,000 of his purse to step into the ring with Haney.\nAs a result, Garcia’s shot at winning the WBC super lightweight was lost but he still fought Haney, despite coming into the bout as a huge underdog.\nIn the first round, Garcia pounced on Haney with constant pressure. Haney felt his power when he connected flush with a left hook. In the second, third and fourth rounds, Haney made adjustments and won by utilizing his jab.\nBut Garcia’s speed and power proved to be too much as the fight entered the later rounds. For the first time in Haney’s professional career, Garcia was able to knock him to the canvas in the seventh, 10th and 11th rounds.\nIn the end, Garcia’s hand was raised, winning by the judges’ scores of 115-109, 114-110 and 112-112.\nAlthough he missed a shot at claiming a championship belt, Garcia exited Saturday’s fight with his reputation greatly enhanced after handing Haney his first professional defeat.\nAnd if Garcia’s reputation as one of the most exciting boxing talents took a hit last year when he suffered his first professional defeat to Gervonta Davis, Saturday’s victory is a giant step in rebuilding his boxing pedigree.\n“Come on, guys, you really thought I was crazy? You all lost your own minds.” Garcia said in his post-fight interview. “You guys overegg everything.”\nGarcia and Haney fought six times in the amateurs, each winning three fights. After Saturday night’s fight, both boxers agreed to a rematch.\n",

    "content": "If you took an American Airlines flight in the 1960s, you’d be wined and dined from the Coach-class  “Royal Coachman” menu. Your meal began with the beef consommé and proceeded to sautéed breast of chicken in wine. Care for a fruit tartlet for dessert?\nToday, if you’re flying coach, you’ll need to book a long-distance international flight or – maybe if you’re lucky – a coast-to-coast domestic one to receive a free meal. On shorter flights, you might get a choice of complementary Biscoff cookies or pretzels.\nAirplane food has fallen a long way from the glory days of in-flight dining when meals were served on white tablecloths and stewardesses scrambled eggs in the air. Disappearing meals have joined a long list of pain points, inconveniences and cutbacks that fliers endure today. But industry cost-cutting isn’t the only reason your tartlet is gone. The end of in-flight dining for many passengers surprisingly rose out of big changes in government regulation, airplane design, in-flight movies, industry tax breaks, plus heightened health and safety concerns.\nAirline safety protocols and regulations since September 11 have changed what types of cooking knives crews can work with in the air. Airplane galleys are smaller to allow for more passenger seats on a plane. And airlines don’t serve some foods, like peanuts, to protect people with allergies. Meals are often smaller, blander or non-existent.\n“Meal service was once a point of pride,” said Henry Harteveldt, who covers the travel industry for Atmosphere Research Group. Now, “the quality is so poor you have to wonder: Do airline executives actually have taste buds?”\nAirlines have long looked for ways to cut food production costs and reduce meal preparation times for flight attendants on board. In one famous example during the 1980s, Robert Crandall, then the head of American Airlines, bragged about how removing just one olive from every salad saved the airline $40,000 a year.\nCost and speed became more important to airlines than how the food tastes ever since. Carriers like Singapore Airlines or Delta may have partnerships with Michelin-starred celebrity chefs, but most companies farm out their food to catering services who may prepare it hours ahead.\n“People are willing to trade food for low fares,” said Blaise Waguespack, a professor of airline marketing at Embry‑Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida. “Your ticket gets you the seat. And anything beyond the seat you pay for.”\nCharging passengers for food on board – even just a few dollars for a sandwich, snack box or cheese plate - is also a way for airlines to save on taxes. Domestic airfares are subject to a 7.5% federal excise tax, but that tax doesn’t apply to baggage fees and on-board food, both of which are getting more expensive.\nFood on planes has been around almost a century, ever since 1920s flight attendants handed out chewing gum to passengers to relieve pressure in their ears. Early airplanes bounced so much in flight that meals were served on paper plates, according to the Smithsonian.\nFor decades, the federal government regulated airfare and routes, so airlines tried to set themselves apart with service, food and the kind of luxury usually afforded cruise passengers – or a Bond villain.\nUntil 1978, when the airline industry was deregulated, the law required that every passenger got an entrée, two vegetables, a salad, dessert and a drink as part of their ticket price, according to the Smithsonian.\n“Delicious food adds to the enjoyment. It’s prepared in four simultaneously operating galleys, where dishes can be cooked in five-minute ovens,” Pan Am advertised in a 1958 commercial.\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, airlines routinely installed sky-high kitchens on board and advertised their menus to draw customers. Beef was a business strategy.\n”Airlines competed on service and amenities. Meal service was a big focus of [competition] because entertainment options were more limited,” Harteveldt said. “Airlines would have teams of chefs, their own catering kitchens [and] advertising around food.”\nAs deregulation took hold, airlines cut ticket prices. But to make up for lost revenue, they cut back on food choices and other services as well.\nThe September 11 attacks accelerated the decline of free airline meals. Airlines faced a deep reduction in demand and slashed in-flight meal service in response. United, American Airlines, Delta and others announced sharp reductions in-flight meal service shortly after the attacks.\nThe last holdout, Continental Airlines, became the final major airline to end free domestic meals in economy class in 2010.\nAirline meals had been the brunt of jokes and criticism for decades, but now people miss them. Few airline-industry experts see them coming back anytime soon in coach.\nThe reality is very different for business and first-class passengers.\nMolly Brandt, the executive chef of culinary innovation for North America at in-flight catering company Gategroup, said that the “golden age for airline food is here.” It just depends on which airline you’re flying and category you’re in. “It’s broken down by cabin class,” she explained.\nIf you’re in first class on an American flight, for example, you may have a lunch choice of a Mediterranean bowl, chicken breast with mojo sauce, Poblano black bean rice and plantains or penne pasta with plant-based ragu and ricotta. For Delta, pick between the cheeseburger, the spinach and cheese agnolotti, or a Hempler’s smoked peppered chicken breast salad.\nA handful of airlines even offer caviar to first class passengers. But most fliers these days don’t even get the free chewing gum.\n",

The views expressed here are solely hers. Read more opinion on CNN.\nFriday’s midnight release of “The Tortured Poets Department,” Taylor Swift’s 11th album, means that yet another era has begun — and a record-breaking one at that. Swifties, who are now more than familiar with football jargon (at least when it comes to Kansas City Chiefs’ tight end Travis Kelce, Taylor’s beau) can finally put away the grill and the drinks, lock the car, and leave the parking lot for the stadium. The tailgate is over: it’s game on for Taylor Nation.\nI am one of them, and the anticipation — along with the revelry — has been an extended family affair.\nHaving secured tickets to an epic night of the Eras tour last spring at Gillette Stadium, my daughter Hannah and I made a pilgrimage from New York to attend the show with my lifelong best friend Sarah and her daughter Maggie. We were two moms with decades of concerts — from Def Leppard to U2 to Lizzo — under our belts, and our teen daughters, with whom we have danced to the likes of Harry Styles, Olivia Rodrigo and SZA.\nThe thing is, after that night at Gillette, I thought we were on the other side of Swift mania for a while. I was wrong. When more dates were announced, Maggie somehow got a code and purchased four seats for us in … are you ready for it?\nVancouver. A mere 2,500 miles away.\nThe seats are terrible, Sarah told me. It would be ridiculous to do this, we reasoned. I was very close to getting Hannah to agree it was too much. But Maggie was not to be dissuaded — and Sarah and I realized this might be the last great thing we do before these girls of ours leave our houses and head to college, to jobs and to lives that will be even more of their own than they are now.\nWe are not alone in this. The broader Swiftie community serves as a connector for all kinds of relationships, from best friends to parents and kids, creating a landscape for communication, bonding and the rites of passage that can be so difficult, perhaps especially for teenage girls like our daughters.\nAn absurdly brief trip to Vancouver via — literally — planes, trains, and an automobile was set. All things Swiftie, then, were settled. Or so we thought, until February.\nRelated article\nOpinion: A concert mom’s take on Taylor Swift and Ticketmaster\nThat’s when Swift, at the Grammys no less (where she won a historic fourth Album of the Year award for “Midnights”), announced “The Tortured Poets Department” would be coming on April 19. In the days leading up to the big night, Swifties speculated that the artist would reveal the long-awaited re-release of “Reputation,” her sixth album, which many felt would be the next “Taylor’s Version,” a series of re-recordings that allowed her to regain rights to her material after Big Machine, her original record company, sold her masters.\nSwifties dug into Taylor math, which often revolves around the number 13, the date of her December birthday. Indeed, 13 days before the Grammys, her friends, including Kelce, had changed their profile pictures on social media to black and white, the colors of “Reputation.” She showed up on the Grammys’ red carpet in a white dress with black accents. Her website went down, replaced by a black screen and seemingly meaningless words in white, including “Error 321” and “DPT:321” and “hneriergrd,” which Swifties unscrambled as “red herring.”\nThe speculation was overwhelming: A fax error? A countdown? A blind alley? No. It was the new album. With a smile and what looked like a peace sign, she left the stage, the album’s cover immediately going up on her Instagram site.\nThe pregame anticipation on this one has been intense, starting with how and when she recorded this, her fourth album in four years, while prepping and executing the highest-grossing concert tour of all time. Her work ethic makes the rest of us mere mortals feel inadequate at best. She writes, like Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Alexander Hamilton, as if she is running out of time.\nBut the bigger question was what — who — this record was about, and all paths led to the 2023 end of her six-year relationship with British actor Joe Alwyn.\nRelated article\nTaylor Swift’s surprise double album ‘The Tortured Poets Department’ is daggers wrapped in a lullaby\nThe easiest clue, of course, is the title itself, a seemingly savage take on Alwyn’s WhatsApp chat with his friends entitled “The Tortured Man Club.” The release date, too, holds value. While fans locate Swift’s split from Alwyn to be anywhere from February to early April, 2023, it was on April 19 that she went to dinner with friends Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, who subsequently unfollowed Alwyn on social media. The date also, of course, marks the anniversary of the split of the 13 American colonies (13, don’t forget) from Great Britain in 1775 with the Battle of Lexington and Concord, starting a war against a perceived tyranny that would end in independence for the oppressed.\nAn album about liberation? Freedom? Separation? A break from … a British boyfriend? A date chosen because 256 days remain in the year, and if you add those numbers up you get 13?\nWhen the track list emerged, all eyes went to track five, which is where Swift has always located her heart, producing gut-wrenching tracks such as “Dear John” on “Speak Now,” “My Tears Ricochet” on “Folklore” and the epic “All Too Well” on “Red,” which allegedly details in excruciating detail her breakup with actor Jake Gyllenhaal.\nThis time around, we have “So Long, London,” cowritten with The National’s Aaron Dessner, whose last track five with Swift was on “Evermore,” the devastating “Tolerate It.”\nSo, what has my cohort of Swifties made of all this? My best friend’s daughter, the teen I thought might be done with all this for a while (as we wait for Vancouver), might actually be the Swiftie of all Swifties, a Taylor archivist of sorts (with a brother who was born on … December 13). Where does all of this fit, I asked her — what’s the long game?\nRelated article\nWhy young people are throwing PowerPoint parties\nIn true Gen Z fashion, she responded a few hours later with an extensive, masterful, complex slide deck presentation that would undoubtedly nab her an A in Harvard’s Taylor course. She contextualized the theories — some rational, some out there, but all relevant because in Swiftie world, nothing is coincidence and everything is intentional — and concluded that this was, indeed, Swift’s first “break-up” record since “Red” (see Gyllenhaal).\nSuddenly “You’re Losing Me,” a bonus track from “Midnights,” which is about the things that keep you up at night, seemed like a precursor, a song about the beginning of an end, especially when longtime collaborator Jack Antonoff referred to recording the song back in 2021. More clues came when a pale gray and pink “Pop-Up Library” exhibit sponsored by Spotify went up at The Grove in Los Angeles, seemingly a poetry library filled with Swift’s manuscripts.\nIt’s one thing to be a puzzle to your fans — it’s entirely another to make a puzzle for your fans. Swift has created music’s version of “I Spy” novels for this generation, encoding notes in her lyrics, creating everything from complex numerologies to word searches. The relentless hunt for Easter eggs across social media suddenly took physical form in this exhibit: from the 72 (the number of months Swift was with Alwyn) card catalogue drawers, six (the number of years Swift was with Alwyn) of which are open and filled with lace and dead flowers to a bust of the goddess Diana, the original statue crumbled on its way to London in the 6th century because of neglect. “Even statues crumble,” Swift’s TTPD billboard says in New York’s Times Square, “if they’re made to wait.”\nRelated article\nWhy everyone is crying to Taylor’s breakup songs\nWhen it was finally midnight, game time, all members of my own Swiftie family were in our own homes listening to the same thing, track by track, unpacking words and music, texting thoughts and questions (Who is Dylan Thomas? My name is in a song! My name is too!). I went to track five first, which everyone else found to be heresy. But it confirmed an awful lot of what everyone suspected: Swift’s voice at its most vulnerable with the words “And I’m pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free.”\nWas it about Alwyn? Yes. Was it about other things, including (especially?) Matty Healy? Also, yes. Is “The Alchemy” about Kelce? Oh my. Yeah. Maybe. Probably.\nAs we continued to listen — and yes, Friday’s a school/work day but who needs sleep??!! — alongside all of the Swifties posting emotional selfies and TikToks with their hands slapped over their mouths in awe, shouty caps pronouncing their love for this track or that, we found (we thought) answers to many questions, and had new questions that needed answers.\nThis record is as messy as it is emotional. It felt like the initial speculation all those months ago were somewhat vindicated. Perhaps what we thought were peace signs — from Swift’s gesture at the Grammys to a sculpture in The Grove exhibit — were actually twos.\nIn many ways, “Reputation” and “TTPD” felt like two sides of the same relationship, their inverted black and white color schemes creating a yin and a yang, and while the first contains her first love songs to Alwyn — from “Delicate” to “Gorgeous” — the latter creates needed closure, maturity even.\n\nAnd at 2am, with the drop of the rest of what is now an old-fashioned double album, the “two” symbolism took on yet another layer of meaning. Two albums, not one. 31 tracks. And yes, 31 is 13 backwards and that, too, is no accident. Check out the erratic capitalization of track 24, “Thank you Aimee” if you doubt that Swift is masterminding it all. For my merry band of Swifties, there are no accidents. Just puzzles to gleefully solve, together, for as long as we can.\n“Once we have spoken our saddest story, we can be free of it,” Swift wrote on X (formerly Twitter) just after midnight.  “And then all that’s left behind is the tortured poetry.”  For my group of four, what is left to ponder as we continue to digest this record, together, in the coming months is what might be our last concert road trip, our last stab at a mother-daughter journey. Maybe wherever they land, there is a seminar on Taylor Swift.  Then maybe we can study for the final exam together.\n",

Among the key findings, social support emerged as a crucial factor for canine well-being.\nLiving with other dogs, like Harvey and Frankie do, was associated with better health outcomes, highlighting the importance of social interactions in promoting a happy and healthy life for our furry friends.\nThis isn't the first time a dog's reaction to their sibling's antics has gained viral attention. Earlier this year a golden retriever left people in stitches when she was introduced to \"the annoying puppy who won't leave her alone.\"\nIt isn't just dogs that have hilarious sibling moments, either.

    "content": "Retired public relations professional Bonnie Sashin and her husband had just spent a nice Thanksgiving visit and meal with family at her stepson’s suburban home in the Connecticut city of Fairfield, a charming burg of about 61,000 on Long Island Sound.\nBy the time they departed the 2022 family gathering, the sun had already set, Sashin recalls.\nThey cranked up her fairly new Subaru Forester SUV to head to a nearby hotel, where they were staying the night rather than make the two-and-a-half hour drive back to Brookline, Massachusetts, on full stomachs and in full darkness.\n“And just as we turned the corner, practically out of the subdivision where my stepson lives … I can feel something hit the car. You know, it’s dark, and I had no idea what could it be. And I was just very alarmed,” Sashin said.\n“My husband thought it was some kind of animal, and we of course stopped and fortunately a nice, civic-minded woman in front of us stopped. … She got out of the car. She saw me. She was really nice. She said, ‘Oh, that was a deer.’ And she said, ‘It happens all the time around here.’“\nIt turns out that deer-vehicle collisions are far more than a southern Connecticut problem. They’re a problem across much of the United States and in other nations. It also turns out Sashin was fortunate not to have been injured or even killed in the incident.\nEven people who realize how common deer-vehicle collisions are might be surprised at these startling stats for the United States from this November 2022 study in the journal Cell Biology:\n• Around 2.1 million deer-vehicle collisions occur annually.\n• The collisions cause more than $10 billion in economic losses annually.\n• Each year, they account for some 59,000 human injuries and 440 human deaths.\nRelated article\nHow to survive a rattlesnake bite – or better yet, avoid one\nKip Adams, chief conservation officer with the National Deer Association, notes that deer are much more deadly to Americans each year than those scary movie and TV threats – sharks, alligators, bears and venomous snakes – combined. (For instance, there were just two deaths in the United States by shark attack in 2023.)\nLooks like we should be much more wary of Bambi than of Jaws.\nAnd the United States is not alone in having a deer problem. For instance, a 2023 study from Scotland’s nature agency, NatureScot, estimated that 700 people are injured or killed in deer-vehicle collisions in the United Kingdom annually.\nThey grapple with the deer problem in such far-flung places as British Columbia, Japan, Australia and Germany, too.\nSo what can drivers do to protect themselves from unwanted encounters with these herbivores?\nAdams says your best shield against a deer collision isn’t a fancy gadget but knowledge.\n“The first step in helping to minimize hitting one is to be aware of when they are most active,” he told CNN Travel in a phone interview. “Two things that play into that. … One is when they’re most active daily and then also when they are most active annually.”\nAs for the daily factor, sunrise and sunset should be high-alert times for drivers, Adams said. Why is that?\n“Deer are what’s known as crepuscular – crepuscular means most active at dawn and dusk,” Adams said. “The way their eyes are built, they can do the best job avoiding predators and collecting what they need when they move in low-light situations – that being dusk and that being dawn.”\nBut “that’s not our peak vision time. So those two things together – more activity at a time when we can’t see as good – really play into increased deer-vehicle collisions at those times,” Adams said.\nChad Stewart, a deer, elk and moose management specialist with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, concurs.\n“I would say the hour on either side of both sunrise and sunset are the greatest times when a collision can occur,” he said in an email interview with CNN Travel. “This is partly due to deer’s activity around that time, but also because of heavy traffic patterns during those hours.”\nBut collisions can occur anytime around the clock, Adams cautions.\nRelated article\nHow to survive rip currents and other drowning hazards\nCollisions can also happen any time of year – after all, deer don’t hibernate, Adams points out. But two times of year are typically more high risk.\nAdams said the first one is spring. That’s fawning time, and “deer are way more active around roads,” he said.\n“When a doe is having her fawn, the does become extremely territorial of those areas. … What happens is deer get spread out a lot more on the landscape, which means that they’re more apt to, you know, be near a road.”\nBut autumn is the season most fraught with danger, Adams said, “and the majority of that occurs in November. During that time, deer greatly increase their daily movement patterns,” he said, especially the bucks.\nResearch from State Farm insurance company also highlights November as the most likely month of the year to have a collision with an animal.\nAs Bonnie Sashin’s collision in a Connecticut suburb illustrates, you don’t have to be out in wilderness to collide with a deer.\n“Typically, suburban areas can hold higher densities of deer, and with more miles driven by vehicles occurring in these areas compared to rural areas, total number of collisions tends to be highest in these areas,” Stewart cautioned.\n“But with that being said, any place has the potential for a collision.  Especially where habitat transitions occur (e.g. forest to field), which are commonly used locations for deer.”\nAdams said be on extra guard where the woods come out close to the road, where “we have very little opportunity of seeing those deer prior to them being in front of a vehicle.”\nThe suburbs are also a big problem, he said, “because it’s extremely difficult to manage deer populations in those areas. We can’t go in there in most cases and hunt like we do in more rural areas.”\nSome US states have a bigger problem with deer-vehicle collisions than others.\nState Farm compiles annual statistics assessing the risk in each state. While the insurance company’s statistics cover all animal-vehicle collisions, deer account for the majority of them.\nSeventeen states are considered “high risk” for an animal-vehicle collision, according to the latest State Farm report for 2023-24.\nTopping the list is West Virginia, where drivers have a 1 in 38 annual risk of being in an animal-involved claim, State Farm says.\nThat’s not surprising to Adams. The Mountain State is filled with forests, has a high deer population and lacks much in the way of dense urban areas.\n“They have a lot of winding roads through wooded areas which further reduces the visibility. A lot of factors play together there that definitely put West Virginia at the top,” Adams said.\nRounding out the top 5 states are:\nNo. 2: Montana (1 in 53 chance)No. 3: Pennsylvania (1 in 59 chance)No. 4: Michigan (1 in 60 chance)No. 5: Wisconsin (1 in 60 chance)\nYour best bets to avoid colliding with an animal: Nevada, where State Farm says the chance is just 1 in 770, and Hawaii (1 in 710 chance).\nOnce you’re better aware of when and where the collision risk is highest, then it’s time to put driving strategies into place.\n“Basic safe driving principles apply to reduce your chance at a collision.  First and foremost, avoid distracted driving,” Stewart said. Also, slow down in areas known to have high deer numbers so you can “have better reaction should one jump out in front of your vehicle.”\nAdams said use your high beams whenever possible in deer territory – but don’t blind oncoming traffic.\nStewart’s not sold on gadget remedies.\n“Using things like car mounted whistles are not proven to reduce or prevent collisions from occurring, so saving your money and not falling into a false sense of security with these items is advisable.”\nHowever, do make good use of your car horn, advises the National Deer Association in this YouTube video.\nSome other tips from the Michigan State Police:\n• Deer typically follow one another in single file, so if you see one deer, there are likely more nearby.• Look for the reflection of headlights in a deer’s eyes and deer silhouettes on the shoulder of the road.• Scan the roadside while driving, especially around wooded lots, fencerows, field edges and areas near water.\nUnfortunately, some drivers despite all their caution are going to have to make a split-second decision – and fight a natural impulse – when there’s a deer ahead in the road.\n“We have a campaign in Michigan called ‘Don’t veer for deer.’ The reason this phrase is used is because while nobody wants to hit a deer, there can be far worse consequences by swerving to avoid a deer and hitting something else, like a telephone pole or another car,” Stewart said.\n“Sometimes, collisions with deer simply can’t be avoided. But the important thing is to not make it worse for you or somebody else by abruptly and erratically leaving your lane.”\nAdams dispenses the same advice with a fatherly touch.\n“I have a 17-year-old daughter. I talk to her about this all the time. Try to avoid the deer but do not swerve because your chances of having a bad accident are much higher,” he said.\n“It’s way better to hit a deer with the front of your car going straight where that car is built to withstand an impact than it is to swerve and go off the road” and possibly hit a tree or another vehicle, Adams said.\nCollisions account for the vast majority of interactions that result in injuries or deaths to people, Adams said, but they aren’t the only ways people can be hurt by these generally docile grazers.\nThough incidents are very rare, he said deer that have been raised in captivity and have lost their fear of humans can end up hurting the hands that fed them.\nRelated article\nHow to survive a bear attack – or better yet, avoid one altogether\n“You can find accounts where … somebody got attacked by a deer, like literally attacked. In almost every case, that was a captive animal that had been hand reared.”\nSeveral years ago, a Colorado woman was cited for illegally raising a young deer that attacked and gored one of her neighbors, according to state wildlife officials.\nIn 2023, a Florida man’s pet deer was euthanized on the scene by officials after the animal attacked one of his neighbors.\nAlso in 2023, a man on vacation in Greece approached too closely to a deer for a selfie. The deer rammed him and broke some of his ribs.\nThe Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission warns people not to feed deer and to treat them with the respect wild creatures deserve.\nHunting is the other time where human-deer interactions can go wrong.\nIn 2019, an experienced Arkansas hunter was found severely injured in the woods, his body riddled with antler puncture wounds from a deer he had shot but had not killed. He later died. Experts say hunters should wait 15 to 30 minutes before approaching a shot deer to make sure it is dead.\nHowever, the biggest danger in deer hunting is other people, Adams said.\n“Hunting is very safe, and it has gotten way safer over the past couple of decades with hunter safety programs, but accidents still do happen. And it’s very clear that the most dangerous person in the woods to you, if you’re hunting, is the person you walked in the woods with.”\nAgain, awareness is key, Adams said.\n“I have a family camp in northern Pennsylvania. We have a lot of friends and family that hunt that we share our land with. … If we are going out as a group to hunt deer, bear, whatever … I have a little safety talk and tell everybody, ‘Hey, let’s be careful today.’ “\nBonnie Sashin’s Thanksgiving night collision with a deer happened in a flash. But the repercussions took a while to sort out. The Good Samaritan who stopped in front of her was quite helpful, she said.\n“First thing she said to me – which was the best piece of advice for us because no one was hurt – was call the police … because you’re gonna want a record for your insurance company.”\nRelated article\n‘I was up to my waist down a hippo’s throat.’ He survived, and here’s his advice\nSashin said she later learned about a friend who collided with a deer and didn’t call the police right away – and the adjuster gave her a hard time.\nThe front fender of Sashin’s new car was bashed in, but she and her husband were able to drive her SUV back to Massachusetts, where they learned the vehicle could be repaired vs. being totaled.\n“I went in to my body shop where I know the guy, his name is Paul. … He said, ‘Bonnie, get in line. You know how many cars I have that have been hit by deer in the last week?’ ” There were five or six ahead of hers, he told her.\n“The pain in the butt part is that you gotta wait a long time these days with a body shop. … It’s very hard to get parts.” She had to wait until February to get her SUV repaired.\nSashin and her husband continue to drive to family trips in the Northeast, but they try to be off the road before dark these days.\nDespite everything, she’s grateful they weren’t hurt or the vehicle totaled. “I came away lucky.”\n",

He said on Tuesday that doing so could trigger \"a global conflict.\"\nNewsweek has contacted Russia's foreign ministry for comment by email.\nTomczyk said that Poland doesn't have any objections regarding the use of the equipment it provides to Ukraine. \"Ukraine can use [the weapons] as it sees fit,\" he said. \"The Polish position is that there should be no restrictions in this regard. Ukraine should be able to fight with the equipment it receives, because that is why it receives this equipment, to be effective.\n\"Ukraine is being restricted by some countries and this should end.\"\nA number of other Western officials have also backed Ukraine using NATO-supplied weapons to strike military targets on Russian soil.\n\"We support Ukraine and we don't want escalation, that hasn't changed,\" French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters at a joint press briefing with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Germany on Tuesday. \"We think we should allow them to neutralize military sites from which missiles are fired, military sites from which Ukraine is attacked, but we shouldn't allow them to hit other targets in Russia and civilian or other military sites in Russia.\n\"Ukrainian soil is being attacked from bases in Russia. So how do we explain to the Ukrainians that we're going to have to protect these towns ... if we tell them you are not allowed to hit the point from which the missiles are fired?\"\nU.K. Foreign Minister David Cameron has also suggested allowing Ukraine to use British weapons for strikes on Russian soil.\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in an interview with The Economist published on May 25 that members of the military alliance should \"consider whether they should lift some of the restrictions they have imposed on weapons donated to Ukraine.\"\nThe U.S. has maintained that Washington is against Ukraine conducting strikes on Russian soil using Western weapons, including oil refineries, some of which have been fueling Putin's military throughout the conflict.\nCharlie Dietz, a Pentagon spokesman, told Newsweek last week that the U.S. has \"been very clear that we do not support or enable strikes inside Russia.\"\n\"The security assistance we provide them is for use within Ukraine (to include Crimea). And the Ukrainian government understands our position,\" Dietz said. \"For one thing, targeting Russia's oil refineries can negatively impact global security and stability. But ultimately Ukraine is responsible for its own operations, so I'll let them speak for themselves.\"\n",

Since her video was posted on April 11, it has received 1.1 million views, over 111,000 likes and over 840 comments.\n\"There is nothing more superior than having your significant other leave in the morning before you, and you get to stay in bed,\" Napolitano said in the video. \"They're like, 'Bye,' and you just get to stay in bed.

I'm not a morning person, so I just love the few extra hours to lay in bed and relax before getting my day started.\"\nNapolitano said she has a constant appreciation for this set-up, especially since it hasn't always been the case: \"In previous relationships, I was the one getting up first and leaving to go to work, and I hated it,\" she added. \"I was out the door at 6 a.m. and he was in bed until 1 p.m., which made for a very difficult dynamic.\"\nWhen asked what she does on the weekends when nobody is determined to exercise at 5 a.m., Napolitano said she enjoys longer morning rituals with her boyfriend.\n\"My favorite morning rituals with my boyfriend are having coffee together and walking the dog together,\" she said. \"On the weekends, we do this and get a coffee outside with no phones, which I love. We always follow it up with a workout, either Pilates or a run.\"\nViewers in the comments could equally resonate with both the \"stay in bed girlfriend\" and the early-rising partner.\n\"Literally, getting to sprawl out and have the whole bed to yourself again is the best,\" @mackenzie.steen wrote.\n\"I go first and I'm mad about it every single day,\" @alyssasantostefano posted.\nHowever, some are saying life can get even better than Napolitano describes.\n\"Superior is when you have to leave first, but your boyfriend still wakes up with you and packs your lunch, and makes you coffee,\" @legal_marinara commented.\n",

    "content": "The portrait released by Kensington Palace to celebrate the ninth birthday of Princess Charlotte on Thursday, which was taken by Princess Kate, has raised eyebrows online; fans and critics have spotted a link it shares with the Mother's Day portrait that sparked a photo-editing scandal in March.\nThe princess' reworn raspberry cardigan for both images has prompted speculation among social-media users, with some questioning the motivation behind its inclusion. Newsweek approached Kensington Palace in London via email for comment.\nImages released by Kensington Palace have faced increased scrutiny following the Mother's Day scandal. Kate issued a public apology after traces of editing were identified in a portrait of herself and her three children taken by Prince William in Windsor, Berkshire, in England.\nThe photo was of particular importance as it was the first officially released of Kate since stepping out of the public eye to undergo abdominal surgery in January. She then said that at the time of the photo backlash she had been diagnosed with cancer and was undergoing a course of preventive chemotherapy.\nSince photo agencies issued \"kill\" notices to news agencies over the Mother's Day image, William and Kate have moved away from the traditional form of releasing royal celebration portraits to agencies ahead of events. For the birthday of Prince Louis and the couple's 13th wedding anniversary in April, images were released through the Wales' social-media channels. This was followed on May 2 by the birthday portrait of Princess Charlotte.\nIn the image, the princess is shown standing in an outdoor setting, smiling broadly and wearing a raspberry cardigan with denim skirt and blue blouse combination.\nFollowing the image's release, users on X (formerly Twitter) quickly highlighted that the cardigan, identified as being sourced from French fashion brand Cyrillus, was the same one that the princess was seen wearing in the controversial Mother's Day photo.\nThis sparked a wave of posts and speculation, ranging from claims that the image had been taken on the day of the Mother's Day image, despite reports saying it had been created in the days before its release, to fans suggesting Kate was \"trolling\" her critics with the reference.\nIn addition to Charlotte's cardigan, some users also highlighted that Prince Louis appeared to be wearing the same shirt he had done in the Mother's Day photo for his own birthday portrait released a month later.\n\"They must not have gotten any new clothes this year,\" wrote one X user, posting a photo highlighting the matches.\n\"Do these Royal children only own 1 set of clothes?\" posted another. \"Louis in the same shirt as the Mother's Day photo last week. Now, Charlotte in the same cardigan and ruffled neck shirt (albeit a \"different\" color shirt) as the Mother's Day photo. WHY does this keep happening?\"\nIn response, fans of the royal jumped to her defense. \"She is trolling the trolls and I'm here for it,\" wrote on user of Kate in a post with over 70,000 views.\n\"That Mother's Day photo controversy started with Charlotte's cardigan sleeve. Now Catherine is making a point that, this picture isn't altered. She's messing with all the doubting Thomas's [people questioning her] out there,\" wrote another. This is a reference to the fact that one of the editing traces spotted in the Mother's Day image occurred around Charlotte's sleeve.\nFollowing Kate's apology—issued a day after the Mother's Day photo was released, which said \"like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing\"—neither the princess nor Kensington Palace has directly addressed the photo or the scandal surrounding it.\nJames Crawford-Smith is Newsweek's royal reporter, based in London.

    "content": "A New York jury has reached a guilty verdict in the high-profile hush money case against former President Donald Trump, telling the judge they were ready to issue their decision on Thursday afternoon.\nTrump was charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign. The trial, which has garnered national attention, marks a historic moment in the legal troubles facing the former president as he seeks another term in office.\nDonald Trump was found guilty on all charges and now faces potential prison sentence.\nThe charges stem from payments made by Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen, to Daniels in an attempt to silence her allegations of an affair with the former president.\nProsecutors argued that Trump orchestrated the payments and subsequent reimbursements to Cohen, disguising them as legal expenses to protect his 2016 campaign. Trump has maintained his innocence throughout the trial, calling the case a politically motivated \"witch hunt,\" and that not even Mother Teresa couldn't beat the charges against him.\nThe jury deliberated for two days, requesting to review key testimonies and the judge's instructions before reaching their decision. Judge Juan Merchan emphasized the importance of impartiality and instructed jurors to set aside personal biases.\nHe detailed the legal standards for the charges, explaining that the prosecution needed to prove Trump acted with intent to defraud and cover up another crime, such as a violation of election laws​​.\nProsecutors presented a series of documents and testimonies to establish a pattern of deceit. David Pecker, former CEO of American Media Inc., testified about the \"catch-and-kill\" scheme to suppress negative stories about Trump during the campaign. Cohen described his role in facilitating the payments and the efforts to keep them secret.\nThe former president's defense team focused on discrediting Cohen, labeling him as the \"greatest liar of all time,\" and arguing that the payments were personal expenses unrelated to the campaign​​. Trump's lawyers had Cohen admit that he stole money from the Trump Organization and had a personal interest in the case.\nReactions to the trial have been polarized. Trump's supporters, including several prominent Republican figures, have denounced it as unfair and politically motivated.\n\"This is a direct violation of existing case law about jury instructions,\" South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem posted on X, formerly Twitter, echoing sentiments from other conservatives who believe the trial is a sham​​.\nLegal experts and critics of Trump argue that the case demonstrates accountability and the importance of upholding the law, regardless of one's position.\n\"This case underscores that no one is above the law, not even a former president,\" a spokesperson from the New York Attorney General's office said.\nAs the country awaits the official announcement of the verdict, the implications of this trial are profound. A conviction could significantly affect Trump's political future and his ongoing presidential campaign.\nPresident Joe Biden's administration has refrained from commenting directly on the case, but emphasized the importance of respecting the judicial process. However, his campaign took its most public stance yet when campaign officials and supporters made speeches outside the trial on Tuesday.\nIf convicted, Trump could face substantial fines and potentially jail time, though there is skepticism that the former president would actually be sentenced to prison.\nTrump's legal team has already indicated plans to appeal any unfavorable verdict, promising to continue fighting the charges.\n",

    "content": "Melinda French Gates, one of the world’s preeminent philanthropists, said Monday she would resign as co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation that she has helped lead since 2000.\nThe foundation has made nearly $78 billion worth of grant payments in the nearly 25 years since its founding.\nFrench Gates made the decision “after considerable reflection, based on how she wants to spend the next chapter of her philanthropy,” the foundation’s CEO, Mark Suzman, wrote in a statement Monday. “Melinda has new ideas about the role she wants to play in improving the lives of women and families in the U.S. and around the world. And, after a difficult few years watching women’s rights rolled back in the U.S. and around the world, she wants to use this next chapter to focus specifically on altering that trajectory.”\nAs part of her separation agreement from former husband Bill Gates, French Gates said she will receive an additional $12.5 billion for her charitable work.\n“This is not a decision I came to lightly,” she said in a statement posted on X. “I am immensely proud of the foundation that Bill and I built together and of the extraordinary work it is doing to address inequities around the world.”\nFrench Gates said she plans to leave the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation on June 7, and she will share more about her future charitable plans in the near future.\nThe organization will change its name to the Gates Foundation, and Bill Gates will become the sole chair, Suzman said.\n“I am sorry to see Melinda leave, but I am sure she will have a huge impact in her future philanthropic work,” wrote Bill Gates in a separate statement Monday, also posted on X.\n“Looking ahead, I remain fully committed to the Foundation’s work across all our strategies, and to realizing the opportunities we have to continue improving the lives of millions around the world,” he wrote.\nFrench Gates’ exit had been telegraphed for several years. Bill Gates and French Gates announced their divorce in May 2021. They said at the time they would allow themselves a kind of trial period through 2023 to determine if they could continue working with one another to oversee their massive charitable foundation.\nSuzman announced in July 2021 a contingency plan “to ensure the continuity of the foundation’s work.”\n“If after two years either decides they cannot continue to work together as co-chairs, French Gates will resign her position as co-chair and trustee,” Suzman said.\nGates will remain in control and, essentially, buy French Gates out of the foundation, Suzman said at the time. French Gates would receive “personal resources” from Gates for her own philanthropic work — resources that would be “completely separate from the foundation’s endowment.”\nIn January 2022, the foundation announced four new members to its board of trustees to help bolster the foundation’s governance in the wake of the divorce. It marked the first time the Gates foundation added outsiders to the charity’s board in its two-decade history. The charity had no trustees beside Bill and Melinda French Gates since Bill Gates Sr.’s death in 2020 and Warren Buffett’s resignation in June 2021 after 15 years on the board.\n“I want to reassure you that the millions of people our work serves and the thousands of partners we work alongside can continue to count on the foundation,” said Suzman in a post on the foundation’s website Monday afternoon. “The foundation today is stronger than it has ever been.”\n“I know we all wish Melinda the best in her next chapter,” he added, noting that French Gates “will not be bringing any of the foundation’s work with her when she leaves.”\nThe $75.2 billion Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s mission is to improve health care in developing countries, enhance educational opportunities and reduce poverty by providing grants and support to various initiatives and organizations around the world.\nFrench Gates also founded Pivotal Ventures, a separate charity that focuses on removing barriers for minorities and women in the United States, in 2015. She committed $1 billion to the organization in 2019.\nThe Microsoft cofounder and French Gates have both pledged to donate the vast majority of their wealth to the foundation as well as to other philanthropic endeavors.\nIn an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria in January, Gates said he and partners like Buffett have given away about $100 billion into the foundation. With plans to spend $9 billion a year, Gates anticipates he’ll have given away all of his money in about 20 years.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments and context.\nCNN’s Nicole Goodkind, Allison Morrow and Jenn Korn contributed to this report.\n",

But Dubai-based photographer Anish Karingattil is determined to change that.\nOriginally from India, Karingattil moved to Dubai 17 years ago and began photographing wildlife shortly after, specializing in macro photography, using extreme close ups. Highlights of his stunning portfolio of images, taken across the seven Emirates, include a scorpion with her babies, an Arabian horned viper hiding in the desert sand, and two black and yellow mud daubers covered in dew drops.\n“Photographers get to tell a story through images,” Karingattil says. “Macro photography allows me to see life and the world around me in a brand-new way.”\nDespite its hot climate and harsh desert, the UAE is home to over 1,000 plant and animal species. The waters around the country are home to the largest concentration of Indian Ocean humpbacks dolphin in the world, and the second-largest population of dugongs, after Australia.\nWith the UAE’s president recently extending the country’s “Year of Sustainability” into 2024, Karingattil uses wildlife photography as a method of capturing the country’s biodiversity and sharing it with others.\nWhile interior design is his full-time job, “herping” is his passion. “Herping is the act of observing, studying, and photographing reptiles and amphibians in their natural habitats,” says Karingattil. “It is a popular hobby among nature enthusiasts and wildlife photographers who are fascinated by the diversity and beauty of these creatures.”\nBut photographing potentially dangerous animals like snakes and spiders takes a lot of preparation. Before attempting to photograph any wildlife, Karingattil says it is important to research its behavior, habitat and potential risks to understand how to approach it safely and minimize the risk of harm to both the photographer and the animal.\nFor Karingattil, conservation is an important aspect of wildlife photography, which he believes can serve as a powerful tool for advocacy.\n“By documenting the beauty and fragility of the natural world, photographers can help policymakers and the general public understand the value of protecting the environment and the need for sustainable practices,” he says. And with over 69,000 followers on Instagram, Karingattil uses social media to educate people about the species he photographs.\nThe UAE has 49 terrestrial and marine protected areas, including eight in Dubai. Accounting for over 18% of the country’s land territory and 12% of its marine and coastal territory, these protected areas are often natural reserves which include all the major ecosystems found in the region: mountain, desert, coastal and marine.\nAndrew Gardner, associate director of Biodiversity Conservation at Emirates Nature-WWF, says wildlife conservation is recognized as an “important responsibility and obligation by the UAE.” For example, the country is a signatory to multiple international conservation conventions, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity, and has helped reintroduce animals such as the Arabian oryx to the Arabian Peninsula. According to Gardner, there are now over 1,600 oryx in two of the UAE’s protected areas, and thousands more in zoos across the region.\nHowever, rapid development and population growth across the Emirates mean that “53% of bird species, 46.7% of mammal species, 19% of reptile species, and 8% of plant species” are endangered, according to a government report.\nGardner says the Arabian wolf and striped hyena have both gone extinct from the UAE in recent decades, and a small population of Arabian leopards that lived the Hajar Mountains until the mid-1990s are now also believed to be extinct.\nKaringattil points to habitat loss, climate change and overfishing as some of the major threats facing wildlife in the UAE, but one issue he thinks people should take more action against is plastic pollution.\n“Whenever I explore the desert or other areas, I make it a point to clean up the surroundings,” he says. “By removing litter and debris, we can reduce the impact of human activities on the natural world.”\n",

    "content": "Russia abruptly changed its nuclear drill scenario on Wednesday, moving it closer to NATO borders, a day after Moscow and its ally Belarus launched joint drills aimed at training their troops in tactical nuclear weapons.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered the military drills in May in response to what the Kremlin has described as provocative statements and threats from the West.\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said on May 21 that the first stage of the drills had started involving the \"practical testing of the preparation and use of nonstrategic nuclear weapons\" in the country's Southern Military District.\nMoscow's second stage of drills began on Tuesday alongside Belarusian troops.\nIn a statement shared on Telegram on Wednesday, Russia's defense ministry said the country's newly formed Leningrad Military District—stationed close to Finland and the Baltic States—had also joined the nuclear maneuvers. The district was announced in February in response to Finland joining the NATO alliance.\n\"As part of the second stage of the exercises of nonstrategic nuclear forces, personnel of the missile formation of the Leningrad Military District are practicing combat training tasks of obtaining special training ammunition for the Iskander-M operational-tactical missile system, equipping launch vehicles with them and covertly advancing to the designated position area for training for missile launches,\" the ministry announced.\nIt also said the Russian navy would be involved, and that crew members will be equipping \"sea-based cruise missiles with training special warheads\" and entering designated patrol areas.\nNewsweek has approached NATO for comment.\nAfter Putin in February signed new military decrees formally reestablishing the Moscow and Leningrad Military Districts, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a U.S.-based think tank, assessed that the move indicated he is preparing for a potential large-scale war with NATO in the future.\nThe ISW assessed at the time that the re-creation of the Moscow Military District and Leningrad Military District \"supports the parallel objectives of consolidating control over Russian operations in Ukraine in the short-to-medium term and preparing for a potential future large-scale conventional war against NATO in the long term.\"\nThe Leningrad Military District is a key component of the Russian armed forces that oversees parts of the nation's defense strategy in Russia's western region. The district's involvement in Russia's nuclear drills comes amid rising tensions between Russia and the West over Putin's ongoing war in neighboring Ukraine.\nRussia has warned that actions by the West could force it to amend its nuclear doctrine, which lays out the conditions under which it can use such weapons.\nOn June 7, Putin said at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum that his country's nuclear doctrine is \"a living instrument\" that can be changed.\nRussia is \"carefully watching what is happening in the world around us and do not exclude making some changes to this doctrine,\" Putin said.\nDo you have a tip on a world news story that Newsweek should be covering?

    "content": "Having solidified his leadership in what others have called \"sham\" elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin has made bold diplomatic gestures toward Chinese and Iranian leadership while continuing threats of nuclear war against Western opponents.\nWith Russia making recent gains in the war with Ukraine, it appears that Putin has been attempting to solidify his presence and reassert power.\nHowever, the recent arrest of a senior Russian commander who criticized Russia's military and its treatment of soldiers in southern Ukraine has led to suggestions that Putin's influence was weakening and that he may be at risk of being toppled in a coup.\nMajor General Ivan Popov, who had headed Russia's 58th Army, was \"arrested on suspicion of fraud,\" Russian state news agency Tass reported on May 21, citing a law enforcement spokesperson.\nPopov was removed from his command in Ukraine's annexed southern Zaporizhzhia region in July 2023 after he criticized the Russian Defense Ministry for failing to provide sufficient support for the country's fighters.\nPopov condemned what he called a \"lack of counter-battery combat,\" too few resources to scout for artillery and the \"mass deaths\" of Russian soldiers.\nIn a recording published to social media by Russian MP and former military commander Andrei Gurulyov, Popov—appearing to be addressing his troops—said he had \"raised a number of other problems\" to the top of Russia's military command and was dismissed by then-Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu.\n\"The senior chiefs apparently sensed some kind of danger from me,\" Popov said.\nThis, entangled with other rumors, has led to online speculation that Putin is at risk of a military coup. But are any of these claims worth believing?\nPopov's arrest did not happen in a vacuum. Earlier this month, Shoigu was fired while three of his deputies were said to have resigned the previous week.\nOther arrests were made connected to a corruption scandal within the Defense Ministry. The head of personnel at Russia's Defense Ministry, Yuri Kuznetsov, was arrested on suspicion of bribery three weeks ago after more than $1 million in cash and valuables were discovered at his properties.\nAt least five people have been arrested in the scandal, including Deputy Minister Timur Ivanov, who has been in pre-trial detention on bribery charges since April 23 after he was accused of receiving bribes worth $11 million in the form of property services from a construction company in return for contracts. Ivanov denies the charges.\nEarlier this week, it was reported that Vadim Shamarin, deputy chief of the Russian General Staff, had been arrested. Shamarin is reported to be a top aide to Russia's top general, Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov.\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied that the arrests were part of a campaign, telling reporters: \"Of course, there is no talk of any campaigning here. It continues in all departments, be it either federal departments or at the municipal level.\"\nThese arrests, but particularly Popov's, began the speculative conversation. Trent Telenko, a former official at the Pentagon's Defense Contract Management Agency who has studied Russian military logistics, posted on X, formerly Twitter, on May 22 that the arrest of Popov was directly related to the idea of a coup purge.\nTelenko wrote: \"58th Army of the Southern Military District, Ivan Popov, was one of the few competent Russian flag ranks. His removal is about Putin 'Coup proofing' his military.\"\nIgor Sushko, a Ukrainian military blogger and the executive director of the Wind of Change Research Group, has made a number of posts since the alleged \"purge\" began suggesting that the changes in the defense ministry were part of Putin's paranoid strategy.\nPosting on May 24 Sushko said that Popov's arrest and the decision to keep him detained in prison was a sign of a \"COUP RISK RISING IN RUSSIA\" adding elsewhere that there were \"whispers of a rebellion among the soldiers.\"\nOther commentators, such as @generalsvr_en, have posted claims that \"General Staff are preparing to take action to overthrow the current government in #Russia.\"\n\"Allegedly, plans for a \"march on Moscow\" similar to the rebellion of PMC Wagner under the leadership of Yevgeny Prigozhin have been developed,\" they added in a post on May 23.\n\"The speakers assured that according to the conspirators' plan, several columns of military personnel with equipment were to move towards Moscow from several regions, and the implementation of these plans was scheduled for early June.\"\nThe echoes of Prigozhin's attempted \"mutiny\" in 2023 have not faded and such a wide-ranging change of hands and arrests at least begs the question of what discontent lies within the ranks of the Kremlin and the Russian military.\nHowever, judging by what's been said and the credibility of some of the commentators making the claims, the notion of a coup is not particularly strong.\nThe reason for Shoigu's sacking is unknown, but it has been speculated that the appointment of Andrei Belousov, a former deputy prime minister who has no military background, is part of Putin's strategy to improve the efficiency of Russia's war economy as its army seeks to push further into Ukraine.\nThe background to Timur Ivanov's arrest has followed investigation and suspicion since December 2022. The anti-corruption organization FBK, founded by the late Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny, who died in custody in February, alleged that Ivanov and his family lived an opulent life abroad that included luxury cars, jewelry and expensive real estate.\nNavalny's team also said that Ivanov had profited from construction projects in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, which fell under Moscow's control after a monthslong siege.\nIgor Sushko, who has also talked up speculation of a \"coup,\" has argued that none of the \"purges\" have anything to do with Navalny's previous investigations.\nIn a post on May 13, he wrote: \"Reality check: None of the purges at the top of Russia's Defence Ministry are the result of Navalny team's corruption investigations. Corruption is just a public excuse in some instances. Putin was the ultimate and knowing benefactor of all this corruption.\"\nHowever, all of the discussion seems to be, at best, informed speculation. While the change in top brass is piquing interest, no real evidence beyond the announcements of arrests and firings cements the claim that a coup is afoot.\nSome of the commentators who pushed the theory have also shared misleading information in the past. For instance, Newsweek has previously fact-checked claims made by Igor Sushko.\nUser @generalsvr_en, otherwise known as General SVR, has also previously shared baseless and dramatic rumors about Putin having died and being replaced with body doubles.\nNewsweek has contacted a media representative at the Kremlin via email for comment.\n",

    "content": "Michael Cohen issued a statement following the guilty verdict in former President Donald Trump's New York trial on Thursday.\nTrump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, faced trial in New York City on 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment allegedly made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg alleged the payment was meant to prevent her from speaking publicly about her claims of having an affair with the former president.\nOn Thursday, a jury handed down a guilty verdict on all 34 felony counts following the trial, which lasted more than a month throughout April and May, while several states held their primary nominating contests.\n\"This was a disgrace. This was a rigged trial by a conflicted judge who was corrupt,\" Trump said outside the courtroom following the verdict. Trump, who has long denounced the prosecution as a \"witch hunt,\" has said he is innocent of all charges in this case and other criminal and civil cases he is facing.\n\"Today is an important day for accountability and the rule of law. While it has been a difficult journey for me and my family, the truth always matters. I want to thank my attorneys Danya Perry and Joshua Kolb for their invaluable guidance and support throughout this process,\" the former Trump lawyer, who served a key witness for the prosecution in the case, told Newsweek in a text message.\nThroughout the trial, Trump's defense attorneys sought to undermine Cohen's credibility, as he was a key witness for the prosecution. They highlighted previous lies he had admitted to and accused him of perjuring himself in the trial.\nThe charges stem from payments made by Cohen to adult performer Stephanie Clifford, better known by her stage name Stormy Daniels, in an attempt to silence her allegations of an affair with the former president.\nProsecutors argued that Trump orchestrated the payments and subsequent reimbursements to Cohen, disguising them as legal expenses to protect his 2016 campaign. Trump has maintained his innocence throughout the trial, calling the case a politically motivated \"witch hunt,\" and that not even Mother Teresa couldn't beat the charges against him.\nFollowing the verdict on Thursday, Trump posted to his social media platform Truth Social: \"VICTORY ON NOVEMBER 5TH. SAVE AMERICA!!!\"\n\"I'm a very innocent man, and it's okay, I'm fighting for our country. I'm fighting for our Constitution. Our whole country is being rigged right now,\" the former president said in a statement emailed to Newsweek.\n\"This was done by the Biden administration in order to wound or hurt an opponent, a political opponent. And I think it's just a disgrace. And we'll keep fighting. We'll fight till the end, and we'll win because our country has gone to hell.\"\nPresident Joe Biden maintains that he does not get involved with the legal case his Justice Department is pursuing. The Manhattan prosecution was brought at the local level, and not under supervision of the Justice Department.\nMany of Trump's Republican supporters took to social media to slam the prosecution and the verdict.\n\"Radical leftists & Deepstate Operatives have been orchestrating this SHAM trial from the beginning,\" Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, wrote on X. \"What do they do now that President Trump is leading in the polls, and their stunt is failing? You don't see this level of corruption in a banana republic, but it's happening in our own backyard.\"\n\"This verdict is the corrupt result of a corrupt trial, a corrupt judge, and a corrupt DA,\" Representative Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican, wrote on X. \"We will stand with President Trump now more than ever to save the country.\"\nUpdate 05/30/24 6:49 p.m. ET: This article was updated with comment from Donald Trump.\n",

He was not involved in the research.\nThe sample was made up of people with European ancestry so it is limited in the populations to which it can be applied, Shadyab added.\nThe researchers gave each individual a polygenetic risk score, which is a score summarizing the presence of multiple genes found to impact human lifespan, according to the study. The study participants also received a score based on how they adhered to healthy lifestyle tenets, and then were followed for an average of 13 years to see if they had a short, intermediate or long lifespan.\nEveryone, regardless of their genetic risks, were 78% more likely to die early if they had an unhealthy lifestyle, the data showed.\nAnd people with both a genetic risk for a short lifespan and an unhealthy lifestyle were twice as likely to die early as those without genetic risk and healthier lifestyles, said Li, who is also director of National Institute for Data Science in Health and Medicine of Zhejiang University.\nIndividuals with genetic risk could extend their lifespan by up to 5.5 years with a healthy lifestyle, the data showed.\n“Adherence to a healthy lifestyle could substantially attenuate the lifespan reduction for individuals with genetic susceptibility to a shorter lifespan,” Li said.\nThe study was observational, meaning that it could determine associations but could not say for sure that the behaviors were the direct cause of the changes in lifespan.\nBut researchers were able to identify four factors that were associated with the biggest impact on risk of early death.\n“The study identified an optimal lifestyle combination containing four lifestyle factors — no current smoking, regular physical activity, adequate sleep duration, and a healthy diet — that offered better benefits for prolonging human lifespan,” Li said.\nAdequate sleep was defined in the study as seven to eight hours a night. The current Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity and two days of strength training a week for adults.\nModerate drinking in the US is defined as a limit of two drinks in a day for adult men and one drink in a day for adult women, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nBuilding a healthier lifestyle may sound like a major undertaking, but manageable steps can help you get there.\nThere are phone helplines, apps and support groups that can help you quit smoking.\nA CDC funded tobacco cessation hotline, 1-800-QUIT-NOW (784-8669), is free to US residents in all states, plus the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico.\nRelated article\nYou can fight existing signs of dementia with a healthy lifestyle, a new study suggests\nCommitting to alcohol-free days or even challenges such as Dry January or Sober October can help you reassess your relationship with alcohol and reset your habits around it, journalist Rosamund Dean, author of “Mindful Drinking: How Cutting Down Can Change Your Life,” said in a previous CNN article.\nFor a healthier, longer life, many studies have shown support for the Mediterranean diet, a style of eating that focuses on plant-based cooking heavy on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, seeds and olive oil. Red meat is used sparingly.\nWhen it comes to catching enough z’s, if you can’t seem to get those seven or eight hours of sleep, try establishing a sleep routine, getting out of bed when you can’t sleep, and keeping the bedroom cool, dark and free of electronics.\nAnd if you’ve tried and failed to build an exercise routine you can stick to, make it a part of your everyday routine, starting slowly and choosing an activity you enjoy to get your exercise.\n",

    "content": "Having a gas stove in your home is bad for your health, researchers have found, and it could kill thousands of people across the country every year.\nPeople living in homes with a gas or propane stove breathe unhealthy amounts of nitrogen dioxide or NO₂, one of the pollutants from car exhaust, according to a paper in the online journal Science Advances. Long-term exposure to this NO₂ could trigger asthma in hundreds of thousands of people, as well as killing as many as 19,000 people annually.\nThis finding comes as the U.S. Department of Energy announced new energy-efficiency guidelines for gas and electric stoves earlier this year, which has brought a backlash.\nGas stoves work by burning gases, usually natural gas—a mixture of hydrocarbons but mostly methane—or propane. This burning can release byproducts, including harmful gases like carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides like NO₂.\nNO₂ primarily affects the respiratory system. It can cause or worsen respiratory diseases, particularly asthma, leading to symptoms like wheezing, coughing, colds, flu and bronchitis. Prolonged exposure can decrease lung function and increase the risk of respiratory infections.\nThere is also some evidence that NO₂ can exacerbate existing heart conditions, leading to increased hospital admissions and even premature death. Long-term exposure to NO₂ may also affect the development of the lungs in children.\nAround 38 percent of U.S. households have gas stoves, according to the federal Energy Information Administration, although certain states have much higher numbers of gas stoves than others.\nPollutant gases from gas and propane stoves may be responsible for as many as 200,000 current childhood asthma cases, 25 percent of which are due to NO₂ alone, the paper said.\n\"We found that just how much gas you burn in your stove is by far the biggest factor affecting how much you're exposed. And then, after that, do you have an effective range hood—and do you use it?\" said study co-author Yannai Kashtan, a Ph.D. student in Earth system science at Stanford University, in a statement.\nThe researchers also found that long-term exposure to the NO₂ in American households with gas stoves may lead to 40 percent as many deaths as those caused by secondhand smoke, which comes to around 19,000 people each year. This estimate doesn't even factor in the short bursts of NO₂ that are often seen in homes with gas stoves.\n\"I didn't expect to see pollutant concentrations breach health benchmarks in bedrooms within an hour of gas stove use and stay there for hours after the stove is turned off,\" study author Rob Jackson, a professor in Earth system science at Stanford, said in the statement. \"It's the whole family's problem.\"\nUsing a gas or propane stove in the home increases exposure to NO₂ by an estimated 4 parts per billion on average during a year, which is about three-quarters of the way toward the NO₂ exposure level classified as unsafe in outdoor air by the World Health Organization.\n\"That's excluding all outdoor sources combined, so it makes it much more likely you're going to exceed the limit,\" said Kashtan.\nThe paper also reveals that smaller homes are more at risk of these effects, with people in small two-bed apartments being exposed to around twice as much NO₂ as the national average and four times that of people living in homes over 3,000 square feet.\n\"Electric stoves emit no nitrogen dioxide or benzene. If you own a gas or propane stove, you need to reduce pollutant exposures using ventilation,\" Jackson said.\nThe effect of home sizes means that there is a major trend in NO₂ exposure among those with low incomes as well as racial and ethnic groups. The paper found that American Indian and Alaska Native households had a 60 percent higher exposure to NO₂ than average, while Black and Hispanic or Latino households had a 20 percent higher exposure than average. This also is compounded by the fact that these communities may be exposed to higher levels of NO₂ from other sources, including vehicle exhaust.\n\"People in poorer communities can't always afford to change their appliances, or perhaps they rent and can't replace appliances because they don't own them,\" Jackson said. \"People in smaller homes are also breathing more pollution for the same stove use.\"\n",

    "content": "Over the years, I've tried countless diets, including vegan, keto, carnivore, intermittent fasting, and juicing, but nothing worked for me. I felt out of control with my eating habits and constantly gained weight, which affected many aspects of my life.\nLast year, I finally cracked the code. I visualized and lived as the person I wanted to become. I embraced a life of consistency, beauty, and satisfaction, romanticizing everything I did, including the food I ate and the habits I formed. I wasn't just focused on being skinny but on being healthy and happy in my body.\nOne crucial step was to identify habits I could happily live with for the rest of my life. I made it all about things I loved and never deprived myself.\nI began by envisioning my ideal body and identifying who I wanted to become. For me, this meant losing weight, looking thinner, having some muscle, and looking healthy. I wrote down my goals, which helped manifest them into reality. I also hypnotized myself daily, visualizing how I felt in my dream body while eating delicious food.\nThrough this process, I discovered deep-seated beliefs that were sabotaging my weight loss efforts. I realized that my unhealthy dieting habits stemmed from watching my mom struggle with chronic dieting. By understanding these issues, I could reframe my mindset and stop self-sabotaging.\nI also learned to occupy my thoughts with something other than food. Finding new hobbies and interests helped reduce food noise and obsessive thoughts about eating. It was crucial to allow myself to lose weight without thinking of food as the enemy. I stopped depriving myself and embraced portion control. I continued eating foods I loved but in moderation.\nStudying the habits of naturally thin people was eye-opening. I noticed that they ate mindfully, slowly, and in smaller portions. They were also very active. While adopting all their habits was challenging, I focused on what worked for me and stayed strategic about my food choices.\nAccountability was vital. I tracked everything I ate to stay honest with myself. I learned to stop lying about food and face the reality of my eating habits. This helped me understand and address my binge-eating tendencies.\nI adopted an abundance mindset, allowing myself to enjoy my favorite treats daily without feeling deprived. This approach helped curb my cravings and maintain a healthy relationship with food. I also focused on improving my gut health by consuming diverse probiotics and prebiotics, which significantly reduced my junk food cravings.\nPlanning for indulgences, like going to an all-you-can-eat buffet, was essential. I ensured these events were occasional and balanced them with healthier meals. I learned not to put any food on a pedestal and to enjoy my meals fully, focusing on nutrition and satisfaction.\nRegular exercise became a non-negotiable part of my lifestyle. I found workouts I enjoyed, like weight lifting and strength training, and made them a consistent part of my routine. This helped me build muscle, boost my metabolism, and feel strong and empowered.\nFinally, I constantly reminded myself that my new habits made me happier and healthier than my old ones. This mindset shift helped me stay motivated and avoid self-sabotage. I acknowledged my triggers and worked on fixing underlying issues like gut health and regular medical check-ups to ensure no undiagnosed conditions hindered my progress.\nI managed to lose 40 pounds, going from 145 pounds to 105 pounds in a few months.

    "content": "Editor’s Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex’s Perpetual Planet initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.\nMesmerizing photos of ants firing acid, a shrimp floating over a rainbow-colored mosaic sea star, and a butterfly peering in at a wedding party are among the winning images of the Close-up Photographer of the Year 2023 competition.\nThe contest, in its fifth year, celebrates micro and macro photography, striving to show the hidden wonders of the natural world, from microscopic fungi to majestic animals. Micro is the term used for taking photos of tiny subjects that require magnification, while macro involves capturing close-up images of larger subjects.\nTracy Calder, co-founder of the competition and jury member, told CNN how the photos reveal unusual interactions between animals and plants, demonstrating how everything in the natural world is interconnected and interdependent. It “celebrates animals and behavior that people have never seen or encountered before,” she said.\nExtraordinary photos reveal the secret kingdom of the soil\nThis year’s grand prize went to Hungarian photographer Csaba Daróczi, for his black and white image of a Eurasian nuthatch soaring through a forest. Taken with a GoPro from inside a hollowed-out tree stump, the striking image offers a new perspective of the bird against the backdrop of outstretched trees.\nThe title of young close-up photographer of the year went to 17-year-old Spaniard Carlos Pérez Naval for his image of a Moorish gecko on a wall covered with pyrolusite crystals. “These magnesium minerals create stunning formations, which look just like petrified trees, but they are so small that they’re tricky to spot,” he said in a press release.\n“I wanted to capture a gecko in the ‘petrified forest’ for a long time, but they only recently appeared in my village – probably carried in fruit baskets from hotter areas. Due to climate change they can now survive here,” he added.\nThe jury – made up of 23 photographers, scientists and naturalists – chose the winning photos for each category from a total of 12,000 entries from 67 countries. Many were taken in areas local to the photographers, showing the beauty of what can be seen in your own backyard, said Calder.\nClose-up images show insects as you’ve never seen them before\nShe, along with her husband Daniel, founded the competition in 2018. Both are professional photographers. While many other photo awards feature close-up categories, they believed there was a need for an entire competition dedicated to macro and micro photography.\n“It’s often easier for people to get behind conservation stories featuring ‘cute’ or more obvious animals and plants: rhinos, pandas, orchids. But the lesser-known insects and plants we often consider weeds have a huge role to play in keeping everything balanced. Close-up photography often showcases these animals and plants,” she said.\n“There’s also a joy in showing people things they wouldn’t be able to see without a macro lens or microscope. Many of the creatures and plants we show are all around us but are never noticed. The competition is a way for them to be noticed,” she added.\n",

    "content": "A Chinese citizen journalist who has been behind bars for four years over her reporting on the initial Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan is due to be released Monday after serving her sentence, according to supporters and a court verdict.\nZhang Zhan, a former lawyer, was one of the few independent Chinese journalists reporting in Wuhan after the metropolis of 11 million people went into a complete lockdown, offering a rare, unfiltered glimpse into the reality on the ground as Chinese authorities imposed tight censorship on media coverage.\nShe was detained in May 2020 and sentenced months later to four years in prison for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” – a charge commonly used by the Chinese government to target dissidents and human rights activists.\nZhang is due to finish her sentence on Monday, according to the court verdict on her case obtained and published by human rights groups.\nSupporters and rights groups have called on the Chinese government to free Zhang on schedule.\n“So far I have not received any confirmation that Zhang Zhan has left the prison and is home with her family. We are all still waiting,” said Jane Wang, a UK-based advocate for the Free Zhang Zhan campaign.\n“I understand that her parents and brother have been under enormous pressure and warned severely not to give media interviews. Friends’ calls are also left without answers… these are extremely worrying signs,” she added.\nReporters Without Borders (RSF), which awarded Zhang its Press Freedom Award in 2021, called on “the international community to put pressure on the authorities to ensure her unconditional release on Monday,” in a post on social platform X Friday.\nRelated article\nThis Chinese virologist shared crucial Covid-19 data. Then his research hit hurdles\nIn early February 2020, just days after Wuhan went into lockdown, Zhang traveled some 400 miles from Shanghai to the central Chinese city to report on the spread of the virus and subsequent attempts to contain it, just as authorities tightened censorship on state-run and private Chinese media.\nFor more than three months, she documented snippets of life under lockdown in Wuhan and the harsh reality faced by its residents, from overflowing hospitals to empty shops, as the world braced for the spread of the virus. She posted her observations, photos and videos on WeChat, Twitter and YouTube – the latter two of which are blocked in China.\n“I can’t find anything to say because everything is covered up. This is the problem this country is facing now: any opposing opinions from us might be (dismissed as) ‘rumors,’” she said in a video two weeks after arriving in Wuhan, donning a face mask.\n“Even our own voices are out of our control. They imprison us in the name of pandemic prevention and restrict our freedom…If we cannot obtain the truth, if we cannot break their monopoly of the truth, the world will be meaningless to us.”\nHer posts came to an abrupt stop in mid-May, and she was later revealed to have been detained by police and brought back to Shanghai.\nChina’s Foreign Ministry declined to confirm whether Zhang had been released from prison at a regular news conference on Monday afternoon.\n“I don’t know the relevant information, but what I can tell you is that China is a country governed by the rule of law. Anyone who violates the law should be punished by law,” said ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin.\n“At the same time, China fully protects the legal rights of defendants and prisoners in accordance with the law,” he added.\nHuman rights advocates who have long worked on China say Zhang is likely to live under close surveillance from authorities even if she does walk out of prison.\n“While Zhang is released from prison, it won’t mean she will be free,” said Yaqiu Wang, research director for China at advocacy group Freedom House.\n“If the Chinese government’s past record is of any indication, she will face continued harassment and surveillance by authorities. But if Zhang Zhan’s past actions are any indication, she will keep fighting against efforts to silence her.”\nSarah Brooks, Amnesty International’s China director, said she was concerned that Zhang’s ability to travel or to make contact with relatives and others, especially those outside China, may be severely restricted.\n“Zhang Zhan should never have been jailed in the first place; now, having served her time, our hopes are with her and her family for a safe reunion and road back to health and, if she chooses, her important human rights work,” she said.\n“The Chinese government’s jailing of Zhang Zhan has been a shameful assault on her human rights, and her release must mark a new beginning.”\nSupporters and rights groups are also concerned about Zhang’s access to medical treatment upon her release, given her poor health conditions while in prison.\nThe 40-year-old has been on multiple hunger strikes since being detained and was briefly hospitalized. In 2021, Zhang’s mother said her daughter was so frail that she could not hold her head up for lack of strength and was in desperate need of medical care.\nDuring a previous hunger strike, Amnesty International alleged Zhang was shackled and force fed, treatment the group said amounted to torture.\nChina’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not previously respond to CNN on allegations of Zhang’s mistreatment in detention.\nIn a lengthy statement issued in July 2020, the Foreign Ministry denied the Chinese government had cracked down on journalists who “exercised their right to freedom of speech on the Internet” during the pandemic.\n“In China, no one gets punished or penalized simply because of making remarks,” the statement said. “The Chinese government has all along conducted its Covid-19 response in an open and transparent manner, and has made widely recognized achievements.”\nZhang was one of a number of independent reporters who were detained or disappeared during the outset of the pandemic, as Chinese authorities clamped down on coverage of the virus and propaganda outlets went into overdrive portraying Beijing’s response as effective and timely.\nChina is the biggest jailer of journalists in the world, according to Reporters Without Borders, which ranks it at 172 out of 180 countries around the world in its annual Press Freedom Index.\nAuthorities tightly control the press at home while blocking most foreign media outlets via the Great Firewall, its vast online censorship and surveillance apparatus.\n",

    "content": "When President Joe Biden visited Virginia to commemorate Earth Day on Monday, he was joined by Sen. Bernie Sanders, a key architect of the clean energy proposals that Biden was rolling out. But those weren’t the only items on the Vermont independent’s mind.\nSanders, according to people familiar with the conversation, used the rare private time with Biden – a longtime Senate colleague who was once his rival in the Democratic presidential primary – to relay concerns about the administration’s handling of the humanitarian situation in Gaza and to urge Biden to use newly authorized funding as leverage over Israel.\n“The main message was: ‘You’re going to have it in your pocket … you need to hold it and condition this funding,” Faiz Shakir, a longtime adviser to Sanders and executive director of More Perfect Union, told CNN. The money “cannot come in and just go right out.”\nThe demands from the progressive flank of the president’s own party come as protests over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza grow in number and intensity, most notably on college campuses, where protesters have decried the stance of “Genocide Joe.” But where the domestic politics of the situation are concerned, the president and his administration remain unbowed.\nThis week’s rapid spread of college campus encampments meant to protest the war has ratcheted up the pressure on the US over its support for Israel. The temperature has been raised on campuses across the country as the protests are met with concern about antisemitic comments that Jewish students have heard at some of the protests and clashes between protesters and police officers sent to break up the encampments.\nColumbia University, the epicenter of the campus protests, has transitioned classes into hybrid mode until the end of the semester as the unrest reaches a fever pitch. Second gentleman Doug Emhoff spoke by phone with two Jewish leaders on campus, a White House official said, to discuss the immediate need to address antisemitism on college campuses.\nDespite being just miles from Columbia and the most tense scenes of the protests, Biden will not be making a visit to campus as he holds events in the New York area Friday. Aides never seriously considered a visit by the president to campus, acknowledging the security situation and political calculus presented challenges too steep.\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, the top Republican helping to shepherd the foreign aid package through the House of Representatives, used his visit on Wednesday in part to demand action from the Biden administration in protecting Jewish students. Johnson, speaking publicly during his visit, said he planned to call Biden following his visit and demand action, including a plan for a potential mobilization of the National Guard.\n“We have to bring order to these campuses. We cannot allow this to happen around the country,” Johnson said. “We are better than this.”\nBiden, for months, has taken the pro-Palestinian demonstrations in stride – including at many of his public events – and advisers say there’s no plan to change course. A lifelong politician, Biden understands there will always be some people who disagree with him, and those people have a right to voice their discontent.\nBut one of those advisers acknowledged the explicit threats targeting Jewish students has been particularly alarming.\n“Protest the war all you want,” the adviser told CNN. “What you don’t have the right to do is target Jewish students.”\nSome senior advisers to the president - closely monitoring the growing unrest – are making the case that the protestors comprise a very small percentage of the student body and do not represent the views of the majority.\nRecent polling conducted by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics would seem to support that view. While just 18% of voters aged 18-29 approved of Biden’s handling of the situation in the Middle East, it ranked near the bottom of issues that mattered most to them – with the economy overwhelmingly top of mind. And the young voters polled sympathize in equal numbers with the Israeli and Palestinian people.\nBut the optics of the situation remain challenging for Biden, who this week signed into law an aid package granting $16 billion in additional military funding for Israel as the protests raged on. While the White House has been dissatisfied with how Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is carrying out the war against Hamas and the volume of humanitarian assistance to Gaza thus far, it remains unclear whether that will materially impact what has so far been unwavering support for Israel from Biden.\nIn February, Biden released a national security memo stating that partners receiving military aid from the US must adhere to international humanitarian law. The White House must by May 8 certify whether Israel is complying. While the administration intends to meet that deadline, officials have not reached a conclusion, CNN has learned.\nDuring a phone call earlier this month, Biden told Netanyahu the US could be forced to make changes to free-flowing support if Israel did not make immediate moves to allow more humanitarian assistance into Gaza, CNN has reported.\nIf the US concludes that Israel is impeding aid and not adhering to human rights laws, the White House could pursue a response that slows military provisions, curtails monetary assistance, or drastically ratchets up the public pressure on Netanyahu by the president. No decisions have been made, officials have said.\nAnd while Sanders sought assurances from Biden on how he was approaching the situation, the president remained characteristically diplomatic, Shakir, the Sanders adviser said.\n“The question for a lot of progressives is, is there any accountability?” he asked.\nCNN’s Sam Fossum contributed to this report.\n",

    "content": "Editor’s Note: Aditya Valiathan Pillai is a fellow and coordinator for adaptation and resilience at the Sustainable Futures Collaborative, an independent climate change research organization based in New Delhi. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more CNN Opinion.\nIt’s hard to truly comprehend how difficult and relentless a problem climate change is for a country as large as India. One way would be to rig a drone with a very large battery pack and fly it from one end to the other.\nStart in the south in Bangalore, India’s Silicon Valley, in the fall of 2022. Fly very, very slowly northwards until you reach the Himalayas just before the national elections that started this week.\nYou would witness a country in constant convulsion.\nSoon after take off, you’d see the swish houses and gleaming towers of Bangalore’s new tech and corporate elite submerged amid September 2022’s monsoon rains. Just a little further north and a few months on in March 2023, record breaking fires tear through Karnataka state’s forests, the smoke obscuring vision for days.\nThen, on to the heaving, humid metropolis of Mumbai at summer’s onset in April 2023 to find over a dozen people dead, mostly women, due to heat exposure at a large public gathering. Next, entire stretches of Delhi under water from flooding in July.\nThat same summer, hospitals in the sunburnt state of Uttar Pradesh, home to over 240 million people, fill with listless, heat-stroked workers. Finally, the anticipated visual reprieve of the Himalayan snow caps that never comes — instead replaced by an almost snowless winter that continues into 2024.\nThe impacts of India’s extreme weather are not neatly contained within the country’s borders. This is a global worry. When India introduces wheat export bans due to a heat wave or slows its vaunted IT exports because Bangalore is underwater, the lives of seemingly unconnected millions across the world are affected.\nIndia is the world’s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China and the US. It is also the world’s fastest-growing major economy.\nHow India handles climate change, then, is everyone’s concern. But while climate is mentioned in the election manifestos of the two main parties — the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress — it will, perhaps surprisingly, not feature as a major issue in India’s six-week-long national election that started this week. That’s unlike in Australia, the UK and US, among others, where elections can be significantly influenced by climate policy positions.\nThis is because climate politics looks different in the developing world; it will shape Indian elections in definitive but under-the-radar ways. Climate impacts do shape voter demands — though this tends to filter through as anxieties about livelihood and continued welfare support, rather than in a neatly defined area of politics labeled “climate.”\nYou can see it in farmers asking for loan waivers and irrigation facilities after years of drought, in urban families demanding reduced electricity prices to offset cooling bills and in calls for more penetrating social welfare.\nHere in the world’s most-populous country, the average Indian does not emit very much at present. India’s relatively low per-capita carbon emissions of 1.9 tons per person are less than half of the global average of 4.7 tons per person — and several times lower than developed economies.\nThis duality — low per-capita emissions and a rapidly growing economy — also shapes India’s climate policy. The incumbent government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has both pushed the rapid deployment of renewables and domestic green manufacturing to create jobs, while continuing to rely on fossil fuels to power the economy. That’s fairly similar to previous governments.\nLeaf through the BJP and Congress’ election manifestos and you will find several dozen pledges across sectors that could be filed under climate policy, with a roughly even split between the two parties (though their emphases predictably differ).\nStump speeches throughout this campaign season have not featured climate change as a central issue.\nAditya Valiathan Pillai\nBut these are listed across several chapters and rarely mention the word “climate” (though each has a separate chapter on sustainable development). Similarly, stump speeches throughout this campaign season have not featured climate change as a central issue.\nParties do however focus on climate-adjacent developmental issues — including expanding entitlements for the poorest (which could also help with weather shocks), creating jobs through green manufacturing and reconfiguring Indian agriculture.\nBut politics here seems to reflect the relative insignificance of climate change as a conceptual category in the Indian voter’s mind. When tens of thousands of farmers marched through Maharashtra in 2018 after several years of drought across parts of the state, they protested against rising agricultural debt, declining productivity, pests and inadequate irrigation. This was a climate protest in all but slogan.\nTake for example a Muslim woman I spoke with a few years ago from the poorer reaches of North Bengal. Her small house in an informal settlement in Delhi was engulfed in a summer fire, and then a few years later her family home in Bengal was damaged in a monsoon flood.\nShe supports a large family of children and grandchildren as a house cleaner in Delhi’s rich neighbourhoods. Despite the fingerprint of climate impacts on her past, her main demands in previous elections were for regular water (which she gets once in two weeks from a water truck), cheaper electricity (she told me she pays around three times the price her rich employers pay because of an illegal connection), and cheaper health care.\nRelated article\nNarendra Modi: India’s popular but controversial leader seeking a transformative third term\nElections turn, then, on meeting developmental exigency. The headwinds of climate change are absorbed by the electoral machine and emerge as end-of-tailpipe policies rather than grand climate strategy.\nThis pattern of climate politics is reinforced by seemingly low recognition in India of climate change as a problem. In a 2022 survey of over 4,500 individuals across the country, over 50% of respondents said they knew little or nothing about climate change. Interestingly, recognition of climate change increased to over 80% in that survey when respondents were supplied with a short description of the phenomenon.\nThe hotch-potch of ad hoc policy fixes that emerges around climate issues will only get the country so far. It fails when put to the long-term test. Mobilizing large amounts of public finance to redesign cities to trap less heat and flood less, for example, requires a genuine public debate about a climate-ravaged future. Immediate investments are necessary to dull the blow tomorrow.\nThe climate crisis also deepens the case for global cooperation. India’s climate-outages are going to be hard for trading partners and global markets to ignore as its economy grows. Domestic politics that focus on immediate developmental goals rather than long-term climate-proofing creates a gaping hole that global adaptation finance must fill.\n\nThis has a moral dimension, too. The climate impacts buffeting India today are largely because of the historical emissions of developed counterparts.\nGlobal resilience must be a priority in an interconnected world. The climate impacts buffeting the most populous nation on earth aren’t just a domestic issue — they’re an international one.\nTamanna Dalal, of the Sustainable Futures Collaborative, assisted the author with research.\n",

To start, the horizon at the back of the image is curved, with a land mass that appears to be floating in the air.\nThe hands and arms of the fishermen are also bent and spread out disproportionately and the boat is asymmetrical.\nWhile it's not referred to as such in the post on X, the creature ostensibly is supposed to be a lobster, but apart from the claws and legs, it looks wildly different from that animal.\nNo other images of this creature or the story could be found online either, despite the fact that such a haul would be likely to invite local news reports or record achievement prizes.\nSo, while at first glance the picture might look somewhat real, close inspection quickly pulls its authenticity apart.\nThere have also been suggestions from other researchers that the image has been misappropriated to help spread disinformation about the effects of the Fukushima disaster.\nIn 2011, an earthquake and tsunami caused the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan to lose power and go into a nuclear meltdown. The plant accumulated around 1.34 million tonnes of water in the decade since, which has been released back into the Pacific Ocean, consistent with international safety standards, since last year.\nChina has reportedly been opposed to the move, saying it would block seafood imports from Japan despite claims that the water is safe. A Fact Check in September 2023 by Taiwanese fact-checkers found that the image of the giant lobster, and other oversized sea creatures, was being shared on Chinese social networks, tied to stories about Japan's discharge of nuclear wastewater.\nThe Ruling\nFalse.\nThis image is not real. There are several tell-tale signs of AI forgery, from a wonky horizon in the distance, to the disproportionate hands and limbs of the fisherman, to the creature's actual appearance.\nFACT CHECK BY Newsweek's Fact Check team\n",

Gavin Newsom to withdraw his backing for a \"limited-term extension\" to the facility, now the only operational nuclear power station in California. However PG&E has insisted the $12 billion figure is inaccurate and the maximum cost will be $8.3 billion.\nRead more: These Credit Cards Earn up to 5% Cash Back on Utilities\nIn September 2022 both chambers of the California Legislature approved a plan to extend Diablo Canyon's license to operate by five years, from an expiry date of 2025 to 2030, with a spokesperson for Newsom telling Newsweek closing the facility would put significant strain on the state's electricity network. However on June 13 the legislature voted to cancel a $400 million loan payment that had been intended to help finance Diablo Canyon's extension, amid concerns over the ballooning cost.\nDiablo Canyon nuclear facility, based in San Luis Obispo County, operates two nuclear units that produce \"18,000 gigawatt-hours of clean and reliable electricity annually\" according to its official website.\nOn May 8 the Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility, which opposes the extension for Diablo Canyon, wrote a letter to the California Public Utilities Commission claiming PG&E's estimate for the cost of extending Diablo Canyon's operation until 2030 had risen from $5.2 billion in May 2023 to $8.1 billion 10 months later, then $11.8 billion in March.\nIn the letter the alliance wrote: \"PG&E's Application seeks approval of the first installment of what it currently 'forecasts' to be an $11.8 billion extended operations period for Diablo Canyon. This is a material increase from the $8.1 billion cost forecast PG&E provided in its July 28 2023 rebuttal testimony...not to mention the recanted $5.2 billion cost estimate in its May 19, 2023 opening testimony.\"\nThe figure was repeated in an article published by the EWG on Thursday, which said: \"Now the public knows the actual price tag (at least what PG&E is currently admitting) is closer to $12 billion. And that figure excludes all of the enormously expensive safety improvements nuclear experts insist are needed for the two nuclear reactors.\"\nHowever, speaking to CBS News a PG&E spokesperson contested the $11.8 billion figure, which they said included costs unrelated to extending Diablo Canyon. Instead they claimed the cost of the extension is pegged at $8.3 billion and that \"the financial benefits exceed the costs.\"\nNewsweek contacted PG&E and Gov. Newsom's office for comment by telephone outside of usual office hours on Thursday. This article will be updated if either decides to comment.\nIn November 2022 Newsom said he supported what his office described as a \"limited-term extension of the Diablo Canyon Power Plant\" after a grant of $1.1 billion from the Department of Energy was announced.\nIn 2018 legislation came into effect requiring California to become completely reliant on clean energy sources, a category that includes nuclear, by 2045. To help achieve this the state has backed plans that would see the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles phased out by 2035.\n",

    "content": "The bad news for Gazprom is flowing as freely as the fuel it once pumped to Europe after it was ordered to pay €13bn ($14bn) for failing to fulfill natural gas orders, delivering the latest blow to Vladimir Putin's major revenue generator.\nThe Russian energy giant is one of the big business losers of Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It posted its first loss in a quarter of a century while facing a stalled pipeline to China as it struggles to find new markets for its products.\nOn Wednesday, German energy company Uniper announced it had terminated its long-term gas supply contracts with Gazprom Export, after an arbitration hearing in which Gazprom was accused of disrupting supplies following Putin's invasion.\nTwo days earlier, Gazprom's annual report had said its natural gas production had been cut from 412.94 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2022 to 359 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2023—a decline of 13 percent.\nIt means that last year's production is nearly a third less than its prewar production of 515 bcm in 2021, with Reuters reporting that this is the lowest since it was set up in 1989 toward the end of the Soviet Union.\nIn May, Gazprom Group, which includes oil and power businesses, posted a net loss of 629 billion rubles ($7 billion) for 2023, its first annual loss since 1999, according to Reuters, marking its fall from the world's largest publicly listed natural gas company.\nBefore the war, Gazprom provided around seven percent share of Russia's federal budget in 2021, but in 2023 it was estimated to be only about half that, dealing a blow to Putin's ability to fund the war and his long-term economic plans.\n\"Gazprom is in a very difficult position,\" said Henning Gloystein, director of energy, climate and resources at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. \"Europe gas sales used to be by far the biggest source of revenue for Gazprom.\"\n\"Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent pipeline supply cuts deprived Gazprom of those sales, and there's no quick and easy way to replace them,\" he told Newsweek.\nTom O'Donnell, a Berlin-based energy analyst, said the problems stem from a miscalculation by Putin who \"had been planning for years before the escalation of the war against Ukraine, to make Europe more dependent on Russian gas.\"\n\"This was effected through a partnership with Berlin who was very trusting of Putin,\" he told Newsweek. \"In the months before Putin launched the actual war, he cut off the gas to Europe. He tried to claim force majeure by making excuses like the compressors could not be repaired because of sanctions.\"\nBut faced with an unreliable trading partner, Europe found alternative long-term gas sources, with Norway overtaking Russia to become its top pipeline gas supplier. Sea- borne liquefied natural gas (LNG) increased from the United States and elsewhere.\nO'Donnell, a fellow at the Wilson Center, said Russia's European market could diminish further when its transit deal signed with Ukraine's Naftogaz in 2019 expires on January 1, 2025. \"Ukraine has been honoring that contract by passing on the gas to Europe, but they will not make another contract. It's clear politically that is beyond the pale for them.\"\nRussia is developing production of LNG, which is transported by ship so offers a route for otherwise stranded pipeline gas. But it probably lacks capacity to build enough ice-capable LNG carriers.\n\"Going into the LNG sector would be expensive and technically challenging,\" said Gloystein. \"Amid the current sanctions environment and a looming oversupply of global LNG, a major entry by Gazprom into this sector doesn't seem viable.\"\nRussia has two main LNG export terminals, Gazprom's Sakhalin-2, on the island in the Far East, and Novatek's Yamal LNG, on the Yamal Peninsula in the Russian Arctic. Gazprom and Novatek also operate medium-size facilities in the Baltic Sea.\nIn January, Novatek suspended some operations at Ust-Luga Baltic Sea fuel export terminal and processing complex, due to a fire started by a reported Ukrainian drone strike.\n\"There's other gas fields up in the Arctic that are planned to be connected to LNG but because of American sanctions, a lot of those projects are slowing down or might be canceled,\" said O'Donnell. \"There are Gazprom fields that are huge, but right now are locked in because all the pipes are mainly connected to Europe and are not being used,\" he added. \"It's not practical to try and connect those north to LNG fields.\"\nAfter much of the lucrative European market disappeared, the Kremlin had hoped the Power of Siberia 2, 2,700-mile pipeline would pipe 50 bcm a year between the Yamal Peninsula in the Arctic to northwest China, offsetting those losses.\nBut prices in the Asian nation are much lower than in Europe, and Beijing is reportedly trying to drive a hard bargain, while a deal over its construction has yet to be reached.\nThe Financial Times reported Beijing only wants a fraction of Siberia 2's planned annual capacity as well as prices close to Russia's subsidized domestic prices. Russia's lack of another overland route for its gas exports means Gazprom would probably have to accept these conditions, the paper said.\nVladimir Milov, former Russian deputy energy minister, told Newsweek that Russia cannot make any profits by exporting pipeline gas to China. Regarding expansion, \"exporting gas from eastern Siberian fields, which are much closer to China, is less expensive than to ship pipeline gas from Western Siberia, which will be even higher costs.\"\nIn 2024, the export price for the Chinese market is $257 per 1,000 cubic meters compared with $320.30 for the European and Turkish markets, according to Bloomberg.\n\"I think probably even $500 per 1,000 cubic meters would not be enough to make sure that Western Siberian exports to China are profitable,\" Milov said.\n\"China is not ready to give that kind of price, which means that effectively the Western Siberian gas is stranded now,\" said Milov. \"They are looking now for secondary markets like Pakistan or Mongolia, but China is clearly not ready to accept higher prices.\"\nThe Financial Times said it had seen a report commissioned by Gazprom leaders which concluded exports to Europe will average 50bn-75bn cubic meters per year by 2035, barely a third of prewar levels. However, it predicted Russia's LNG exports will more than double to 98.8-125.8 bcm in 2035 from 40.8 bcm in 2020 and comprise half total gas exports—increasing the power of Novatek, Russia's largest and most advanced LNG producer.\nGazprom will lose market share to Novatek or be forced to use its LNG infrastructure, according to the report. Western sanctions have cut Russia off from technology such as turbines that help move gas through pipelines and this could impact LNG expansion too.\nMeanwhile, Milov noted how Gazprom has also been trying to set up a \"gas hub\" scheme with Turkey which he describes as a \"gas laundering\" operation in which Russian gas is mixed with Azerbaijani or Iranian gas and resold to Europe via Turkey. But plans have been stalled due to wrangling between Moscow and Ankara over who would control the hub and trading schemes and how the EU might respond.\n\"If that hub ever begins to operate, which I doubt, a tracing mechanism will be introduced,\" he said, which means, \"it is almost certain that restoration of gas supplies to Europe is not going to happen.\" Newsweek contacted Gazprom for comment.\n",

    "content": "In April, the Biden Administration released new Title IX regulations scheduled to take effect in time for the upcoming 2024-2025 school year. Title IX is an over 50-year-old federal civil rights statute responsible for ensuring gender equality within educational settings that receive federal funding. Among other things, Title IX protects students against hostile environments, such as those arising out of campus-based sexual misconduct and anti-LGBTQ bias.\nSince 1974, the U.S. Department of Education has enforced Title IX regulations requiring federally funded educational institutions to provide \"prompt and equitable\" grievance proceedings to address complaints of sex discrimination, including those of sexual harassment and violence. These regulations originally lacked specificity, requiring the Department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) to issue guidance on what an appropriate grievance process should entail at the campus level.\nIn 2011 and 2014, among other things, President Barack Obama issued Title IX guidance requiring schools to specifically address campus sexual assaults rather than deferring these matters solely to law enforcement, and to do so within 60 days whenever possible. However, this guidance-based approach changed in 2017, when the Trump administration rescinded existing Title IX guidance to then amend the Title IX regulations for the first time in 2020.\nAs indicated in the Federal Register's regulatory comments, the Biden administration found Trump-era Title IX regulations were \"overly prescriptive\" regarding certain aspects of campus-based grievance proceedings. The Trump administration had done so intentionally to protect those accused of misconduct over those who were victimized by it. As examples, it heightened standards for issuing interim suspensions and finding sexual harassment charges, while imposing mandatory dismissals for off-campus sexual misconduct incidents and requiring live cross-examination during certain Title IX hearings.\nIt also removed any standard for the promptness requirement to leave schools without any guidance. These regulatory changes not only deterred students from making formal complaints, but also emboldened institutions to prolong grievance proceedings to exhaust and further deter students from accessing the Title IX process.\nAdvocates were frustrated with the Biden administration's year-long delay in issuing the new Title IX regulations, which have finally arrived to better protect students and are now facing legal scrutiny. While the Biden-era regulations balance due process for those accused of misconduct with the need to eradicate sex and gender-based discrimination, harassment, and violence within education, several Republican-led states have already filed lawsuits challenging the regulatory protections for LGBTQ students.\nThe outcome of these lawsuits will either help fuel or quell the ongoing \"culture wars\" within K-12 schools regarding the ability of minor students to freely express their chosen gender identity (as opposed to conforming to their assigned biological sex). On the horizon, the Biden administration will release more Title IX regulations addressing trans-athletes, which is a topic of ongoing controversy amongst policymakers.\nFor survivors of campus sexual misconduct, the new Title IX regulations undo some of the damage of the Trump-era rules by (1) ensuring former students and employees may file Title IX complaints when the accused is still at the educational institution, and allow such complaints to be made orally not just in writing, 34 C.F.R. § 106.2; (2) strongly endorsing the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard for adjudications unless the educational institution uses the heightened \"clear and convincing\" standard for all comparable misconduct proceedings, 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(h); (3) reminding institutions to issue sanctions for misconduct as well as remedies to the victim and other affected students to address resulting hostile environments on campus, 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(h)(3); and (4) clarifying that retaliation is another form of prohibited discrimination under Title IX to ensure the same procedures are followed by schools for such reports, 34 C.F.R. § 106.71. By undoing some of the barriers to justice established by the Trump-era rules, the new Title IX regulations rebalance Title IX to better advance victim protections and eliminate abuse.\nThe 2024 Title IX regulations are not likely to change the ongoing legal battles surrounding campus sexual misconduct or LGBTQ rights, but they will certainly help students equally access education in the interim, as our nation keeps working toward safer learning environments for all. The real question now is around how OCR will enforce the new regulations given the high volume of pending Title IX complaints under the Trump-era regulations and limited funding by Congress for such efforts. For those invested in safer schools, our next steps must be to call congressmembers to demand increased funding for Title IX enforcement to continue ensuring ongoing gender equality with federally funded educational settings into the future.\nLaura L.

    "content": "Around 47 children vanish every day in Europe, according to new research by cross-border journalism collective Lost in Europe showing more than 50,000 child migrants went missing after arrival over the past three years.\nData requested from 31 European countries, including Austria, Germany, and Italy, show at least 51,433 unaccompanied refugee minors were registered as missing between 2021 and the end of 2023. The actual figure could be higher due to inadequate documentation of cases, with some countries not collecting data on such children at all.\nThe research builds on findings released in 2021 that revealed at least 18,000 child migrants disappeared upon arrival in Europe in the three years from January 2018 to December 2020.\nAagje Ieven, secretary general for Missing Children Europe, a federation bringing together grassroots organizations across the continent, said the increased number of reported cases revealed by the research serves as a sharp reminder of the many instances  yet to be uncovered.\n“More of the iceberg is becoming visible, and that is a positive evolution,” she said, comparing the unreported cases to the bulk of the ice below the water’s surface. Out of 31 contacted countries, Lost in Europe received 20 responses, with seven lacking required data and 11 not responding — representing an improvement from 12 responses overall in 2021. Lost in Europe was able to find the data needed for two of the countries that did not respond, Italy and Slovakia, in official reports.\nItaly and Austria lead in registrations of missing unaccompanied minors, with 22,899 and 20,077 cases respectively, followed by Belgium, Germany and Switzerland with between roughly 2,200 and 1,200 reported cases.\nHowever, higher numbers in Italy and Austria do not necessarily indicate more cases, but that more efficient data collection systems are in place, Ieven said. ” We need to get all of the countries to more diligently report,” she told CNN, since children can be better protected if they are in the system.\nThe fate of missing unaccompanied migrant children is worrying, Ieven said. “They are at a higher risk of being targeted by traffickers, if not already exploited by smugglers to pay off debts, or because they hold control over their loved ones or their passports.”\nMultiple factors contribute to the disappearance of migrant children. There are concerns that some may have fallen prey to human traffickers or been subjected to exploitation in the sex industry. Others disappear voluntarily because they do not trust the authorities or to escape unsafe reception conditions.\nMany move to other countries to reunite with relatives or friends without registering it, Ieven said.\nIeven pointed out that the scarcity of opportunities for minors makes them vulnerable to exploitation, alongside the numerous traumas they endure prior to reaching Europe. A 2022 Ghent University study found that 84% of children experienced physical violence during their migration to Europe, with over 90% witnessing it.\nChildren make up around 40% of the world’s displaced people, according to the United Nations. While fleeing wars and conflicts, thousands of children find themselves separated from their families and relatives, and others travel alone, sent ahead by parents seeking to ensure their survival.\nAfghanistan was the country of origin for at least one in three unaccompanied minors who went missing in Europe between 2021 and 2023. The number of Afghan children arriving there increased following the Taliban takeover of power in August 2021.\nOther significant countries of origin include Syria, Tunisia, Egypt, and Morocco, according to the data collected by Lost in Europe.\nPatricia Durr, chief executive of ECPAT UK, a children’s rights organization, emphasized in comments to Lost in Europe that the situation represents a crisis in child protection, “exacerbated by punitive border policies and the lack of safe and legal routes for children in Europe to move between member states safely.”\nAn Austrian Ministry of the Interior spokesperson noted that the substantial influx of asylum applications from unaccompanied minor refugees presents specific challenges regarding legal representation and reception, Lost in Europe said.\nAs outlined in a 2020 report by the European Union-funded European Migration Network, most EU member states are mandated to report and register missing children within 24 hours, yet, as Ieven highlighted to CNN, this requirement is often not met.\nPatricia Durr raised further concerns about the impact that the EU’s new Pact on Migration and Asylum, approved by the European Parliament in April 2024, will have on children on the move. “Measures such as including children within detention for screening purposes is a clear breach of their rights under international law and will increase their vulnerability to going missing, abuse and trafficking,” she said.\nAccording to Ieven, registering migrant children and acknowledging their rights, including access to education, is crucial for their safety. “What will keep them safe is understanding that there is a future for them in the system, rather than outside of it,” she said.\nLost in Europe is a not-for-profit cross-border journalism project investigating the disappearance of child migrants in Europe.\n",

    "content": "Editor’s Note: Norman Eisen is a CNN legal analyst and editor of “Trying Trump: A Guide to His First Election Interference Criminal Trial.” He served as counsel to the House Judiciary Committee for the first impeachment and trial of then-President Donald Trump. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.\nMichael Cohen, the erstwhile lawyer and fixer of former President Donald Trump, was one of the first witnesses I interviewed as part of the first Trump impeachment: That was because I was investigating the identical 2016 alleged election interference now at issue in the former president’s hush money criminal trial.\nThe hard-charging Cohen had been by Trump’s side since 2006, had negotiated the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels to benefit the Trump campaign and was about to report to prison after pleading guilty in 2018 to campaign finance violations for that payment and to other crimes.\nI expected someone very different from the person I met, who was candid, remorseful and funny, if profane and possessed of a hatred of Trump. Cohen has never wavered since in the key details he provided me about the election scheme and its cover-up that will also be at the center of his testimony in Trump’s Manhattan criminal trial starting Monday. As we approach his keenly anticipated appearance, I think he, like Daniels did last week, will exceed expectations in how he presents to the jury.\nThe District Attorney’s Office has set that up with their work throughout the trial. They have methodically bolstered Cohen’s upcoming testimony with a series of credible witnesses and corroborating documents, gradually narrowing the universe of uncorroborated evidence that Cohen will provide.\nCohen will undoubtedly be the subject of a vigorous cross-examination that will likely include the many lies he now admits having told when he was associated with Trump, as well as Cohen’s guilty plea for perjury. But the prosecution’s effective strategy has significantly shortened the leap of faith the jury will have to take to believe him (as I did when I interviewed him).\nHere is how the prosecution has supported Cohen’s testimony in advance across three major aspects of the case.\nTrump’s intent was to benefit his campaign\nFirst, Cohen is expected to testify, based on his conversations with Trump, that the purpose of the payment to Daniels and the later alleged business record falsification was to benefit Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. The prosecution has already presented extensive evidence of this to the jury. For example, the former chief executive of American Media and the publisher of the National Enquirer, David Pecker, testified that he met with Trump and Cohen at Trump Tower in Manhattan in 2015 to hatch the “catch and kill” conspiracy with the explicit purpose of benefiting Trump’s campaign.\nPecker explained that for the scheme to further benefit Trump’s campaign, he later set in motion the hush money payment to Stormy Daniels. So when Cohen testifies that he discussed the payment with Trump and that his purpose included benefiting the campaign, that just represents the carrying forward of an intent that has already been corroborated.\nCNN legal analyst Norm Eisen is in the courtroom for former President Donald Trump’s Manhattan criminal trial and chronicling what he sees for this CNN Opinion series. Read previous installments:• You can’t deny the skill of Trump’s defense lawyers• The Trump team swung for the fences. Thanks to Stormy Daniels, they struck out• What Trump may not have expected from Stormy Daniels’ testimony\nTo take another example, the jury also heard evidence of Trump’s own words suggesting that the purpose of the scheme was to benefit his campaign. Former Trump aide Hope Hicks testified that when the Daniels scandal emerged in 2018, the former president told her that it was better to be dealing with Daniels’ allegation of a sexual encounter with him at that time, because “it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election.”\nHicks further testified that Trump admitted to her that he knew Cohen had paid Daniels. Trump claimed Cohen made the payment on his own and not at Trump’s direction, but Hicks did not believe him. She explained it was implausible that Cohen would have paid Daniels absent Trump’s instruction.\nThe Trump Tower meetings: Formulating the scheme\nCohen will likely testify about a second meeting at Trump’s office that took place between October 10 and October 28, 2016, with former Trump Organization finance chief Allen Weisselberg in attendance, where Trump agreed to pay Daniels the $130,000. According to Cohen, Trump said “it is not a lot of money, and we should just do it, so go ahead and do it.” Trump then allegedly directed Cohen and Weisselberg to “figure this all out.” The two allegedly met again in early January in Trump Tower to do that, and then confirmed it with Trump.\nKeith Davidson, Daniels’ former attorney who negotiated her hush-money payment, made clear during his testimony that he believed Trump was responsible for final approval of the funds. He testified that he was under the belief that Cohen needed Trump’s approval to wire any funds and that Trump was the source. Davidson maintained that he never believed Cohen was the ultimate source of the funds, affirming the money was expected to come from Trump or an associated corporate body.\nFormer Trump Organization accountant Deborah Tarasoff also told the jury that Trump was directly involved in reimbursing Cohen. Tarasoff detailed how payments shifted from the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust to being personally made by Trump in 2017, reflecting a deeper personal engagement. She recounted processing checks for Trump’s signature, including one for $70,000 signed by Weisselberg and Eric Trump and a $35,000 check from Trump’s personal account.\nThis evidence was pivotal in challenging the defense’s assertion that Trump was detached from the transactions, clearly showing he actively repaid Cohen, including during his time in the White House.\nRelated article\nHere are all the bad things witnesses have said about Michael Cohen, Trump’s former fixer who is set to testify Monday\nThe White House meeting: Reimbursing Cohen\nCohen is also expected to testify that he met Trump in the White House in February 2017, and there Trump again agreed to the repayment plan that Weisselberg had concocted. Trump then proceeded to personally sign checks to Cohen from the Oval Office for the rest of the year. The DA’s office has already elicited testimony that corroborates this meeting and reimbursement scheme and highlights Trump’s frugality and check-signing practices.\nFor example, Trump Organization controller Jeffrey McConney was able to testify to Weisselberg’s handwritten note — “I’ve been looking at his handwriting for 35 years,” McConney said, confirming he recognized it — that spelled out the exact repayment scheme that Trump used to reimburse Cohen for the hush money. This key physical evidence from McConney and Weisselberg, who may not testify himself, independently establishes the “grossed up” amount that Trump then paid Cohen after their February 2017 meeting.\nMadeleine Westerhout, a former Trump aide who sat just outside the Oval Office and had direct line of sight to Trump’s desk, was able to testify both to scheduling Cohen’s physical presence at the White House for the February reimbursement meeting and to Trump’s business practices early in his administration. She spoke at length about how Trump continued to focus on personal and Trump Organization business minutiae while in the White House.\nThis supports the notion that Trump would have, in the same time period, paid close attention to the $35,000 checks he was signing for Cohen. Westerhout also read aloud her email confirming, to Cohen the February meeting at the White House.\nSign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook\nLastly, Sally Franklin, a senior vice president at book publisher Penguin Random House, quoted from Trump’s own books and own words about his check-signing and other practices that corroborate Cohen’s story over and over again.\nFor example, in “Trump: Think Like a Billionaire,” a chapter titled “How to Pinch Pennies” contained Trump saying, “I received a check for fifty cents, and we at The Trump Organization deposited it. They may call that cheap; I called it watching the bottom line… As I said before, I always sign my checks so I know where my money’s going. In the same spirit, I also always try to read my bills to make sure I’m not being overcharged.”\nTo be sure, the defense will come after Cohen on cross with his prior lies in service of Trump, his perjury conviction and more. But because Cohen is so strongly corroborated, believing him will not require a leap of faith for the jury — more like a short hop. When that is combined with the brutally unfiltered, heart-on-his-sleeve person I first met back in 2019, you get a witness who may surprise us all, and certainly the jury, by exceeding expectations.\n",

    "content": "A top Russian official has mocked President Joe Biden and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky over Kyiv's mobilization efforts, saying that the two leaders should be included in the draft.\nVyacheslav Volodin, who is speaker of Russia's parliament, the Duma, made the comments on his Telegram channel following reports that the Ukrainian defense ministry had updated criteria for those deemed suitable for military service.\nFacing a shortage of troops following high losses, Ukraine's parliament in April passed legislation aimed to replenish the country's fighting forces as they try to hold back Russian momentum in offensives along the eastern part of the frontline.\nUkraine's mobilization law offers financial incentives, death benefits for the families of those who are killed and penalties for men trying to evade service.\nVolodin responded to a report by Ukrainian outlet Strana—considered to be in opposition to the current Ukrainian government—describing Kyiv's latest criteria for suitability for military service.\nThis included allowing those with illnesses such, cancer TB and HIV being still being able to serve if the illnesses were asymptomatic or had not reached a serious stage.\nThe Strana report, which was picked up by Russian state media outlets, also noted how the criteria would allow those with mild mental illnesses to be sent to serve in the war. This was seized upon by Volodin who used disparaging language about mental illness to take aim at Zelensky and Biden.\n\"According to these criteria, the first who should be drafted into the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are Biden as a mentally challenged person, as well as his friend Zelensky as a mental patient dependent on various drugs,\" Volodin wrote.\nNewsweek has contacted the White House and Zelensky's office for comment.\nFaced by dwindling troop numbers and calls from relatives of troops on the frontline for soldiers to be rotated, Ukraine faces a critical shortage of personnel as Russia gears up for an expected offensive in the coming weeks.\nWhile many had volunteered for Ukraine's war effort at the start of Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion, high losses as the war dragged on has led to around 650,000 military-aged Ukrainians fleeing the country, through bribes, illegal crossings or fake medical records, according to the BBC.\nLast August, Zelensky fired conscription officers who accepted bribes from those trying to avoid mobilization. The Ukrainian foreign ministry announced on April 24 it would suspend consular services to Ukrainian men overseas aged between 18 and 60 except for those returning. Kyiv has also banned the delivery of identification documents to Ukrainian men of military age abroad.\n",

First carved large onto small “Venus” figurines some 25,000 years ago as totems of fertility, they’re now seen (or hidden) as a potent symbol of desire, motherhood, feminism, sexism, beauty ideals, defiance, controversy or illness, depending on context.\nAnd these are all themes explored broadly in the exhibition “Breasts,” a robust survey on display at the 60th Venice Bienniale. Hosted at the Palazzo Franchetti, the show includes artworks by household names such as Cindy Sherman, Robert Mapplethorpe and Salvador Dalí, as well as early-career artists including Anna Weyant, Chloe Wise and Lakin Ogunbanwo. Divided into five rooms against the building’s art deco designs, the artworks are meant to be in conversation with one another — and with exhibition-goers — according to the show’s curator Carolina Pasti.\n“It’s very intimate, so it’s perfect for international artists to develop a dialogue with each other,” she said in a video call.\nRelated article\nWhat to see at the 2024 Venice Biennale\nOne of the first juxtapositions visitors encounter is between the exhibition’s earliest work, an early 16th-century Madonna and child by Bernardino del Signoraccio, and a self-portrait by Sherman which depicts the artist draped in prosthetic breasts and a pregnant belly. Both images of motherhood feature exaggerated anatomy — the baby Jesus in Del Signoraccio’s panel painting exposing his mother’s rigid bosom, while Sherman displays a hyperreal silicone torso in her riff on the Raphael painting “La Fornarina” — and sets the stage by showing how Renaissance artists have continued to influence our attitudes around breasts today.\nFrom there, the show winds through painting, sculpture and design, photography, commercial advertising and video art, exploring the ways that breasts have been seen and represented through both the male and female gazes.\n“It goes back to cave paintings — we’ve always been fascinated with the human form, and particularly the female form, which has this incredible allure and mystery,” said the artist Teniqua Crawford, who is exhibiting a delicate rendering of the breast as landscape. “Artists keep going back to it.”\n“It’s been a wonderful moment to contemplate my own relationship with the meaning of  breasts,” she added of the show.\n“Breasts” was staged, in part, to promote breast cancer awareness, and marks a partnership with the medical research non-profit Fondazione IEO-MONZINO, which will receive a portion of its catalog sales. It’s a theme apparent throughout the show, with a vivid pink staging and backdrops inspired by the color of the cause. That includes a passageway designed by Buchanan Studio, “Booby Trap” which is draped in pink fabric and features 35 anatomical lights from above.\nAnd the opening night treats? All according to the theme, of course, with suggestively shaped chocolate bon bons and burrata.\nScroll to see artworks from the show, which will run through November 24 at the Palazzo Franchetti.\n",

Four countries—Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Belgium—have committed to providing F-16 aircraft to Ukraine to boost its depleted fleet of Soviet-era planes, up against superior and more numerous Russian aircraft.\n\"Ukrainian forces may be attempting to degrade Russian air defenses ahead of anticipated F-16 fighter jet deliveries to Ukraine,\" the ISW evaluated. If Kyiv succeeds, it might be able to more effectively use the Lockheed Martin-made jets, the think tank added.\nNewsweek has reached out to the Ukrainian military for comment via email.\nKyiv had long requested the F-16s, although when exactly the aircraft would arrive and be operational has never been clear. They are expected in the next few weeks, although delays and vagueness have plagued the timetables laid out by donating countries.\nUkrainian pilots have been undergoing training in several NATO nations while Kyiv puts in place the necessary infrastructure to operate the aircraft.\nOnce the jets arrive, they will be an \"absolute magnet for Russian air defenses and Russian aircraft,\" Frank Ledwidge, senior lecturer in Law and War Studies at Portsmouth University in the U.K. and a former British military intelligence officer, previously told Newsweek.\nUkraine has carried out a string of attacks on Russia's expensive air defense assets that would pose a danger to its prized F-16 fleet once the aircraft are airborne.\nOn Wednesday, Ukraine's military said its forces had destroyed S-300 and S-400 air defense radar systems in an overnight strike on Crimea.\nThe systems were stationed near one of Russia's military airfields close to the Crimean port city of Sevastopol, where Ukraine has repeatedly struck Russia's Black Sea naval fleet, Kyiv said. Russian military bloggers and Ukrainian sources reported that ATACMS were used.\nEarlier this week, Ukraine said it had \"successfully attacked\" one Russian S-400 anti-aircraft missile system near Dzhankoy—a key road and rail hub for Russia in northern Crimea—and two S-300 systems near Chornomorske and Yevpatoria, in the west of the peninsula. Russian military bloggers suggested ATACMS were responsible for the strikes.\nReports also indicated Kyiv destroyed part of an S-300 or S-400 air defense battery over the border in Russia's Belgorod region in early June. The loss of air defense capabilities in Belgorod, which looks onto Ukraine's northeastern Kharkiv region, reportedly led Russia to transfer air defenses from Crimea in recent weeks, the ISW think tank noted.\nSeparately, Ukraine said it had damaged two of Russia's advanced Su-57 stealth fighter jets hundreds of miles into Russian territory earlier this month.\nS-300 and S-400 air defense systems, plus Su-57 jets, \"are significant Russian air defense and aviation assets that deny Ukraine the ability to fly aircraft near the front and support Russian offensive operations in Ukraine,\" the ISW said on Wednesday.\nA senior Ukrainian aviation commander said earlier this week that Kyiv will store some of its Western-donated F-16 fighter jet fleet in \"secure air bases\" outside of the country to avoid Russian strikes on the advanced aircraft.\nExperts previously suggested to Newsweek that the number of F-16s Ukraine will operate is too small to make a strategic difference across the entire front line, and Russia has likely made use of the months since the donations of the jets were revealed to prepare.\n",

As I walked along the beaches, the fast-moving tide of the Bay of the Seine washing over my feet, I felt the enduring bond of the Allies—a bond that continues to shape our present and future. It reminded me of the courage and resolve of soldiers from 13 nations who stormed those beaches 80 years ago, under a sky filled with uncertainty but fueled by a singular purpose: to reclaim freedom from tyranny.\nFive years later, NATO emerged from the ashes of that conflict, a testament to the collective resolve to prevent future wars and uphold democratic values. Today, NATO represents a shared vision of peace and democracy that binds its members together, a vision as vital now as it was when the alliance was formed over seven decades ago.\nArticle 5 of NATO's Washington Treaty, which asserts that an attack on one member is an attack on all, has served as a powerful deterrent against aggression. During the Cold War, NATO contained Soviet expansion, preventing another war in Europe. Now, with Russia's resurgence and China's growing influence, NATO's role in maintaining peace and stability is more crucial now than it's ever been.\nOver the past 75 years, NATO has evolved to address a wide range of security challenges. From combating terrorism and cyber threats to managing regional conflicts, NATO's adaptability and commitment to crisis management and conflict prevention have ensured that regional instabilities do not escalate into broader conflicts. NATO's interventions in the Balkans, its role in Afghanistan post-9/11, and its efforts against piracy off the Horn of Africa are examples of its enduring relevance.\nReflecting to 1949, we see a Europe still recovering from the ruins of war, with the specter of tyranny looming large. United by a vision of peace, nations came together to form NATO to ensure that the horrors of the past were never repeated. Beyond collective defense, this alliance promoted political stability and democratic governance—vital ingredients for global peace and security.\nAs the Cold War thawed, Eastern European countries, once under authoritarian regimes, began to see new opportunities. With NATO's support, these nations embarked on a journey of democratic reforms and economic progress. NATO, standing firm on its principles, helped these countries transform, reinforcing democratic governance as the bedrock of global stability.\nCertainly, NATO faces challenges, including disparities in defense spending and rising nationalism within its ranks. Yet, it remains the most successful alliance in the history of the free world.\nRussia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has ignited the bloodiest conflict in Europe since World War II, reinforcing NATO's vital role in deterring aggression and maintaining peace. This invasion and the searing images we see from that war are glaring reminders of the ongoing need for a strong, unified NATO to confront emerging challenges and protect national sovereignty.\nLast week, walking along Omaha Beach with the runnels in the sand tracing their ancient patterns, I reflected on the brave men who stormed ashore under withering enemy fire. The current threats we face across the Atlantic and beyond make it clear: There is a direct thread from Omaha Beach to Brussels.\nIn those quiet moments, I realized that only by strengthening these bonds can we truly honor the memory of those who gave their last full measure of devotion on the beaches of Normandy. We owe it to them to carry their legacy forward with the same resolve and dedication, in our own lives, and in the alliance that has prevented another world war from occurring.\nColonel John Fenzel is a retired Army special forces officer, and the CEO of The World War II Foundation.\nThe views expressed in this article are the writer's own.\n",

    "content": "Archaeologists have unearthed the remains of an ancient Egyptian fortified royal retreat.\nThe mud-brick rest house was uncovered at the archaeological site of Tel Hebwa in the north of the Sinai Peninsula, the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities (MTA) announced in a statement.\nPreliminary research at the site has indicated that the structure dates back to the reign of King Thutmose III, the sixth pharaoh of ancient Egypt's 18th Dynasty in the New Kingdom period.\nSometimes called Thutmose the Great, the pharaoh is thought to have ruled from 1479 B.C. until his death at the age of 56 in 1425 B.C. He is regarded as one of the greatest military commanders in history, helping to expand Egypt's empire to its greatest extent thanks to a succession of victorious campaigns.\nIt is likely that the ancient building in Sinai was used as a royal rest house thanks to the architectural layout and the scarcity of pottery shards found inside, according to the MTA. The pharaoh himself may have used the facility during his military campaigns to expand the Egyptian empire to the east, researchers believe.\nThe building consists of two consecutive rectangular halls, accompanied by a number of rooms. It appears to have been fortified with a perimeter wall.\n\"This discovery is pivotal as it illuminates crucial aspects of Egypt's military history, particularly in the Sinai region, during the New Kingdom era,\" said Mohamed Ismail Khaled, Secretary-General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, as reported by Ahram Online.\nArchaeological work at the site also uncovered a number of burials, indicating that it was used as a cemetery during later periods in ancient Egyptian history.\nThe latest discovery is just one of many ancient finds reported from Egypt in recent months.\nFor example, archaeologists announced earlier this year that they had uncovered the missing upper part of a \"huge\" statue depicting an ancient Egyptian pharaoh.\nA joint Egyptian-American archaeological mission discovered the statue part during excavations conducted at the southern border of the Khemenu/Hermopolis Magna archaeological site, Yvona Trnka-Amrhein, one of the leaders of the project, previously told Newsweek.\nThe ancient city of Khemenu was a provincial capital since Egypt's Old Kingdom and developed into a major settlement during the Roman period.\nIn January, another team unearthed several ancient tombs with dozens of mummies—including some with golden tongues—at the ancient city of Oxyrhynchus, an extensive archaeological site located around 100 miles south-southwest of Cairo near the modern-day municipality of Al-Bahnasa in Minya Governorate.\nOxyrhynchus was \"very important\" during ancient Egypt's Greco-Roman period, which spanned hundreds of years from the late fourth century B.C. until the 7th century, Esther Pons Mellado and Maite Mascort, co-directors of a Spanish archaeological mission at the site, previously told Newsweek.\n\"[It] was the second city of Egypt after Alexandria. There was a great business and cultural relationship between these two cities,\" they said.\n",

    "content": "Novak Djokovic said he’s “looking forward” to the chance of winning a record-breaking 25th grand slam singles title at the French Open this year.\nSpeaking to CNN’s Amanda Davies after winning a joint-record fifth Laureus World Sportsman of the Year trophy on Monday, Djokovic said he has visualized the moment of becoming the most successful singles player – men’s or women’s – in history.\nThe Serbian superstar has won 24 grand slam singles titles to date – the most of any man – and currently shares the all-time record with Margaret Court. He will have the chance to break the record when the French Open starts on May 20.\n“You take nothing but the win, that’s the mentality. You kind of visualise yourself achieving that already. So I’ve been, you know, really looking forward to it,” Djokovic said.\n“Of course I’m not the only one that wants to grab that title but I look forward to it. I like competing with different generations. You have the young guys who are coming up … they’re all incredibly hungry and fit and fast.\n“But I use my adaptability to adjust my tactics and my game to them and understand really what it takes, you know, what it takes to stay at the top and compete with these guys and try to win more titles.”\nSportswoman of the Year: Aitana BonmatíSportsman of the Year: Novak DjokovicBreakthrough of the Year: Jude BellinghamSportsperson with Disability: Diede de GrootTeam of the Year: Spain women’s national teamComeback of the Year: Simone Biles\nDjokovic was awarded his Laureus award by NFL great Tom Brady after a remarkable 2023 season where he won three out of the four grand slams.\nThe pair have grown close over the years and Brady praised his friend for not only being an “amazing player and talent” but “a great man, too.”\n“[He] has great integrity,” Brady told CNN, standing alongside Djokovic.\n“I think what you’ve seen over all these years, the competition always, in my view, brings out the best in people and it certainly has brought out the best in him.”\nDespite turning 37 later this year, Djokovic said he has no plans of slowing down and is not close to contemplating retirement.\nThe focus, he said, is very much on the next tournament, rather than looking back on his achievements.\n“I feel like it’s so important to always remind yourself to be in the present moment, really to appreciate, to acknowledge, to remember where you came from, the journey, the path, also the people that surround you,” Djokovic said.\n“Every single week there’s something new happening and new events. So I think I will truly be able to appreciate everything that we have accomplished really, only post-career, to be honest.\n“Because while you’re still active … it’s what’s the next task? What’s the next challenge?\n“You have only maybe a few days or a week max where you’re contemplating on a great success.”\nIf Djokovic needs any tips on preparing for retirement then Brady could be the man to turn to.\nThe former quarterback initially retired in 2022 but came back to play one season before eventually stepping away last year.\n“I was very happy with the way things ended for me and now I get to sit back and watch him [Djokovic] and I got to go to the El Clásico last night,” Brady said.\n“You will always love the competition, that will never go away. You’ll always love the sport, but I think there’s also different ways you can contribute as you go through life.”\nSpeaking about how elite athletes manage to adapt to retirement, Brady added: “We rarely look back. We always want to look forward because we’re ambitious people.\n“I think to be in this situation that we’ve been fortunate to be in, it takes a lot of ambition and it’s not like a switch you just turn off.\n“So you just keep going as long as you can, and you try to make the best of every opportunity you get.”\n",

    "content": "Lake Mead's projections are improving following two consecutive wet winters, with zero risk of falling below 1,000 feet before 2028, new Bureau of Reclamation figures show.\nThe figures, released on May 29, show the Nevada-Arizona reservoir's five-year outlook much improved. The projections are updated three times a year and show a range of scenarios that influence potential water use cuts based on varying reservoir levels.\nOne key takeaway from the latest projections is the zero percent chance that Lake Mead will fall below 1,000 feet before 2028. This is a notable improvement from January's projection, which estimated a 3 percent chance.\nHowever, the projections also show a 13 percent chance that the reservoir could fall below 1,020 feet by 2028, a figure that remains unchanged from January. The lowest recorded elevation for Lake Mead was 1,040.58 feet in 2022, highlighting the ongoing risks despite recent improvements. The variability in the projections underscores the impact of weather conditions, which can significantly alter the reservoir's future.\nAny changes in Lake Mead's water levels are important, as in recent years, the reservoir, which stores water for 25 million people living in the region, has fallen well below average.\nIn July 2022, the lake reached a record low of 1,040 feet, the lowest it has been since it was first constructed in the 1930s. This was mainly due to prolonged drought conditions that plagued the southwestern U.S. for years.\nThese conditions, paired with the region's overconsumption of water, meant that water resources were being used more quickly than they were being replenished.\nThe five-year projections are even more important as the 2007 Colorado River interim guidelines are set to expire in 2026. Alongside this, two groups of Colorado River states continue to debate how to manage the ongoing water scarcity crisis, including the operational strategies for reservoir releases.\nThe U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is expected to release a two-year projection in mid-June that will determine whether Nevada needs to implement further water usage cuts. Last year, Nevada had to reduce its Colorado River allotment by an additional 4,000 acre-feet based on June's projection.\nWhile the latest projections offer some hope for improved conditions at Lake Mead, the broader context of climate variability and interstate water politics suggests that significant challenges remain. The upcoming two-year projection will be a critical indicator for southern Nevada, potentially influencing water management decisions for the near future.\n",

Like Wordle, a word-based game that took the English-speaking world by storm during the height of the coronavirus pandemic, Connections quickly gained both success and a dedicated fan base trying each day to crack the categories.\nThe idea of the game is to sort a total of 16 words into four categories, each made up of four words. The words in each category all share something in common, and it's your goal to figure out what exactly that is.\nThe categories differ in difficulty—those in the blue category tend to be the easiest to guess. After that, there are the yellow and green categories, and those words lighting up purple are often the hardest to guess. Some words may have several meanings and could fall into a number of categories, so watch out for those!\nOnce you make your selections, you can press \"submit,\" and see if you're right. If you're not, you'll lose one of four lives, so make sure to think through your answers!\nTo help you on your way, Newsweek has compiled a few hints to help you deduce each of today's Connections categories.\nYellow: The words in this category are all ways of describing positive results from effort.\nGreen: This category is looking for you to think of all the different types of bagels.\nBlue: For this, have a think about how a movie is made.\nPurple: All of the words in this category are shortened forms of classic monsters.\nYellow Category: Something gained from hard work\nYellow Words: Reward, Fruit, Benefit, Return\nGreen Category: Kinds of bagels\nGreen Words: Egg, Everything, Poppy, Plain\nBlue Category: Contribute to a movie\nBlue Words: Act, Direct, Produce, Write\nPurple Category: Starts of monsters\nPurple Words: Frank, Mum, Vamp, Were\nIf you managed to guess all the answers correctly, well done!

    "content": "Editor’s Note: Clarissa Wei is a Taiwanese American journalist and author living in Taipei. Her cookbook, “Made in Taiwan: Recipes and Stories From The Island Nation,” was published in 2023. The views expressed in this commentary are her own.\nWhen my parents were growing up in the 1970s, they did not consider Taiwan an idyllic place to start a family. It was under martial law and the steady drumbeat of threats from China only seemed to be getting louder with each passing year. My dad still remembers the anxiety that engulfed the island when the United States cut off diplomatic recognition of Taiwan in favor of the People’s Republic of China in 1979. “We weren’t sure if America would protect us if there was conflict,” he told me.\nAnd so, in their late 20s, they left everything they knew and moved to the suburbs of Los Angeles where I was born. They weren’t the only ones; roughly 20% of Taiwanese college graduates went abroad for advanced study in the 1970s and 1980s. Few returned.\nThis article is part of a CNN Opinion series where each month leading up to the US election, a writer in a different country explores how locals view America and why the choice of the next president matters to them.\nMy parents considered America a safe haven and wanted me to grow up with all its comforts. Whereas they grew up in cramped moldy buildings, I spent my childhood in a four-bedroom house with a backyard and a swimming pool.\nWhereas they walked to school on uneven sidewalks in a cloud of pollution, my mother drove me to school every day in a comfy SUV. My parents were raised under the shadow of martial law, where folks were jailed and killed for speaking their mind. I was raised in the land of the free, where freedom of speech is enshrined in the constitution as a human right.\nAnd yet, decades later, I ended up doing the exact opposite of what my parents did. In 2020 at the cusp of the global pandemic, I moved to Taiwan with my husband. Last year, I gave birth to a baby boy in Taipei.\nThreats from China have not abated. In fact, tensions have reached such historic highs that Taiwan is often dubbed “the world’s most dangerous place” by international analysts. This perception is so pervasive that every time my husband and I leave Taiwan, we are greeted with wide-eyed concern by friends and family. Are we safe in Taiwan? Do we think China will attack?\nThough my perspective may be myopic (given the very real possibility of conflict and a military blockade) and comes from a place of privilege (I am a dual citizen of both Taiwan and the United States), there’s currently nowhere else I’d rather be.\nA lot has changed over the past 30 years as Taiwan has transitioned from a dictatorship to a vibrant democracy.\nIn Taiwan, power is handed over peacefully while it’s no longer a certainty in the US.\nIn Taiwan, guns are illegal. In America, guns are a leading cause of death to children.\nTaiwan has universal health care; I can pop into any clinic or hospital for immediate and affordable treatment. My entire medical record can be accessed instantaneously via a chip on my health card. In America, medical insurance is opaque and not guaranteed.\nThe contrasts are especially stark now that I am a new mother. The Taiwanese subway system has designated seating areas for pregnant women and children, and there are breastfeeding rooms at every major station.\nThe city has free play centers for children stocked with a wide range of toys. All new parents in Taipei are eligible for monthly cash handouts, and certified daycares and at-home nannies services are subsidized by the city government. In the States, only low-income families qualify for financial aid.\nOf course, comparing the United States and Taiwan this way without acknowledging the nuanced socio-political contexts can be misleading. While the American health care system is notoriously difficult to navigate, it is far more advanced and state-of-the-art than Taiwan’s.\nWhile Taiwan is great for babies, it can be stressful for school-aged children; the education system emphasizes rote memorization and stifles creative freedom. My husband and I are not convinced we want to stay in Taiwan forever, but America, with its shocking lack of family-friendly policies, is on the bottom of the list of places we’d consider moving to.\nMany Taiwanese people still hold the United States in high regard, but more as a military ally and defender of the island. During the 2020 American presidential election, many in Taiwan rooted for Donald Trump specifically because of his aggressive anti-China rhetoric.\nDuring this year’s election cycle, however, opinions are much more muted. President Joe Biden has defied skeptics by maintaining a tough stance against China over the last four years and pro-Trump sentiments have waned considerably, especially in light of recent comments by the former president accusing Taiwan of taking away America’s semiconductor business.\n“As long as the United States continues to show both symbolic and substantive support and collaboration with Taiwan, I don’t think Taiwanese people actually care who the next US president is,“ Wei-Ting Yen, an assistant professor at Franklin & Marshall College in the US who specializes in Asian countries, told me over a video call.\nMy friends in the States are convinced I’m living in a highly volatile and dangerous place. But Taiwanese people harbor similar beliefs about the States.\nClarissa Wei\nThe biggest shift, then, has been how the people of Taiwan perceive the United States. While it remains a popular immigration destination for those who can afford it, America has lost its luster as a sanctuary. My friends in the States are convinced I’m living in a highly volatile and dangerous place. But Taiwanese people harbor similar beliefs about the States.\nRecently at a Chinese medicine shop in Taipei, the owner asked if I felt safe walking down the streets of Los Angeles. He was under the impression that all the major American cities had become wildly unsafe in the last couple of years, rampant with crime and shootings. “Aren’t there guns everywhere?” he asked sincerely. “It sounds so messy.”\n“I’m definitely more comfortable here,” I responded, not wanting to get into the specifics.\nHe nodded deeply. “Taiwan is safer,” he said.\nIt’s not so much that the United States has become more dangerous (that is the perception, but statistics show otherwise); it’s more that I have gotten used to letting my guard down. In Taipei, I can walk down dark alleyways long past midnight with my purse wide open without fear of getting robbed. I can leave my phone, wallet and laptop on a coffee shop table, go to the bathroom, and be certain that my possessions will all be there when I come back. Some of my friends don’t even lock their front doors. I would not feel comfortable doing any of the above in America.\nAccording to last year’s Global Peace Index, Taiwan is the 33rd most peaceful state or territory in the world. The United States, on the flip side, is the 131st.\nLast year when my husband and I were in the San Francisco Bay Area for a wedding, our friends instructed us not to not leave anything valuable in the car. Coming from Taiwan, we didn’t think much of the advice, until we were looking for parking one day and noticed all the broken car window glass on the streets.\nLately, my parents and many of their friends living in the US have been planning their retirement to Taiwan. Emboldened with dual citizenship and the option of being able to leave the island in the worst-case scenario, they are no longer affected by the anxiety of their youth.\nNow in his 60s, my father is convinced the Chinese threat will not materialize. While I don’t agree with him, I understand his point of view. Cross-strait tensions have been strained for seven decades already and, with each passing year, the conflict feels more abstract in spite of the heightened rhetoric and airspace incursions because, eventually, you become numb to it.\nChina’s Communist Party considers Taiwan a part of its territory - despite never having controlled it. They have not ruled out force to annex Taiwan.\nThe possibility of war hangs over like a persistent dark cloud. If you think about it long enough, it makes you nervous and clammy. But because it’s a plausibility, not an immediate reality, it’s easy to ignore. If anything, political violence and upheaval in the States seems far more likely, especially since it would not be unprecedented. On a day-to-day basis, at least, Taiwan seems like the more sensible place to live.\nI asked my dad — a lifelong Republican — who he believed was a bigger threat this year: Chinese president Xi Jinping or former president Donald Trump.\nHe responded without hesitation. “Trump,” he said. “Because he’s more unpredictable.”\n",

    "content": "Three bewildered children sit on the roof of a mosque in Baghlan province, northern Afghanistan, their eyes blinking away mud that covers their entire bodies.\nBeside them, a rescuer lowers their baby brother, 2-year-old Arian, to the rooftop, a sheet tied around his waist that was used to pull him from the raging floodwaters below.\n“Take it, let’s get take off the rope from his body,” the rescuer says on the video. “Bring his mother to hold him in her arms and be warm.”\nIn the past few days, at least 300 people have been killed in flooding in 18 districts across at least three provinces in northern Afghanistan, according to the United Nations’ World Food Programme (WFP), with at least 200 injured.\nVideos show raging torrents of mud washing away mud houses – and people, their limbs flailing, in the fast-moving brown current, as would-be rescuers watch from higher ground, beyond reach.\nThe rescued children, ages 3, 5 and 6, were among eight siblings who were at home with their parents in Folo, in the Bulka district of Baghlan, when the flooding hit.\nTheir uncle Barakatullah, son of Haji Wakil Besmillah, the local school headmaster, told CNN something ominous seemed to be brewing late last week when severe wind swept through the district and neighboring areas, enveloping everything in darkness.\n“Visibility was so poor that we couldn’t even see each other,” he said.\nThen the rain started falling gently during Friday prayers – an unusual event for locals, who say it doesn’t rain very often so high in the mountain region, home to around 10,000 people, he added.\nAs the rain got heavier, suddenly the situation “turned dire.”\n“People fled to higher ground, seeking refuge in mountains and hills. Unfortunately, some individuals who were unable to leave their homes fell victim to the floodwaters,” he said.\nAerial photos show belongings piled in plastic bags on rooftops, among them the hooded figures of women forced to cover their entire bodies even in times of disaster.\n“Women who were rescued are forced to wear mud-soaked garments, while even infants as young as 2 to 3 months old are clothed in similarly soiled attire,” Barakatullah said.\nIn Folo, more than 100 people are believed to have been killed, he said – mostly women and children.\nSome burials began over the weekend, but many more are already believed to be buried deep beneath mud.\nThe torrent swept away animals and farmland in an area already facing severe food shortages, according to Timothy Anderson, head of the WFP in Afghanistan.\nHe said the areas hit by floods had already been marked vulnerable to starvation after a difficult summer when searing heat brought drought.\n“It was already pretty grim. And now it’s catastrophic,” he told CNN.\nMost years, locals expect to see flash flooding, he said. But this year, it’s been far worse.\nThe loss of the homes and their land is devastating for survivors, who were already among some of the country’s most impoverished people, Anderson said.\n“When people lose a bit of livestock, that’s actually their livelihood,” he said.\nRoad access to the worst affected areas has been cut by floodwaters, forcing the WFP to use donkeys to send in supplies.\nWithin the first day, the WFP had distributed high energy biscuits and food for children. They’re also supporting local bakeries to supply free bread. In the next days, teams will start distributing food to feed families for a month – what happens next is unclear.\nAnderson said 17 joint assessment teams are being sent to the area, along with other UN partners. He said it’ll take four or five days for the teams to properly examine the impact of the floods on people, and their housing and infrastructure.\nThis latest natural disaster comes after drought in Afghanistan, and is being seen as an example of a climate crisis hitting those who have least contributed to rising global temperatures.\n“They’re not net emitters of carbon,” said Anderson of the WFP. “This is a subsistence agriculture community and society. So, they’re bearing the brunt of it, without having necessarily contributed to the issue very much.”\nHe said during the recent dry months, efforts had been made to help the community capture rainfall in dams and irrigation canals to sustain crops. Now those efforts have been washed away, posing another challenge.\n“The need is massive, not just in Afghanistan. The world is seeing the impacts of much larger, more severe events, whether that’s drought, rainfalls cyclones,” Anderson said.\nRichard Bennett, the UN’s special rapporteur on human rights in Afghanistan said the recent floods “are a stark reminder of Afghanistan’s vulnerability to the climate crisis.”\nAnd in a statement Sunday, Teresa Anderson, the Global Climate Justice Lead at ActionAid International, said: “The climate crisis continues to rear its ugly head.”\n“With the latest incident, Afghanistan joins a long list of Global South countries grappling with floods this year,” she said.\n",

    "content": "With the news of former President Donald Trump's conviction in a New York trial, the nation has made a milestone out of a mickey mouse moment. A former president has not only been put on trial, he has been convicted of 34 felonies. Unfortunately, the convictions arise from the fetid fallout of a hush money payment to a porn star.\nOf course, key underlying events in this case occurred prior to Trump's presidency, but the prospect of a president paying in court for his misdeeds is unprecedented. It is both something to be proud of and, in more than one way, something to be ashamed of.\nTrump's conviction is something to be proud of because it affirms a fundamental American value—no one in this country is above the law. Trump seems to have lived his life thinking that the rules constraining ordinary mortals don't apply to him. His life has been soaked with scandals from which he, until recently, has walked away.\nHe has repeatedly been accused of cheating contractors, students at his unaccredited Trump University, donors to his charity, the Internal Revenue Service, and campaign donors. The public has watched as he made his way through serial failed enterprises to find genuine success on reality TV and to win the presidency. He was then accused of abusing that office in numerous ways ranging from subsidizing his hotels with government and foreign funds to advertising his wife's jewelry line on the White House website.\nBut now a reckoning has come in New York, the longtime base of his enterprises. He has been found by courts there to have engaged in fraud, rape, and repeated contempts of court. His current fortune has been found to have been buttressed by loan-inducing frauds and, most recently, a projected $100 million in double-dipped tax deductions.\nSo yes, we should be proud to see the claims against Trump decided in court by the rules that rightly apply to all of us. The United States can't run a credible justice system without hearing and deciding claims against the rich and powerful as well as the merely ordinary.\nBut this is where we can start talking about why we should be ashamed. We should be ashamed that the Trump legal saga has lowered the legal system in the minds of the American public. Partisan attacks from the left and the right on judges and prosecutors have shaken our system. Donald Trump has been particularly egregious in telling Americans that his trials are being secretly masterminded by President Joe Biden and his \"gestapo\" while unintentionally undercutting his claims by labelling Biden totally incompetent. If Biden were nefariously manipulating American law enforcement, Trump would be in jail and Biden's son would not be facing charges for misstating his drug use on a firearm permit application.\nBut now for the greatest shame. Maybe some of Trump's transgressions, taken in isolation, shouldn't have been singled out by busy prosecutors. Indeed, the hush money trial and its connection to campaign events was a shabby way to begin criminally prosecting a former president. It centered on a bookkeeping issue. Uncharged campaign and tax violations. Low comedy. It was not the kind of democracy-rattling drama it should take to put a president in prison.\nYet there is a democracy-rattling drama pending, and the greatest shame of the hush money case it that it has distracted attention from it. Trump is accused of attempting to overthrow an election with fraud claims found bogus in 60 court cases, some in front of judges he appointed. Worse, he is accused of hurling an angry mob at the Capitol of the United States. These charges have yet to get near trial.\nThe Justice Department should have leaped into action on these claims, yet it crawled. The major federal cases should have been brought, tried, and over long before the eve of a presidential election. Yet the major federal case is cooling its heels waiting while the Supreme Court issues other opinions but does not rule on whether the president is immune from criminal prosecution. These delays should cease, and the key cases should be tried. The cartoon is over. It's time for the drama to begin.\nThomas G. Moukawsher is a former Connecticut complex litigation judge and a former co-chair of the American Bar Association Committee on Employee Benefits. He is the author of the new book,The Common Flaw: Needless Complexity in the Courts and 50 Ways to Reduce It.\nThe views expressed in this article are the writer's own.\n",

    "content": "When interviewing potential hires, asking the right questions is key to finding the right candidate for your company. These lines of questioning can reveal a lot about a candidate's skills, personality and fit for your team.\nTo help you get the most out of your interviews, the members of Newsweek Expert Forum discuss their favorite questions to ask applicants. Here are 17 questions they recommend asking, along with what the responses can uncover and why they are so effective in evaluating candidates.\nAsk about their most and least favorite part of their job. This question gives great insight into what aspects of the work they find engaging and what disinterests them. If you listen and probe about how they tackle the least favorite aspects, there is so much that can be learned, including a sense of working style preference, if the job offered matches their interests and how they prioritize their work. - Michelle Tillis Lederman, Author, The Connector's Advantage\nI frequently ask potential hires to discuss a major mistake that they have made in the past and what they do differently now as a result of having made that mistake. How they answer such a question can provide a tremendous amount of insight not only into their problem-solving skills and ability to learn from mistakes but also into their willingness to accept responsibility for bad decisions. - Joseph Steinberg, CyberSecurity and Artificial Intelligence Expert Services\nThere are several, but one I like is to ask people what their goals are in life, how they plan to achieve them, what their limitations and strengths are and if they are confident about hitting those goals. That will tell me a lot about how a person thinks and will behave. - Zain Jaffer, Zain Ventures\nAsk candidates whether they are willing to work overtime, weekends and holidays if needed. I ask this because this speaks volumes to me during those times and their response is vital to me when hiring. It proves they are not only serious but will also be a dedicated employee. - Tammy Sons, Tn Nursery\nI like to ask about one lesson they've had to learn again and again. This question probes into a potential hire's capacity for self-reflection, adaptability and growth. It also gauges their capacity for honesty, humility and authentic communication while unveiling their ability to recognize patterns, learn from mistakes and showcase a commitment to ongoing personal and professional development. - Anna Yusim, MD, Yusim Psychiatry, Consulting & Executive Coaching\nAsk what is the most significant risk they have taken as a professional and what they learned from it. This question not only reveals their capacity for taking risks but also denotes their learning agility and resilience. Any response they give can denote their willingness to step out of their comfort zones. - Dr. Kira Graves, Kira Graves Consulting\nInterview questions for potential hires are designed to uncover facts and nuances about backgrounds, interests, experiences, preparation and commitment to an opportunity. One of the most revealing interview questions probes a person's failures and lessons learned. Candidates who respond with clarity demonstrate self-awareness and resilience, which are necessary for handling complex challenges. - Lillian Gregory, The 4D Unicorn LLC\nMy favorite question is asking where do they see themselves in five years. In asking this, I am looking for the prospective employee to tell me they expect to still be with our firm. It may seem trite, but identifying long-term team members is a critical part of our interview process. Who can grow with us as a firm? Who wants to make their career with us? - Jacob Kupietzky, HCT Executive Interim Management & Consulting\nI like asking about their least favorite job duties. Many candidates want to please interviewers and say they like everything. On the other hand, top professionals know exactly what they don't want to do in their next role. - Krisztina Veres, Veres Career Consulting\n\"What is the constructive feedback that you received in your most recent performance review? Why do you think you received this feedback? What have you done about it since?\" These questions at the surface level are telling, and so are the behavioral insights gleaned from the way the candidate answers the question. For example, it can demonstrate whether the candidate is self-aware and if they practice self-improvement. - Sabina Pons, Growth Molecules\nI ask about what they are in the middle of doing that they're excited about. This open-ended question surfaces what potential hires are passionate about, as well as the correlation between their strengths and the outcomes they are positioned to deliver as a result. The more aligned a candidate's strengths and passions are with the role, the better the likelihood of fit. - Karen Mangia, The Engineered Innovation Group\nI ask candidates to describe their ideal working environment specifically and in a bottom-lined manner. I also ask what that does for them when they have that environment. - Jay Steven Levin, WinThinking\n\"If you were suddenly elevated to the CEO position in your prior role, what would be the three to four pillars of your strategy? Why those pillars? And how would you go about implementing them?\" This is a challenging question that requires time for reflection but it provides exceptional insights about a leader's strategic thinking and their ability to translate their strategy into action. - Eric Michrowski, Propulo Consulting\nI have candidates describe a challenge they faced in their previous role, how they addressed it and what they learned from the experience. The question provides critical insights into problem-solving orientation, professional maturity, learning orientation, collaborative spirit or leadership and emotional intelligence. - Britton Bloch, Navy Federal\nAsk candidates to talk about a time when they felt overwhelmed with their workload or experienced burnout. Learn how they recognized it and what steps they took to address it. Additionally, what boundaries or self-care practices did they implement to prevent burnout and maintain their well-being in high-pressure situations? - Leah Marone, Corporate Wellness Consultant\n\"What major change have you made that has positively impacted your professional life?\" I like this question because it uncovers a candidate's approach to growth and challenges. It shows their self-awareness, willingness to evolve and adaptability, which are all essential qualities for any role. Additionally, their answer provides insight into what unique contributions they can bring to the team. - Gergo Vari, Lensa\nOne of my favorite questions to ask potential hires in an interview is, \"Can you tell me about a time when you faced a challenging situation at work and how you handled it?\" This question allows me to assess their problem-solving skills, resilience and ability to handle pressure. Their answer would tell me if they can think critically, adapt to difficult circumstances and take initiative. - Alan Wozniak, Business Health Matters (BHM) Executive Consulting\n",

    "publishedAt": "8:30 AM EDT, Sun May 12, 2024",
    "content": "A month after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the historian Yuval Noah Harari made a bold claim that seemed delusional.\nHarari made his claim in an essay on the heroism of the Ukrainian people. He praised embattled Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, who refused to flee his country when death seemed certain, telling his would-be rescuers that he needed ammunition, not a ride. He marveled at the outnumbered Ukrainian soldiers on Snake Island who told a Russian warship to “go f**k yourself,” and the civilians blocking Russian tanks with their bodies.\n“Nations are ultimately built on stories,” said Harari, author of “Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind.” “Each passing day adds more stories that Ukrainians will not only tell in the dark days ahead, but in the decades and generations to come … This is the stuff nations are built from. In the long run, these stories count for more than tanks.”\nBut there’s another type of story that’s gained traction in the US — the kind that can cause a nation to unravel. The new hit movie, “Civil War,” which has earned more than $100 million worldwide at the box office, is the latest example of a disturbing trend: We no longer seem to know how to tell well-crafted stories that counter those that depict American democracy as doomed.\nIn “Civil War,” tanks trample democracy. The film depicts a near-future America that has been torn apart by seceding regions and militia violence. It features a fascist leader in the White House, an attempted coup and Americans casually killing one another in the streets. One critic called it writer-director Alex Garland’s “very in-your-face attempt to imagine the unimaginable in America.”\nIt’s hard to imagine any other future for the United States when you consider the popularity of movies like “Civil War.” Most of the stories about the state of America that gain traction in popular culture are the ones that end in its failure. They’re the opposite of the hopeful, unifying stories any country needs to overcome tough times.\n“Civil War” is part of a growing entertainment genre that, to borrow a phrase from former President Donald Trump, could be called “American carnage.” Dystopian movies and TV shows like “The Walking Dead,” “The Purge,” “The Hunger Games,” “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “The Last of Us” all imagine a hellish future in America triggered by an environmental, political or civic collapse.\nThere’s nothing wrong with dystopian thrillers. They serve as cautionary tales and are as old as the book of Revelation. But the messages they send may be more dangerous than the violence depicted onscreen: The collapse of democracy is inevitable. Americans can never transcend their tribalism. Resistance is futile.\nThere’s something wrong when we churn out stories about superheroes in spandex banding together from different galaxies to save the universe, but we can’t tell a popular story that shows Americans coming together to save our country.\nIt didn’t used to be this way. There was another time when democracy in America was under threat, and filmmakers responded by making stirring movies aimed at lifting Americans’ spirit and equipping them for the battles ahead.\nConsider “Casablanca,” the classic 1942 film. It proves that you can tell a gripping story about patriotism without being sappy or boring. In the film, Humphrey Bogart plays Rick, the cynical owner of a Moroccan nightclub at the onset of World War II. The movie is remembered today for its classic lines (“Here’s looking at you kid”; “We’ll always have Paris”; “Round up the usual suspects”).\nYet there’s another classic line uttered by Rick — “I stick my neck out for nobody” — that hints at deeper reasons why “Casablanca” was made. The film is set before Pearl Harbor, when many Americans didn’t want to get involved in a European conflict. Adolf Hitler’s Nazi war machine seemed unstoppable. Fascism was on a global march. Democracy’s future seemed grim.\nRick responds to the impending crisis with apathy and cynicism. But when his old flame, played by actress Ingrid Bergman, walks into his club one night, she not only rekindles their romance but his idealism.\n“The movie was a patriotic rallying cry that affirmed a sense of national purpose,” wrote Cristóbal S. Berry-Cabán in an essay. “The film emphasized group effort and the value of individual sacrifices for a larger cause. It portrayed World War II as a peoples’ war, typically featuring a diverse group of people and ethnic backgrounds who are thrown together, tested, and molded into a dedicated (force) fighting fascism.”\nOther films of that era made similar storytelling choices. Legendary Hollywood director Frank Capra made a series of seven patriotic films during World War II called “Why We Fight” that rallied Americans in the fight against fascism.\nThe entertainer Frank Sinatra, a paragon of mid-20th century American masculinity, starred in a short film called “The House We Live In.” It would be labeled “woke” today. In the film, Sinatra intervenes when he sees a group of youths chasing a Jewish boy. He tells them that “religion makes no difference, except to a Nazi or someone who’s stupid.” The film was eventually selected by the Library of Congress as being “culturally and historically” significant.\nSinatra would later record a song with the same title as the film, which he would perform throughout his career. It included lines like, “The faces that I see. All races and religions. That’s America to me.”\nOther World War II-era films like “Don’t be a Sucker,” which emphasized racial and religious tolerance in America, emphasized the same message. It went viral after the 2017 neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\nThose black-and-white films may seem dated and idealistic in an America that has been through the Vietnam War, Watergate, 9/11 and January 6. But a country needs a unifying story like a human being needs oxygen.\n“Stories are essential to holding a nation together,” says Kermit Roosevelt III, a historian and author of “The Nation That Never Was: Reconstructing America’s Story.” “You have to have something that motivates people to make sacrifices for the nation. If you’re going to fight a war, you have to have people who are willing to lay down their lives. But we more often call on people to make sacrifices for others, to bear burdens, promote justice and help out the less fortunate.”\nThat doesn’t mean we return to the days of making clumsy propaganda films. But Roosevelt says we should keep in mind that most stories contain some elements of propaganda.\n“We have this idea that propaganda is bad or ideology is bad,” Roosevelt says. “But I think that history and education are inherently ideological, and there’s a perspective there and you’re trying to impart lessons.”\nSome of America’s most gifted political leaders knew that lesson well. Two of the most consequential presidents in recent memory — Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama — were master storytellers. They told stories that made Americans believe in democracy, in one another and in their country’s future.\nReagan’s skills were on display when he told a story about American vitality in his farewell speech that echoed Sinatra’s “The House We Live In.” He said the source of America’s greatness was immigrants.\n“While other countries cling to the stale past, here in America we breathe life into dreams,” Reagan said. “Thanks to each wave of new arrivals to this land of opportunity, we’re a nation forever young, forever bursting with energy and new ideas, and always on the cutting edge, always leading the world to the world to the next frontier. This quality is vital to our future as a nation.”\nFormer President Obama cited his personal story as a reason to believe in America, despite the country’s history of not living up to its ideals. The son of a White mother from Kansas and a Black father from Kenya, Obama said his journey to national prominence was proof that the American dream was possible.\n“I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on Earth is my story even possible,” he during his speech at the  2004 Democratic National Convention, which would eventually catapult him to the White House.\nIt’s easy to dismiss Reagan’s and Obama’s storytelling as the product of clever speechwriters. What candidate doesn’t call America great, or vow that anything is possible in the land of the free and home of the brave?\nBut the dominant American political figure of recent years does not typically tell such unifying stories about his country. Former President Trump coined the term “American carnage” during his 2017 inaugural address. He routinely describes an America that more resembles the failed state depicted in the “Civil War” movie, with his declaration in January that “We are a nation in decline, we are a failing nation.”\nTelling that kind of story hasn’t appeared to hurt Trump any more than it hurt the makers of “Civil War.” And, truth be told, stories of American greatness can ring hollow to the descendants of enslaved Americans, the Japanese Americans interned during World War II and those dismayed today by politicians and judges who disregard democratic norms.\nHow can we tell a story today that doesn’t ignore the brutality of American history but still inspires hope for the future?\nThere’s another figure from the past who may help us.\nWalt Whitman, the 19th century writer dubbed “the poet of democracy,” said that America was his greatest poem. Through poetry, Whitman did what so many seem incapable of today — he made a multiracial, multireligious democracy in America visceral and exciting, not a civics lesson.\nIn “Songs of Myself,” Whitman vividly described America as “the Nation of many nations,” and said of himself and his country,” “Of every hue and caste am I, of every rank and religion.”\nRead Whitman today and one is struck by his expansive definition of what it means to be an American. No one is excluded — he treats the “boatman and clam-diggers, the farmer, the deacon, the runaway slave, the prostitute and the president with equal reverence, “For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.”\nThe historian Ian Beacock said Whitman offers an answer for those who wonder how they can defend democracy against stories that predict its demise. He suggests they take Whitman’s approach: “State an emotional case for democracy that appeals as much to those who already possess power as to those yet without it.”\nIt starts with being honest about the appeal of other modes of government, like fascism, he says.\n“It’s obvious that being free and equal is better than being dominated,” Beacock wrote.” But is it better than dominating? Exerting power over others is a seductive feeling, too, if a dark and dangerous one.”\nMany democracies simply “unravel” because their citizens get complacent, Beacock says. Democracy is hard to sustain because of its constant demands for compromise. People often go shopping for alternatives that seem like less work, he says.\nWhitman told stories about democracy that engaged people’s feelings, not just their intellect, Beacock says.\n“This is perhaps Whitman’s core contribution to democratic thought and practice: the reminder that democracy’s defenders mustn’t neglect political feelings (“Logic and sermons never convince”) and that self-government must appeal to the human heart if it is to last long. “\nThe Austrian philosopher Ivan Illich was once asked about the most revolutionary way to change a society. He said:\n“Neither revolution nor reformation can ultimately change a society, rather you must tell a new powerful tale, one so persuasive that it sweeps away the old myths and becomes the preferred story, one so inclusive that it gathers all the bits of our past and our present into a coherent whole, one that even shines some light into our future so that we can take the next step…”\nHow Americans in 2024 decide to tell their national story is up for debate. What shouldn’t be up for discussion, though, is the need for such stories. Isn’t it time we tell a new story of a future America where the White House isn’t going up in flames and citizens aren’t murdering one another?\nThe box office success of “Civil War” ensures, though, that more “American carnage” stories are likely headed our way. Though the film doesn’t take any political sides, it amplifies the same message that autocrats in Russia and China are making through their propaganda: America is hopelessly divided and degenerate, and democracy is doomed.\nMaybe it’s time to rediscover what Americans of another era knew. Those old black-and-white films about what makes America special may seem corny now. But they understood that you must defend democracy not only with tanks, but with stirring tales that reverberate for generations to come.\nIf you believe democracy is under threat in America, find a “new powerful tale” that inspires us to believe it has a future.\nBut don’t dispense platitudes or give us a civics lesson.\nTell us a story.\nJohn Blake is a Senior Writer at CNN and the author of “More Than I Imagined: What a Black Man Discovered About the White Mother He Never Knew.”\n",

    "content": "A video of President Joe Biden supposedly \"wandering\" from leaders at the Group of Seven (G7) summit Thursday has gone viral on social media, although some users have pointed out that the 30-second clip lacks context.\nThe video appears to have first been shared to X, formerly Twitter, by the account RNC Research, which is managed by former President Donald Trump's campaign and the Republican National Committee.\nIn the clip, Biden and the other G7 leaders are seen applauding a skydiving demonstration when the president turns to his left and walks toward a man packing up a parachute, and away from the gathering of world officials. It is not clear what Biden said to the man but he is seen giving him a thumbs-up before Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni taps the president on the shoulder and gestures for him to return to the group, where they appear to pause for a photo opportunity.\nSeveral Republicans have shared the video on social media and used it to express concerns over Biden's mental capacity. Critics of the president, who turns 82 in November, have repeatedly claimed that he is too old or infirm to serve another term.\nBiden is the presumptive Democratic nominee for the November presidential election, poised for a likely rematch with Trump, who turns 78 on Friday. The former president has also elicited worries from some regarding his own mental acuity.\n\"WHAT IS BIDEN DOING?\" the RNC Research account wrote in its post to X, which as of 4:25 p.m. EST had been viewed over 1.2 million times.\nConservative commentator Collin Rugg also shared RNC Research's video clip to his X account, writing in the post, \"President Biden appears to start wandering off at the G7 summit and has to be handled back in.\"\n\"Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni was seen grabbing Biden to bring him back to the group ... Clown show,\" Rugg said.\nMedia personality Clay Travis, a longtime Trump supporter, also reshared the video and wrote on X, \"Joe Biden just goes wandering off at the G7 meeting. Another national leader has to retrieve him. They are babysitting our president in Italy.\"\nNewsweek sent an email to the White House press office for comment on Thursday.\nA few X users spoke up in defense of the president, including online personality Brian Krassenstein, who called the video \"another attack without context.\"\n\"As you can see at the 4 second mark, 8 of the 10 world leaders, including Biden are looking towards the man on the right packing the parachute,\" Krassenstein wrote on X. \"Biden began saying something to him as the others had their attention shifted in the other direction because another man began talking to the group suddenly.\"\n\"Once again, focusing on an edited-down 30-second clip doesn't tell a full story,\" he added. \"Stop being disingenuous.\"\nLast week, a video of Biden at a D-Day anniversary event in Normandy, France, went viral after, critics said, it appeared to show that the president was attempting to sit in a chair that didn't exist. As the Associated Press later reported, however, a full clip of the moment shows that Biden looked over his shoulder for his chair and paused before taking a seat.\nUpdate 06/13/24, 9:48 p.m. ET: The headline of this article has been updated to include additional context.\n",

No injuries were reported.\nIn a post on social platform Weibo Tuesday, the China Coast Guard said it had expelled the Philippine vessels for “intruding” into the waters, “in accordance with the law.”\nBeijing asserts ownership over almost all of the South China Sea in defiance of an international court ruling. Over the past two decades, China has occupied a number of obscure reefs and atolls far from its shoreline across the South China Sea, building up military installations, including runways and ports.\nRelated article\nWhat it’s like on board an outnumbered Philippine ship facing down China’s push to dominate the South China Sea\nScarborough Shoal, which China calls Huangyan Island and is also known as Bajo de Masinloc, is a small but strategic reef and fertile fishing ground.\nThere are no structures on the shoal, but China has maintained a continuous coast guard presence around it since 2012, according to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative.\nThe Philippines also said Tuesday that China had reinstalled a 380-meter (1,247-feet) floating barrier that “covers the entire entrance of the shoal, effectively restricting access to the area.”\nScarborough Shoal is one of several disputed islands and reefs in the South China Sea, which have long been a flashpoint of territorial disputes between the two nations.\nIn March, Chinese coast guard ships fired water cannons against a Philippine vessel on a resupply mission to a contingent of Filipino marines on another contested South China Sea feature, Second Thomas Shoal, causing “heavy damages.”\nThat shoal sits about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the coast of the Philippine island of Palawan. In the 1990s the Philippines grounded an aging World War II-era transport ship called the BRP Sierra Madre on the shoal, to help enforce its claim to the area. The ship is now mostly a rusted wreckage and is staffed by marines stationed on rotation.\nFollowing that incident, the China Coast Guard said on Weibo it had taken “control measures in accordance with the law” against the Philippine vessels, which it said had “illegally entered the waters adjacent to Ren’ai Reef,” as Beijing calls Second Thomas Shoal.\nEarlier in March, Chinese water cannon hit a Philippine resupply boat as it headed to Second Thomas Shoal, shattering windows and injuring four Filipino sailors.\nBeijing and Manila’s South China Sea disputes have heated up since the 2022 election of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who has taken a stronger line against China than his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte.\nThe clashes have also raised fears they could lead to a wider conflict, as Manila maintains a mutual defense treaty with the United States, which Washington says covers Philippine vessels in the disputed waterway.\n",

    "content": "Ghost Shark and Manta Ray protect the undersea realm. Sounds like the plot of a future Marvel movie, but in actual fact, it’s what could be the future of Pacific naval defenses.\nGhost Shark and Manta Ray are the names of prototype uncrewed underwater vehicles – UUVs or drones – introduced recently by Australia and the United States respectively.\nExperts say the submersibles could represent the future of undersea warfare, showing the ability to exert power while minimizing the danger to human life.\nThe use of drones in aerial warfare has become commonplace. The US used them extensively during conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan beginning in the 1990s, and newer, cheaper drones have become key pieces of military hardware for both sides in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nKyiv has also built naval surface drones, which have inflicted heavy losses on the much larger and more expensive ships of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet.\nAerial and surface sea drones can be controlled using satellites and light and radio waves. But those don’t function in the same way in the depths.\nA 2023 study published in the Swiss journal Sensors points out that underwater communications require more energy but still see significant data loss to variables including water temperature, salinity and depth.\nMakers of the new generation of military UUVs aren’t saying how they would overcome communications problems.\nBut when Australia unveiled Ghost Shark last month, it called the prototypes “the most advanced undersea autonomous vehicles in the world.”\n“Ghost Shark will provide Navy with a stealthy, long-range autonomous undersea warfare capability that can conduct persistent intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR) and strike,” a statement from the Australian Defense Ministry said, adding that it expects the first production models to be delivered by the end of next year.\nAustralian officials and those from manufacturer Anduril Australia said they could not share any of the specs on Ghost Shark as those remain classified.\nBut they touted the speed with which the submersible has gone from idea to testing, with the program having started just two years ago.\n“Being ahead of schedule, on budget, it’s pretty unheard of,” Shane Arnott, Anduril’s senior vice president for engineering, told reporters.\n“Delivering the first Ghost Shark prototype ahead of schedule sets a new standard for capability development at the speed of need,” Australia’s chief defense scientist, Tanya Monro, said in a statement.\nEmma Salisbury, a fellow at the British think tank Council on Geostrategy, said the Ghost Shark seems much like the Orca extra-large UUV being developed in the US.\nRelated article\nA Ukrainian pilot outlines how drones powered by jet skis sunk a Russian warship\n“I assume that they are all intended for roughly similar mission sets – persistent intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and strike capability, particularly in the anti-submarine domain,” Salisbury said.\nThe US Navy called the Boeing-built Orca UUV “a cutting-edge, autonomous, unmanned diesel-electric submarine with a modular payload section to execute a variety of missions” in a December news release on the delivery of a first Orca test platform, an early prototype.\nHaving a modular payload means the Orca in theory could carry different weapons varieties depending upon the task or be fitted with specialized equipment for reconnaissance or possibly intelligence gathering.\nThe release said the Pentagon would acquire five more of the UUVs, without giving a timetable. But the US Orca has been in the works for more than a decade, the Navy release said, a sharp contrast to the speed with which Australia has developed Ghost Shark.\nChris Brose, Anduril’s chief strategy officer, said the company and Australia are in the “process of proving” that “these kinds of capabilities can be built much faster, much cheaper, much more intelligently.”\nAnduril Australia said the entirely domestically developed Ghost Shark would be made available for export after it joins the Australian naval fleet.\nMeanwhile, back across the Pacific, the Orca isn’t the only UUV being developed in the US.\nAmerica’s latest UUV entry is Northrop Grumman’s Manta Ray, a prototype of which was tested off Southern California in February and March.\nThe Defense Advanced Research Products Agency (DARPA), the Pentagon branch in charge of developing new technologies, says Manta Ray’s strength is in its modularity, the ability to switch out payloads depending on the mission.\nIt can be broken down and fit into five standard shipping containers, move to where it’s going to be deployed, and reassembled in the field, according to Northrop Grumman.\nThe prototype was built in Maryland and then reassembled on the California coast.\n“The combination of cross-country modular transportation, in-field assembly, and subsequent deployment demonstrates a first-of-kind capability for an extra-large UUV,” Kyle Woerner, who heads the Manta Ray program at DARPA, said in an agency news release.\nHe also noted the modular transport method means the Manta Ray can save internal energy for its mission, rather than using it to get to the deployment site.\nLike the Orca, the Manta Ray hasn’t come together as quickly as Ghost Shark. Its program began in 2020 and DARPA didn’t give a goal for the Manta Ray – or some variant of it – to join the US fleet.\nRelated article\nA Houthi missile was just seconds from hitting a US warship. The Navy used its ‘last line of defense’\n“DARPA is engaging with the U.S. Navy on the next steps for testing and transition of this technology,” the agency’s release said.\nMeanwhile, China, named by the US military as its “pacing threat” in the Pacific, is also making advances in UUVs, Salisbury said.\n“While details are scarce, as with most Chinese capabilities, they have been developing them for at least 15 years and likely now have something similar to the Orca (but with torpedoes) in the testing phase,” she said.\nSubmarine expert H I Sutton says on his Covert Shores website that, according to an analysis of open-source intelligence, Beijing is believed to have at least six extra-large UUVs under development.\nBesides Australia, the US and China, other countries working on UUVs include Canada, France, India, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Norway, Russia, South Korea, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, according to Sutton.\n",

    "content": "France could send instructors to Ukraine to train its military in a matter of days, according to reports.\nThe development was reported Thursday by French newspaper Le Monde, citing sources familiar with the matter. This came days after Ukraine's top commander, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, said he had signed paperwork permitting France to send military instructors to his country to train Ukrainian forces \"and familiarize themselves with their infrastructure and personnel.\"\nFrance, alongside Ukraine's other NATO allies, has trained more than 100,000 troops since Russia's full-scale invasion began in February 2022, doing so within the European Union. Shortly after Syrskyi's announcement, Ukraine's Defense Ministry issued a \"clarification\" saying Kyiv was \"still in discussions with France and other countries on this.\"\nAccording to Le Monde's sources, Ukraine was forced to tone down its comments on the possible deployment of French instructors to the war-torn country. Discussions on the matter should accelerate in the coming days, they said, and an announcement could be made during Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to France next week.\nFrance would initially send a few dozen personnel \"in order to identify training needs\" before deploying several hundred more, the sources said.\nReuters also reported Thursday that France could soon send military trainers to Ukraine, citing three diplomatic sources who said the training would focus on demining, ensuring that equipment stays operational and technical expertise for warplanes, to be provided by Ukraine's Western allies.\n\"The arrangements are very advanced, and we could expect something next week,\" one source said.\nNewsweek couldn't independently verify the reports on French military trainers and has contacted Russia's Foreign Ministry for comment by email.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron doubled down in March on the possibility of sending ground troops into Ukraine. In late February, he suggested that NATO members could send in such troops, saying, \"We cannot exclude options\" because \"the security of Europe and the security of the French people is at stake here.\"\nMacron has said there are \"no limits\" to France's support for Kyiv.\nOther NATO members, including the U.S. and Germany, have ruled out sending ground troops to Ukraine. In March, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said President Joe Biden has \"made it clear that we will not put U.S. boots on the ground.\"\nRussian President Vladimir Putin warned in February that \"Russia won't let anyone interfere in its internal affairs\" and that his country's \"strategic nuclear forces are in a state of full readiness.\"\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters on May 8 that French troops will be targeted by Russian forces if they \"appear in the conflict zone [in Ukraine].\"\n",

Daniels is also said to have urged Davidson to settle the negotiations for the hush money quickly over fears she would lose leverage if Trump lost the election.\nEliason said on X that the attempts by Trump's legal team to suggest Daniels wanted the payment before the 2016 election to maintain leverage over Trump could also help the prosecution set out to the jury why the former president wanted to pay it.\n\"The defense bringing out that Daniels would lose all 'leverage' if the story wasn't purchased before the election is supposed to make it sound like extortion,\" Eliason wrote. \"But it actually helps the prosecution: the story had value to Trump only [because] of its ability to influence the election.\"\nExpanding on his remarks, Eliason told Newsweek: \"Everyone involved recognized that suppressing the story only had value to Trump prior to the election; after that he wouldn't care and wouldn't pay.\n\"The purpose of the hush money was not to avoid public embarrassment or keep the story from Melania—which could be done at any time—it was to influence the election. That is the prosecution's primary theory of the case, and the defense cross of Davidson helped reinforce it.\"\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in relation to $130,000 he arranged for Cohen to pay Daniels to keep an alleged affair she had with Trump secret in the run-up to the 2016 election, which was later listed in company records as Cohen's \"legal fees.\" Prosecutors suggested the payment was part of an unlawful attempt to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential race.\nNewsweek has contacted Donald Trump's legal team for comment via email.\nGeorge Grasso, a former judge at the New York City Criminal Court in Kings County, said Davidson \"produced some fireworks\" during his testimony, with Bove also conducting a \"fiery\" cross-examination.\n\"All told, while the witness had to endure some uncomfortable moments, his testimony appeared to hold together regarding his key role in facilitating the 'hush money' payments at the heart of the People's case,\" Grasso told Newsweek.\nTrump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, said he reimbursed the $130,000 payment to Cohen but denied having an affair with Daniels.\nIn April 2023, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office released a statement of facts about its investigation that said Trump instructed Cohen to delay paying Daniels the $130,000 sum for \"as long as possible\" in the hope that after the 2016 election they could \"avoid paying altogether, because at that point it would not matter if the story became public.\"\nElsewhere during Thursday's proceedings, Bove suggested Davidson approached breaking the law when he sought money from celebrities to stop potentially embarrassing stories about them from becoming public, including an alleged attempt to seek cash from wrestler Hulk Hogan in exchange for a sex tape.\n\"You were pretty well-versed in getting right up to the line without committing extortion, right?\" Bove asked.\nDavidson denied ever committing extortion, saying the settlements he reached with public figures were fair and legitimate.\nUpdate 5/3/24, 10:53 a.m. ET: This article has been updated with further comment from Randall Eliason.\n",

We're standing together against this illegal aggression,\" Biden said. President Vladimir Putin of Russia \"cannot wait us out,\" Biden added. \"He cannot divide us. We will be with Ukraine until they prevail.\"\nZelensky called the security agreement \"historic\" in remarks alongside Biden after both leaders formally signed the pact.\n\"We have signed the strongest agreement with Ukraine and the U.S since our independence,\" Zelensky said. \"It clearly states America's efforts to help Ukraine win this war.\"\nThe agreement commits the U.S. to provide Ukraine with continued military training, defense and intelligence cooperation and other security assistance.\nUnder the deal the U.S. will \"support the full range of Ukraine's current defensive needs now and over the long-term,\" according to a White House memo on the agreement.\nThe pact does not include a commitment by the U.S. to send American troops to Ukraine in the event of a future attack.\nBiden has said since Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022 that he would not send U.S. troops to Ukraine. Zelensky has not asked for foreign troops, saying that Ukraine can defend itself if it continues receiving weapons and other military aid from its allies.\nZelensky has also pushed for Ukraine to join NATO, whose members are committed to defend each other if a country in the alliance is attacked. The U.S. and other allies have expressed support for Ukraine's eventual ascension to NATO while also signaling that it's unlikely until the war with Russia is over.\nThe White House memo called the deal \"a key part of Ukraine's bridge to NATO membership.\"\n\"Ukraine's future is in NATO,\" the memo said.\nA debate about the timeline for Ukraine's membership will be front and center at this year's NATO summit, which takes place next month in Washington, D.C.\nAdministration officials said the security deal was a significant step in bolstering ties between the U.S. and Ukraine, despite the fact that it falls short of a NATO-style mutual defense pact.\nThe agreement is a \"real marker of our commitment, not just for this month, this year, but for many years ahead, to continue to support Ukraine, both in defending against Russian aggression and in deterring future aggression,\" National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Thursday ahead of the press conference and signing ceremony.\nThe deal is legally binding. But it can be reversed by a future president, since it is not a treaty that requires ratification by Congress.\nSpeculation about whether Donald Trump would undo the agreement if he wins the 2024 election began even before the deal was signed Thursday at the summit in Italy.\nAs a candidate Trump has sent mixed signals on Ukraine. He did not stand in the way of Republicans supporting a major security package for Ukraine that Congress approved earlier this year after a lengthy delay.\nStill, Trump has expressed concern at times about continued U.S. spending on Ukraine. He also said that he would end the war in one day as president, though he didn't say how.\nDuring his presidency Trump withdrew from the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal.\nBiden and Zelensky did not focus on Trump or what he might do during their joint appearance Thursday in Italy.\nThe meeting between Biden and Zelensky comes one week after the leaders met in France on the sidelines of the 80th anniversary commemoration of D-Day.\nBiden is scheduled to meet Friday with Italian Prime Minister Georgia Meloni and other G7 leaders as well as Pope Franics before flying back to the U.S.\n",

Many homeowners who locked in rates when they were sitting at 2-3 percent for years are reluctant to list their homes and be forced to take a new loan at 7 percent, which is where rates for a 30-year-fixed mortgage have been hovering for months.\nThat's exacerbated a major affordability crisis in the housing market, particularly for first-time buyers. While there are some signs that listings have increased in recent weeks as spring kicked into gear—and the average 30-year-fixed rate has eased a bit from recent highs—there are few indications that prices are set to significantly cool anytime soon, especially as the Federal Reserve has pumped the brakes on any plans to cut interest rates in the immediate future.\nRead more: How to Get a Mortgage\nAccording to the Case-Shiller data broken down by metro area, San Diego posted the biggest gains among the 20 largest U.S. cities measured. Home prices in the southern California city were up more than 11 percent year-over-year, followed closely by New York, Cleveland and Los Angeles. Prices in the 20-city index were up 7.4 percent on an annual basis, slightly above the 7.3 percent gain a month earlier and evidence that demand for homes in urban areas — where inventory remains especially tight — remains strong.\nOn a month-over-month basis, the 0.3 percent rise in March was less than the 0.6 percent rise in February.\nThe Northeast region was the \"top performer\" with an 8.3 percent annual rise in prices, said Brian D. Luke, head of commodities, real and digital assets at S&P Dow Jones Indices, in a press release. \"COVID was a boom for Sunbelt markets, but the bigger gains the last couple of years have been the northern metro cities.\"\nRead more: How to Buy a House With Bad Credit\nIt's the ninth time national home prices have hit a new high in the past year, Luke said, and all 20 of the biggest markets have now seen price gains for four months straight.\nIn a sign of just how competitive the Northeast market remains even in the face of high rates, a 1,000-square-foot, 2-bedroom, 1-bathroom fixer-upper in Bergen County, N.J., outside of New York City, received 79 offers when it was listed for $398,000 in late March.

    "content": "Xi Jinping may have started his recent European trip by fielding tough questions in France about trade and Russia’s war in Ukraine, but the Chinese leader ended the sojourn late last week by projecting a stark message: that despite frictions with much of the continent, China still has fans in some European capitals.\nBeijing’s pulling power was on show in Belgrade and Budapest, where streets were festooned with Chinese flags. As Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan touched down at both cities’ airports, folk dancers performed on the tarmac and, in contrast to the subdued welcome the couple received in Paris, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban were on hand to greet them.\nChinese state media played up the warm diplomacy, with headlines proclaiming China’s “ironclad” bond with Serbia and “golden friendship” with Hungary. Both countries, major recipients of Chinese investment, announced upgrades of their relations with China during the visits – a symbolic win for Xi that analysts say could play a role softening European policy on China in fraught areas such as trade, security and human rights.\nBut in the rest of Europe, the red-carpet welcome afforded Xi by Vucic and Orban – both widely seen as illiberal and Russia-friendly – may not play as well, analysts say, and emphasizes the shrinking number of European capitals where Xi would meet such a warm embrace.\nChina-Europe relations have been frayed by the European Union’s growing list of economic grievances with China, which could yet spiral into a full-blown trade war. Also in the mix are suspicions across Europe about Beijing’s global ambitions and influence, especially over its support for Russia – including allegations it is supplying dual-use parts which help the Kremlin’s war against Ukraine.\nMaking his first visit to Europe in five years, Xi was pressed on these issues early last week by French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Both are sure to closely watch any summit between Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin in China, expected to happen soon.\nIn Paris, Xi stressed that China was playing no role other than “contributing to reaching peace” in Ukraine, and denied there was industrial “overcapacity” in China flooding the European market.\nSuch tensions vanished when Xi met Vucic and Orban.\nHis visits to Serbia and Hungary “send a very good message to a Chinese (domestic) audience that ‘we have close friends in Europe… Hungary and Serbia are real friends that we can do business with,’” said Philippe Le Corre, a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis, speaking at an event hosted by the center as Xi’s tour got underway last week.\nBut the countries’ inclusion in his itinerary was “embarrassing” for Paris, because both Orban and Vucic attended the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing last October alongside Putin, Le Corre added.\nXi’s visits to Serbia and Hungary helped him toward another goal – chipping away at a world order he sees as dominated by the United States.\nWith the inking of a joint statement, Serbia’s Vucic became the first European leader to commit to joining China in building a “community with a shared future.” The loosely formulated concept calls for a collaboration on shared interests, suggesting countries shouldn’t interact based on alliances, or be judged on their domestic politics and human rights record.\n“That is the highest level of cooperation of two countries and I am proud that as a president of Serbia I had an opportunity to sign that declaration with President Xi,” Vucic said Wednesday of the accord, which came alongside a free-trade agreement and other pledges from Xi on expanding agricultural imports and direct flights.\nXi also marketed a shared worldview during his meeting with Orban in Hungary, which is a member of both the EU and NATO. Orban, whose increasingly authoritarian rule has raised alarm within the EU, defied mounting concerns within both blocs to upgrade his country’s relations to an “all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership.”\nRelated card\nChina has a sweeping vision to reshape the world – and countries are listening\nAs well as being another symbolic win for Xi, this could encourage Orban to push back against efforts within the EU to “derisk” supply chains and slap tariffs on Chinese goods, analysts say. Speaking in Budapest Thursday alongside Orban, Xi appeared to allude to that, saying he hoped Hungary would use its rotating EU presidency beginning in July to “promote the stable and healthy development of China-EU relations.”\nThe two leaders also signed some 18 cooperation agreements, which Orban said covered sectors such as railways, IT, and nuclear energy. Xi declared the two countries would “deepen economic, trade, investment, and financial cooperation” and advance “key projects,” including the Budapest-Belgrade railway.\nBoth Serbia and Hungary are already key destinations for Chinese investment, with Hungary emerging as an increasingly important production hub in Europe for Chinese automotive suppliers including electric vehicle (EV) makers. In France earlier this week, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told journalists that Chinese company BYD was “welcome” to open a factory in France; but the EV giant appears to have already chosen its first foothold for car production in Europe, pledging late last year to open a plant in Hungary.\nBeijing may also be hoping other countries on the continent take note, with analysts saying all this plays into Xi’s efforts to frame parts of Europe as benefiting from clearheaded views on China, versus others who are mimicking American efforts to contain it.\n“Being close to these countries fits China’s domestic narrative that there are ‘smart countries’ in Europe who really understand China and do not support the United States – and China is working with these countries for the good of Europe,” said Liu Dongshu, an assistant professor of public and international affairs at Hong Kong’s City University.\nBut Xi’s itinerary also underscores his limitations within Europe, others say, including in Central and Eastern Europe where Beijing previously made extensive efforts to deepen connections and win goodwill, including through Xi’s flagship Belt and Road infrastructure drive.\nA Chinese mechanism to bolster relations with 16 Central and Eastern European nations has slowly lost support, in part because investments didn’t materialize at the expected scale, and also because China’s support for Russia soured relations in a region with a recent history of Soviet domination.\n“The unlimited partnership and Beijing’s moral and material support to Moscow has infuriated many (Central and Eastern European) countries’ leadership and population,” said Tamas Matura, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis. “This has definitely weakened China’s position in Europe.”\nRelated article\nIn Europe, Xi looks to counter claims China is aiding Russia in Ukraine\nMeanwhile, longstanding tensions with Nordic countries and Italy’s exit earlier this year from the Belt and Road, as well as recent visits to China by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, meant none of those countries were ideal for Xi to visit, Matura added. France, he said, was likely seen by Beijing as creating a potential for a diplomatic opening given its advocacy for Europe’s strategic autonomy from the US.\nBut there were few tangible signs from the trip that friction with Western European countries and the EU would abate, despite both Macron and Von der Leyen stressing the importance of dialogue and Xi’s two-day visit with the French president, which included a more personal trip to the Pyrenees and the signing of 18 cooperation deals.\nAnd despite their limited economic heft – with 16 million people between them, and a combined GDP about a tenth of France’s, according to IMF figures – Serbia and EU member Hungary may become increasingly valuable to Beijing as tensions with the bloc continue, and the threat of a trade war looms.\n“Orban and Vucic are both the kind of illiberal leaders who are positioning their countries between the rivaling geo-political blocs, hoping to avoid too strong dependence on any one of them,” said former Hungarian member of Parliament Gabor Scheiring, an assistant professor of comparative politics at Georgetown University in Qatar. “They don’t care about democracy or human rights. For them, foreign policy is strictly pragmatically about economic interests.”\nAnd that could be a boon for China.\n“Hungary and Serbia are strategic gateways for Beijing toward Europe…  the value of the two countries as gateways to Europe will increase as the trade war escalates,” he said.\nCNN’s Xiaofei Xu contributed to this report.\n",

    "content": "Five times the size of Paris. Visible from space. The world’s biggest energy plant. Enough electricity to power Switzerland.\nThe scale of the project transforming swathes of barren salt desert on the edge of western India into one of the most important sources of clean energy anywhere on the planet is so overwhelming that the man in charge can’t keep up.\n“I don’t even do the math any more,” Sagar Adani told CNN in an interview last week.\nAdani is executive director of Adani Green Energy Limited (AGEL). He’s also the nephew of Gautam Adani, Asia’s second richest man, whose $100 billion fortune stems from the Adani Group, India’s biggest coal importer and a leading miner of the dirty fuel. Founded in 1988, the conglomerate has businesses in fields ranging from ports and thermal power plants to media and cements.\nIts clean energy unit AGEL is building the sprawling solar and wind power plant in the western Indian state of Gujarat at a cost of about $20 billion. It will be the world’s biggest renewable park when it is finished in about five years, and should generate enough clean electricity to power 16 million Indian homes.\nThe success of the Khavda Renewable Energy Park is critical to India’s efforts to reduce pollution and hit its climate goals while meeting the burgeoning energy needs of the world’s most populous nation and fastest-growing major economy. Coal still accounts for 70% of the electricity India generates.\nSituated just 12 miles from one of the world’s most dangerous borders separating India and Pakistan, the park will cover more than 200 square miles and be the planet’s largest power plant regardless of the energy source, AGEL said.\n“A region so large, a region that is so unencumbered, there’s no wildlife, there’s no vegetation, there’s no habitation. There is no better alternative use of that land,” said Adani.\nThe group’s big green plans haven’t been dented by the turbulent year it has had since January 2023, when an American short-seller Hindenburg Research accused it of engaging in fraud over decades.\nThe Indian mining-to-media conglomerate denounced Hindenburg’s report as “baseless” and “malicious.” But that failed to halt a stunning stock market meltdown that, at one point, wiped more than $100 billion off the value of its listed companies. Gautam Adani’s personal fortune was also hammered, collapsing by more than $80 billion in the month following the release of the report.\nBut the tycoon has since bounced back and the group is now pouring billions into the clean energy sector.\nIt plans to invest $100 billion into energy transition over the next decade, with 70% of the investments ear-marked for clean energy.\nAdani Group’s clean energy pivot comes at a time when India has set itself some ambitious climate goals. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised that renewable sources such as solar and wind power will fulfil 50% of India’s energy requirements by the end of this decade.\nIn 2021, Modi pledged India would achieve net zero emissions by 2070, which is still a couple of decades later than developed economies.\nThe government has set a target of 500 gigawatts (GW) of non-fossil fuel electricity generating capacity by 2030. AGEL, the country’s largest renewable energy company, aims to provide at least 9% of that, with nearly 30 GW generated from its Khavda park in Gujarat alone.\nFailing to transition to renewable energy is not an option, said Adani.\n“There is no choice for India but to start doing things at a previously unimagined size and scale,” the 30-year-old said.\nThat’s because energy demand is going to explode in the coming years.\nIndia is the world’s third-largest energy consuming country, although its energy use and emissions per person are less than half the world average, data from the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) shows.\nThat could change rapidly. Thanks to rising incomes, energy demand has doubled since 2000, with 80% of it still being met by coal, oil and solid biomass. Over the next three decades, the rapidly-expanding economy will see the largest energy demand growth of any country in the world, the IEA said.\n“If India does what China did, if India does what Europe did, if India does what the US did, then we are all in for a very, very bleak climatic future,” said Adani, referring to the historic use of fossil fuels as those countries developed.\nHis dire predictions are not dramatic. India is comfortably placed to grow at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years, analysts say, and may become the world’s third largest economy before the end of this decade.\nAs it develops and modernizes, its urban population will shoot up, leading to a massive rise in the construction of homes, offices, shops and other buildings. According to analysts, India is set to add the equivalent of a London to its urban population every year for the next 30 years.\nElectricity demand is expected to skyrocket in the coming years because of factors ranging from improved living standards to climate change. The latter has been fueling deadly heatwaves across India, and as a result, air conditioner ownership is set to see a sharp spike in the coming years.\nBy 2050, India’s total electricity demand from residential air conditioners is set to exceed the total energy consumption in the whole of Africa today, the IEA said.\nIndia cannot rely on fossil fuels for its burgeoning needs without disastrous consequences for efforts to tackle the climate crisis.\n“If you imagine 800 GW of coal-fired thermal capacity being added … this by itself will kill all other sustainable energy initiatives happening all across the world, in terms of carbon emissions,” said Adani.\nThe conglomerate’s green plans are impressive, but climate experts are critical of its continued massive investments in fossil fuels.\n“[Gautam] Adani continues to walk both sides of the street,” said Tim Buckley, director of Sydney-based think tank Climate Energy Finance.\nThe Adani Group is not only one of the largest developers and operators of coal mines in India, but also operates the controversial Carmichael Coal Mine in Australia, which has faced fierce opposition from climate change campaigners who say it is a “death sentence” for the Great Barrier Reef.\n“Rather than ploughing billions into new fossil fuel projects, India would be far better served if Adani put 100% of its efforts and resources into developing low-cost zero emissions technologies,” Buckley added.\nThat is not an option at the moment, said Adani.\nMore than 600 million people in India will be “coming into middle income and upper income over the next decade, decade and a half,” he said. “They cannot be deprived of basic needs of energy. ”\nEveryone would be happy if we could “have a 100% of that being provided from sustainable energy sources …[but]… practically, that’s not an option” at the moment, he added.\nHe also said that activists in developed nations, which have historically emitted more greenhouse gases, are often unable to understand the staggering challenge facing India to grow its economy and its clean energy industry at the same time.\n“I think it’s also very important to respect the fact that every country has its own right to make sure that the people of their own country are well-served from an energy perspective,” Adani said.\n“So is India doing a bit of coal? Yes, of course India is. But is India doing a massive amount of renewables? Yes, there’s no question,” he added\n",

    "content": "If you took an American Airlines flight in the 1960s, you’d be wined and dined from the Coach-class  “Royal Coachman” menu. Your meal began with the beef consommé and proceeded to sautéed breast of chicken in wine. Care for a fruit tartlet for dessert?\nToday, if you’re flying coach, you’ll need to book a long-distance international flight or – maybe if you’re lucky – a coast-to-coast domestic one to receive a free meal. On shorter flights, you might get a choice of complementary Biscoff cookies or pretzels.\nAirplane food has fallen a long way from the glory days of in-flight dining when meals were served on white tablecloths and stewardesses scrambled eggs in the air. Disappearing meals have joined a long list of pain points, inconveniences and cutbacks that fliers endure today. But industry cost-cutting isn’t the only reason your tartlet is gone. The end of in-flight dining for many passengers surprisingly rose out of big changes in government regulation, airplane design, in-flight movies, industry tax breaks, plus heightened health and safety concerns.\nAirline safety protocols and regulations since September 11 have changed what types of cooking knives crews can work with in the air. Airplane galleys are smaller to allow for more passenger seats on a plane. And airlines don’t serve some foods, like peanuts, to protect people with allergies. Meals are often smaller, blander or non-existent.\n“Meal service was once a point of pride,” said Henry Harteveldt, who covers the travel industry for Atmosphere Research Group. Now, “the quality is so poor you have to wonder: Do airline executives actually have taste buds?”\nAirlines have long looked for ways to cut food production costs and reduce meal preparation times for flight attendants on board. In one famous example during the 1980s, Robert Crandall, then the head of American Airlines, bragged about how removing just one olive from every salad saved the airline $40,000 a year.\nCost and speed became more important to airlines than how the food tastes ever since. Carriers like Singapore Airlines or Delta may have partnerships with Michelin-starred celebrity chefs, but most companies farm out their food to catering services who may prepare it hours ahead.\n“People are willing to trade food for low fares,” said Blaise Waguespack, a professor of airline marketing at Embry‑Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida. “Your ticket gets you the seat. And anything beyond the seat you pay for.”\nCharging passengers for food on board – even just a few dollars for a sandwich, snack box or cheese plate - is also a way for airlines to save on taxes. Domestic airfares are subject to a 7.5% federal excise tax, but that tax doesn’t apply to baggage fees and on-board food, both of which are getting more expensive.\nFood on planes has been around almost a century, ever since 1920s flight attendants handed out chewing gum to passengers to relieve pressure in their ears. Early airplanes bounced so much in flight that meals were served on paper plates, according to the Smithsonian.\nFor decades, the federal government regulated airfare and routes, so airlines tried to set themselves apart with service, food and the kind of luxury usually afforded cruise passengers – or a Bond villain.\nUntil 1978, when the airline industry was deregulated, the law required that every passenger got an entrée, two vegetables, a salad, dessert and a drink as part of their ticket price, according to the Smithsonian.\n“Delicious food adds to the enjoyment. It’s prepared in four simultaneously operating galleys, where dishes can be cooked in five-minute ovens,” Pan Am advertised in a 1958 commercial.\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, airlines routinely installed sky-high kitchens on board and advertised their menus to draw customers. Beef was a business strategy.\n”Airlines competed on service and amenities. Meal service was a big focus of [competition] because entertainment options were more limited,” Harteveldt said. “Airlines would have teams of chefs, their own catering kitchens [and] advertising around food.”\nAs deregulation took hold, airlines cut ticket prices. But to make up for lost revenue, they cut back on food choices and other services as well.\nThe September 11 attacks accelerated the decline of free airline meals. Airlines faced a deep reduction in demand and slashed in-flight meal service in response. United, American Airlines, Delta and others announced sharp reductions in-flight meal service shortly after the attacks.\nThe last holdout, Continental Airlines, became the final major airline to end free domestic meals in economy class in 2010.\nAirline meals had been the brunt of jokes and criticism for decades, but now people miss them. Few airline-industry experts see them coming back anytime soon in coach.\nThe reality is very different for business and first-class passengers.\nMolly Brandt, the executive chef of culinary innovation for North America at in-flight catering company Gategroup, said that the “golden age for airline food is here.” It just depends on which airline you’re flying and category you’re in. “It’s broken down by cabin class,” she explained.\nIf you’re in first class on an American flight, for example, you may have a lunch choice of a Mediterranean bowl, chicken breast with mojo sauce, Poblano black bean rice and plantains or penne pasta with plant-based ragu and ricotta. For Delta, pick between the cheeseburger, the spinach and cheese agnolotti, or a Hempler’s smoked peppered chicken breast salad.\nA handful of airlines even offer caviar to first class passengers. But most fliers these days don’t even get the free chewing gum.\n",

    "content": "Volkswagen’s orders for electric vehicles shot up in Europe in the first quarter of 2024 compared with a year ago, countering suggestions that drivers may be losing interest in EVs.\nNew orders for electric cars more than doubled in Europe, Volkswagen said in an earnings statement Tuesday. The company does not release order numbers for other markets.\nThe jump in orders at Europe’s biggest carmaker comes amid concerns about slowing EV sales in the region, and as EV makers grapple with slim profits margins, squeezed by increasing competition.\n“The future will be electric, this is our conviction,” chief financial officer Arno Antlitz told analysts and journalists on a call Tuesday. He acknowledged, however, that the pace of EV sales growth in Europe and the United States had been slower than the German carmaker had originally anticipated.\nEV penetration “will increase quarter-by-quarter, year-over-year, but not as fast as we have expected,” he said.\nAs for Volkswagen’s EV deliveries, they declined 16% in Europe in the first quarter compared with the same period in 2023. “All-electric deliveries in Europe were impacted by supply bottlenecks,” a company spokesperson told CNN. “There is a time gap between incoming orders and the delivery to the customer. The supply bottlenecks mentioned impacted the delivery performance in Q1.”\nRelated article\nA brutal elimination round is reshaping the world’s biggest market for electric cars\nMeanwhile, in China, Volkswagen’s single largest market, EV deliveries almost doubled to 41,033 units from a “weak prior-year figure,” the company said in a statement.\nThe champion of German manufacturing is struggling to defend its share of the Chinese car market — the biggest in the world — where it has fallen behind Tesla and local EV producers such as BYD.\nVolkswagen said its plans to significantly reduce battery and material costs would enable it to be cost-competitive with Chinese rivals by 2026. That should then allow it to reduce the price of its EVs in China, where fierce competition has led to intense price wars.\nOn EVs, “you see… a very challenging pricing environment” in China, Antlitz said. He added that Volkswagen would make “sound compromises” between “pricing and volume” in the country.\nThe carmaker plans to launch four new models in China over the next three years, two of which will be electric, while reducing time to market for new products and features by 30%.\n“With these actions and our highly profitable combustion engine car business, we are well-prepared to continue to play a leading role in China,” Antlitz said.\nVolkswagen is aiming to keep its market share in China roughly stable at 15% by the end of the decade, according to a presentation to investors.\nThe company’s profit plunged 20% to €4.6 billion ($4.9 billion) in the the first quarter, hurt by lower sales and higher costs.\n“As expected, our first-quarter results show a slow start to the year,” Antlitz said in a statement. But he added: “We remain confident of achieving our financial targets for 2024.”\nVolkswagen expects to pay out €900 million ($965 million) in severance costs to employees this year, as it slashes the size of its workforce as part of a €10 billion ($10.8 billion) cost-cutting program to boost efficiency.\n",

    "publishedAt": "10:34 AM EDT, Thu April 25, 2024",
    "content": "Editor’s Note: Warning: This story contains a graphic image.\nHamas released a video of Israeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin on Wednesday, the first proof that he survived being badly wounded during his capture on October 7.\nGoldberg-Polin, then 23, was kidnapped from the Nova music festival during Hamas’ attacks on Israel when more than 1,200 people died and more than 200 people were taken hostage.\nHe is shown in the undated video with part of his left arm missing several inches above the hand.\nVideo filmed on October 7 showed Goldberg-Polin being taken hostage with his arm severely injured. A firsthand account from a young woman, who was in a bunker with him when Hamas attacked, said he had helped to throw grenades out, before his arm was blown off from the elbow down.\nThe latest video shows Goldberg-Polin sitting in a chair, addressing the camera. Gesturing occasionally with his injured arm, he identifies himself and gives his date of birth and parents’ names.\nHe says he has been “here for almost 200 days,” suggesting the video was filmed shortly before Tuesday, the 200th day of the war.\nGoldberg-Polin’s hair is cropped short in the video, which is edited with a number of cuts from wide shot to close up.\nHe criticizes the Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as other Israeli hostages in Hamas propaganda videos have done. Held captive in Gaza for six months, he is almost certainly speaking under duress.\nHe mentions Israeli government ministers sitting down to holiday dinners with their families, an apparent reference to the Jewish holiday of Passover, which began Monday night and is traditionally celebrated with a family dinner.\nHe urges his own family to stay strong for him and finishes by saying he hopes he was able to give them some comfort on the holiday.\nThe Biden administration received the video Monday – two days before Hamas made it public – and officials have since been in contact with Goldberg-Polin’s family, according to a US official. The FBI’s Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell is running point on examining the video for any potential evidence and information that can be gleaned about Goldberg-Polin and his captivity, the official said.\nGoldberg-Polin is among the most recognizable of the 129 hostages who remain in Gaza. Banners and murals are displayed in Jerusalem, saying: “Bring Hersh Home,” and his parents Rachel and Jonathan regularly meet top US officials in Washington to press the case of the hostages.\nOf the 129 October 7 hostages still being held in Gaza, the Israeli government believes 33 are dead.\nFollowing the release of the video, the Goldberg-Polin family demanded immediate action to release their son and the other hostages still held in Gaza.\n“Seeing the video of Hersh today is overwhelming. We are relieved to see him alive, but we are also concerned about his health and wellbeing as well as that of all the other hostages and all of those suffering in this region,” his parents Rachel Goldberg-Polin and Jon Polin said in a video statement.\nThe Goldberg-Polin family has called on the negotiating parties, including Qatar, Egypt, the United States, Hamas, and Israel, to intensify efforts and strike a deal that would reunite families and end their suffering.\nThey also sent a personal message to their son, “Hersh, we heard your voice today for the first time in 201 days. If you can hear us, know that we love you. Stay strong, survive.”\nThe hostage video released Wednesday of Goldberg-Polin was the first proof he had survived his injuries sustained on October 7. Previous footage, taken on the day of that attack, shows Hamas fighters leading him away from the bomb shelter with part of his arm missing.\nThe first time Goldberg-Polin’s parents saw that video was following an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper in October. The pair were recalling eyewitness accounts of how their son was taken into captivity during a live TV interview, when Cooper realized he had heard details of the story before.\nDays earlier, an Israeli soldier at the site of the Nova music festival had shown Cooper a video of Hamas fighters lobbing grenades into a bomb shelter. The video also showed a young Israeli man – with his hand blown off and bone protruding from his wrist – being marched out of the shelter and thrown along with four others into the back of a truck. Cooper realized this was Rachel and John’s son.\nNot wanting to spring the news on them on live TV, Cooper contacted them after the interview and asked if they wanted to see the video. They later confirmed the man in the video was their son and asked that the video be shared more widely.\nRachel Goldberg-Polin was told by eyewitnesses that as many as 29 people had huddled together in the shelter before Hamas began to throw grenades inside. Eight people survived by hiding under the bodies of the dead, while her son was one of several hostages taken.\nRachel Goldberg-Polin has campaigned for her son’s release for the past six months. She told CNN in January that she wears a piece of tape marking each day that has passed since Hersh was snatched by Hamas fighters.\nHersh, who is left-handed, was set to go on a round-the-world trip he had planned. On December 27, when he had been scheduled to leave, his mother went to the airport with friends and handed stickers of Hersh to passengers on his flight, asking them to send photos from places they visit.\nCNN’s MJ Lee contributed reporting.\n",

    "content": "Ukraine shot down a Russian fighter jet in the east of the country on Saturday, according to Kyiv, as Moscow's aircraft continue attacks with lethal aerial bombs.\nUkraine's 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade shot down \"another Russian Su-25 in the Donetsk region today,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an address on Saturday.\n\"Good job, guys!\" the Ukrainian leader added.\nUkraine often publicizes when it reports the loss of a Russian aircraft, including Su-25 jets. Last month, the head of the U.S.' European Command, General Christopher Cavoli, told U.S. lawmakers that Russia had lost around 10 percent of its aircraft fleet in the full-scale war which is in its third year.\nKyiv's air force is expected to have Western-provided F-16 fighter jets in the coming weeks, many months after the jets were originally pledged by a handful of Ukraine's backers. The jets, although not a gamechanger in small numbers, will help replenish aircraft losses with more advanced hardware.\nUkrainian air force spokesperson Illya Yevlash said the country's ground forces had targeted the Russian Su-25 jet. \"We see excellent work, including the work of small- and medium-range air-defense units that can effectively deal with various types of air targets, including aircraft,\" Yevlash said, according to Ukrainian media.\n\"I want to thank each warrior in our mobile firing groups, in the air force, in air-defense units of other types and branches of the military forces—all those who are protecting now and will continue to protect the Ukrainian skies from Russian terror,\" Zelensky added. \"It is important to be as attentive as possible these days.\"\nNewsweek has reached out to the Russian Defense Ministry for comment via email.\nAir defenses have long been a priority for Ukraine, key for fending off persistent attacks from Russia's larger and more advanced air force. Zelensky said on Saturday that Russia had fired eight missiles and \"almost 70\" guided aerial bombs along the border and the front line.\nIn recent weeks, Russian jets have launched guided aerial bombs from outside the reach of Ukraine's air defenses. Moscow has used modified Soviet-era \"dumb\" munitions, converted into precision-guided winged bombs, to devastate Kyiv's positions.\nUkraine has consistently lobbied for more Western-made air-defense systems, and the missiles to keep them firing, in the face of near-constant strikes. A recently-committed tranche of military aid from the U.S., that had spent months languishing in Congress, focused on Kyiv's air-defense needs, as well as refilling artillery ammunition stocks.\n",

    "content": "Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, rebuked Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson, calling it an \"utterly ridiculous\" plan on Saturday.\nGreene, a Georgia Republican, announced on Wednesday that she plans to call a vote on her previously unprivileged motion to vacate Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, sparking criticism from several members of the GOP who warned the move may be damaging to the party.\nGreene introduced the motion to vacate Johnson in March after he passed the $1.2 trillion spending package with Democratic support to fund the government. Greene, a staunch supporter of former President Donald Trump, has continued to scrutinize Johnson over his support for the bipartisan spending bill that includes $60.8 billion of aid to Ukraine in its ongoing war with Russia. Meanwhile, Johnson has continued to face mounting criticism from House conservatives as he pushed forward the bill, which passed House legislation late last month.\nSince Greene's announcement, several Republicans have criticized the congresswoman.\nCruz rebuked Greene's plans on Saturday as he told The Hill, \"I think it is utterly ridiculous and counterproductive.\"\nSenator Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, also criticized Greene on CNN late last month, describing her as \"uninformed\" and a \"total waste of time.\"\n\"She is a horrible leader. She is dragging our brand down. She, not the Democrats, are the biggest risk to us getting back to a majority,\" he said.\nHowever, Greene has previously fired back at her critics as she said that she doesn't \"give a rat's a**\" what her colleagues think about her hopes to remove Johnson.\n\"I voted for Mike Johnson because his voting record before he became speaker was conservative. But once he became speaker, he has become a man that none of us recognize,\" the congresswoman said Wednesday at a news conference announcing her plans to hold a vote.\nNewsweek has reached out to Cruz and Greene's office via email for additional comment.\nSo far, only two other Republicans have come out in support of Greene, Representatives Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona.\nMeanwhile, the House Democratic leadership has also said it is against the vote.\nIf a vote is held on the motion to vacate, Johnson may need to turn to Democrats to save his speakership due to the GOP's slim 4-seat majority. Due to other vacancies, this would leave Johnson with room for only one Republican detractor, barring any Democratic support.\nIn addition, Representatives Anna Paulina Luna and Matt Gaetz, both Florida Republicans, have warned that Greene's efforts could also lead to the possibility that a Democrat could become speaker.\nDuring an interview on Rumble with Gaetz last month, Luna reiterated her criticisms of Johnson, but warned against the possibility that a Democrat could become speaker.\n\"The Uniparty has prioritized foreign interests again and placed America last. Speaker Johnson has gone back on most of what he said when we elected him to be Speaker, rendering him almost unrecognizable as a legislator and the leader we chose. That being said, the possibility of a Democratic-controlled House poses a greater risk. We stand as the last barrier that has stopped Biden from completely ruining our country. Given our historically narrow majority, we must not allow the gavel to pass to the Democrats,\" Luna previously told Newsweek.\nMeanwhile, in response to the recent calls for Johnson to vacate, the House speaker warned about what a motion to vacate would mean for Congress during a press conference last month.\n\"I don't think that would be helpful to us from a political standpoint for the Republican Party to continue to govern, maintain and keep our majority in November. I think that would have been a great hindrance to it. And so, that wouldn't be helpful. Nor does a motion to vacate help us in that regard, either. It would be chaos in the House,\" he said.\n",

The two nations signed a security agreement this week that includes supplying a total of 30 of the U.S.-built fighter jets to Ukraine to ramp up its defenses amid the ongoing war launched by Russia.\n\"They are trying to tell us that the United States and NATO would stop at nothing in Ukraine,\" Lavrov said. \"Nevertheless, we hope that the Russian-Belarusian drills on the use of non-strategic nuclear weapons that are underway now will knock some sense into our opponents by reminding them about the catastrophic consequences of further nuclear escalation.\"\nLavrov added: \"These aircraft will be destroyed, like other types of weapons supplied by NATO countries to Ukraine.\"\nNewsweek has contacted Russia's Defense Ministry for comment by email.\nBelgium vowed to supply Ukraine with all 30 F-16s before 2028. Last year, Belgium, alongside Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands, announced that it would be sending Ukraine an unspecified number of the aircraft.\nBelgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said at a press briefing with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday that his country would provide Ukraine with the F-16 jets \"as soon as possible.\"\n\"Our aim is to be able to provide first aircraft before the end of this year, 2024,\" he said. \"We will do everything in our capacity to deliver some planes already this year.\"\nHowever, De Croo said the U.S.-made jets are only to be used within Ukrainian territory.\n\"Everything which is covered by this agreement is very clear: it is for utilization by the Ukrainian defense forces on Ukraine territory,\" he said.\nThere has been a growing chorus of calls for Ukraine to be authorized to use Western weapons to attack targets inside Russia, more than two years into the war launched by Moscow in February 2022.\n\"Putin has only one influence mechanism, that is the destruction of life. He is not capable of anything else,\" Zelensky said Tuesday. \"A sufficient power of weaponry is crucial so that we can physically defend [ourselves] against Russia's terror.\"\n\"They are shooting at you, and you cannot shoot back at them because you do not have the permission [from Western allies],\" he added.\n",

CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy.\nWhen it comes to airport expansion projects, the Gulf States are abuzz and the competition is fierce.\nA mammoth airport in Saudi Arabia has already set records for size, but new plans in Dubai are ratcheting up the race to be the world’s busiest airport by passenger volume.\nSaudi Arabia’s King Fahd International Airport currently wears the crown as the largest airport in the world by area. At a whopping 780 square kilometers (about 300 square miles), that’s bigger than neighboring country Bahrain.\nThe Saudis aren’t resting on their laurels, either. The country is working on a new six-runway airport on the King Fahd International site by 2030, with capacity eventually for 185 million passengers per year.\nFor comparison, that’s 75 million more than the 110 million passengers the world’s current busiest airport by passenger volume, Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International, is expected to serve this year.\nAnd this is by no means Hartsfield-Jackson’s first time at the rodeo. It’s held that position every year — except for pandemic-hit 2020 — for more than two decades.\nDubai, however, just made a huge play, laying out plans Sunday for a new $34.85 billion (AED 128 billion) passenger terminal at Dubai World Central - Al Maktoum International (DWC), the emirate’s newest airport.\nThe stakes just reached a new level.\nRelated article\nThe world’s best airports for 2024, according to Skytrax\nSince DWC - Al Maktoum International opened 14 years ago, it was always planned for this brand new airport some 20 miles southwest of downtown Dubai to become the biggest passenger-handler in the world.\nHowever, now the plan is for the megahub to eventually accommodate 260 million passengers per year. That’s a full 100 million passengers more than previous projections for the airport and would dwarf pretty much every other airport’s operations on the planet.\n“It will be five times the size of the current Dubai International Airport, and all operations at Dubai International Airport will be transferred to it in the coming years,” Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, said Sunday when outlining Dubai Aviation Engineering Projects’ strategic plan. “The airport will accommodate 400 aircraft gates and feature five parallel runways,” he added.\nDubai World Central is the newer of two international airports in Dubai. The other, Dubai International Airport, was just ranked the No. 2 busiest airport in the world, but its traffic will eventually go to the newer airport, according to DWC’s expansion plans.\nThe airport will be the centerpiece of a much larger scheme, called Dubai South, that envisages the creation of a whole new city in a 145-square-kilometer (56-square-mile) stretch of desert just south of Dubai.\nThis entire new district, of which some pieces are already starting to take shape, will have eight neighborhoods each allocated to a specific industry or activity, with a mix of residential and commercial areas as well.\n“As we build an entire city around the airport in Dubai South, demand for housing for a million people will follow. It will host the world’s leading companies in the logistics and air transport sectors,” said Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.\n“We are building a new project for future generations, ensuring continuous and stable development for our children and their children in turn. Dubai will be the world’s airport, its port, its urban hub, and its new global center.”\nWhen completed, it’ll cover a very generous 70 square kilometers (27 square miles) – although that’s still less than a tenth of the land area of Saudi Arabia’s King Fahd International. Saudi Arabia will be holding onto that world record for a while yet.\nRelated article\nDubai airport struggles to resume flights after heavy rains leave runways underwater\nAt present, Dubai World Central’s primary role is as a center for aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul – “MRO” in industry parlance. It also hosts a number of air cargo operators (including Emirates Cargo, the freight subsidiary of the UAE flag carrier) and handles executive jets and some charter flights. Those cargo operations will ultimately handle up to 12 million tonnes per annum, according to the new plans.\nAs for the timeline, well, take note of the Sheikh’s words about “our children and their children.”\nThe plan is for the first phase to be ready within 10 years, with capacity increased to 150 million passengers annually. Beyond that, we’re looking at a decades-long time frame.\n“The new airport will prepare the ground for the next 40 years of anticipated growth in Dubai’s aviation sector,” said Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.\nOn Sunday, flag-carrier Emirates took to X to announce its long-awaited relocation to its “future home” at Dubai World Central - Al Maktoum International.\nIn the meantime, though, it’s business as usual at Dubai International (DXB), which earned its No.2 busiest airport in the world title this month for the very first time, serving 104.7 passengers in 2023.\nPaul Griffiths, CEO of Dubai Airports, confirmed in a statement Sunday that “DXB will continue to serve as the primary hub […] over the next few years as phase two of DWC takes shape.”\nKeep an eye too on Hamad International Airport in nearby Qatar, a direct competitor of Dubai in the long-haul connectivity market, which is gearing up to expand its capacity to more than 60 million annual passengers.\nThis adds to other airport expansion projects in the region: the opening of a $1.8 billion brand new airport in Muscat, Oman, in 2018, the $1.1 billion new terminal in Bahrain in 2021 and, more recently, in November 2023, of Abu Dhabi’s grand new Terminal A, a 780,000-square-meter facility able to handle up to 79 aircraft simultaneously.\nAt the northern end of the Gulf, Kuwait International Airport is building a new terminal designed by renowned British architectural firm Foster+Partners, which will have the capacity to handle 25 million passengers per year initially, with the possibility of doubling it up to 50 million in the future.\nAnd less than 20 miles from Dubai’s downtown, Sharjah International Airport, which is primarily home to low-cost carrier Air Arabia, is also increasing its capacity to 20 million passengers annually.\n",

    "content": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.\nA couple of weeks ago, I rewatched Jurassic Park for probably the 10th time since the movie came out 30 years ago. (As an aside, it really holds up — 10/10, no notes.)\nEarly in the plot, when the guests are discussing their impressions of the park, Jeff Goldblum’s character (also 10/10, just perfect) launches into a speech so prescient you could sub out all the dinosaur stuff and map it onto the modern debate around artificial intelligence.\n“Don’t you see the danger, John, inherent in what you’re doing here? Genetic power is the most awesome force the planet’s ever seen, but you wield it like a kid that’s found his dad’s gun … You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could, and before you even knew what you had, you patented it, and packaged it, and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox, and now you’re selling it.”\nAnd then comes the line that later launched a thousand memes: “Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn’t stop to think if they should.”\nNaturally, the skeptic of the group is dismissed as a Luddite and the movie carries on. (Spoiler alert: The Luddite was right!)\nAI skeptics — who are legion, and not necessarily part of the fringe tin foil hat crowd — are begging Silicon Valley to take a beat before unleashing AI to the world.\nBut tech companies, faced with the most powerful computing innovation in a generation, are running around like kids who just found their dad’s gun.\nSee here: Apple and Google — which, to be sure, deserve a lot of credit for the innovations they’ve brought to the world — have recently latched on to AI-powered features to help sell their newest tablets and smartphones. After all, throwing AI into your pitch deck is a surefire way to signal to shareholders that you’re on the cutting edge, which helps distract from the fact that your company hasn’t actually produced any significant proprietary tech in years.\nIn marketing those new devices, though, Apple and Google have lost the plot.\nApple’s new iPad advertisement made headlines for all the wrong reasons this week. The spot depicts a massive industrial hydraulic press slowly crushing a collection of objects that represent the human creative experience: There’s a piano, a record player blasting Sonny & Cher’s 1972 hit “All I Ever Need Is You,” cans of paint, books, a Space Invaders arcade console, a trumpet. The music bounces along as the machine switches on and smashes it all down. Then, the big reveal: It’s all contained in Apple’s new iPad, its thinnest and most powerful ever, thanks to its brand new AI chip.\nThe outrage online came fast and furious.\n“It is the most honest metaphor for what tech companies do to … artists, musicians, creators, writers, filmmakers: squeeze them, use them, not pay well, take everything then say it’s all created by them,” filmmaker Asif Kapadia wrote on X.\n“If you thought THIS IPad ad was weird, you should have seen the first cut where they lined up all your favorite characters and shot them,” quipped actor and producer Luke Barnett.\nApple issued a rare apology for the ad on Thursday, telling AdAge that “our goal is to always celebrate the myriad of ways users express themselves and bring their ideas to life through iPad. We missed the mark with this video, and we’re sorry.”\nEarlier in the week, CEO Tim Cook said Apple’s “outrageously powerful” M4 chip will power the company’s new AI tools. In other words: Check it out, Wall Street! People aren’t buying our stuff as much any more but just wait until we add bots!\nMeanwhile, is anyone else getting inundated with Google’s Pixel ads, which show people giddily using the smartphone’s AI photo-editing software to deceive their online followers?\nIn those ads, a guy who can’t dunk a basketball on his own uses a trampoline to get to the rim, and then edits out the trampoline. An imperfect group selfie gets everyone’s best angle and creates a composite image of a moment that never happened. A dad tosses his kid up playfully in the air, and then edits the image to seem, for reasons I still don’t understand, as if the kid went several inches higher into the air.\nThis is Google going, “look what we can do!” without any reflection on how pointless it all is. It is, at best, distortion for distortion’s sake. At worst, it’s distortion for the sake of conditioning regular people to be cool with the idea of visual misinformation.\nSmartphones and tablets were invented to enhance our lived experience, to make it easier to leave the house and go to the beach and meet up with friends — just a good camera-computer combo that fits in your pocket.\nTheoretically, our phones and tablets will become even more useful with AI, serving as virtual assistants that can do all the boring stuff we don’t want to, like summarizing all your new emails and filtering out junk. There’s a world in the not too distant future, according to AI proponents, where you can simply tell Siri or Google “order my usual breakfast from the coffee shop near the office, I’ll be there in 10 minutes to pick it up,” and the bot will do just that.\nWe’re not there yet, however. And so far, the consumer applications for AI are simultaneously underwhelming and dystopian.\nDistorted images may be harmless social media fodder, until they become propaganda spread by bad actors.\nApple is expected to announce its own ChatGPT-like tools that could be a game changer for your internet searches. But generative AI bots are also prone to give wrong answers and experience hallucinations, and no one seems to know what happens when the bots run out of human-generated data to learn from and start hoovering up their own artificial texts like a snake eating its own tail.\nThe Jeff Goldblums of the AI debate — who include some of the industry’s own pioneers — are not necessarily saying we have to smother AI and pretend it never existed. Most of them are just your friendly neighborhood skeptic, walking around going, “hey, should we really do that?”\nClearly, we weren’t invited to Apple’s or Google’s marketing meetings.\n",

    "publishedAt": "4:35 AM EDT, Fri April 26, 2024",
    "content": "Aya Nakamura was born in the former French colony of Mali, raised in France and is widely considered the most streamed female Francophone artist in the world.\nThe 28-year-old, as well as being Malian, is a French citizen, and a multiple-platinum-selling pop star who was brought up in the Parisian suburbs. However, ahead of Paris 2024, Nakamura finds herself at the center of France’s culture wars.\nAmid widespread rumors the singer would perform at the Games’ Opening Ceremony, singing an Edith Piaf song, some members of France’s far-right have questioned whether she embodies French heritage, values and identity. Piaf is a key figure in France’s musical – and national – identity.\n“There’s no way Aya. This is Paris, not the market in Bamako,” said fringe and extreme far-right group Les Natifs (Natives) on X, formerly known as Twitter, in March, referring to Mali’s capital.\nNakamura has defended herself on social media, saying on X: “I’m becoming the number one state subject in debates …but what do I really owe you all? Nothing.”\nThe singer has received support from Rachida Dati, France’s Minister of Culture, who spoke out in defence of Nakamura, saying “be careful of the pretext of attacking someone out of pure racism.”\nParis 2024’s organizing committee told CNN: “We were very shocked by the racist attacks against Aya Nakamura in recent days. We offer our full support to the most listened-to French artist in the world.”\nWhether Nakamura will perform at the Olympics’ opening ceremony is still unconfirmed, with the Paris 2024 organizing committee telling CNN that they “won’t be confirming or denying” any rumors or reports, to “leave room for surprises” on the day.\nCNN has reached out to Nakamura but she declined to be interviewed on the matter.\nHowever, many others in France are all too keen to comment on this cause célèbre.\nFar-right politician Marion Maréchal, who is the niece of far-right National Rally party leader Marine Le Pen and a member of the Reconquête party, told French television stations BMFTV and Europe 1 that Nakamura “does not sing in French,” referencing the blend of Parisian and African derived slang that often feature in her lyrics.\n“I think that the people who criticize her actually don’t accept that she embodies France,” French activist Rokhaya Diallo told CNN. “The slang she uses is used by young people and a lot of young French people use slang.”\nNakamura often uses a mix of verlan and African derived slang from languages such as Bambara, from her birth country Mali, in her music. Her number one hit song “Djadja,” contains the lyric “le monde est tit-pe” – the world is small – with word ‘tit-pe’ inverting the French word ‘petit.’\nVerlan, a type of French slang named after the inversion of the French word ‘l’envers’ – meaning backwards – originates from the outskirts of Paris known as ‘la cité’ (the suburbs) that have had large immigrant population.\nAt the inauguration of the Olympic Aquatics Centre earlier this month, French President Emanuel Macron said that Nakamura “speaks to a good number of our compatriots” and claimed that “these games and ceremonies should reflect us, and she contributes to French culture, to French music.”\n“I want to defend here these choices and defend the fact that there must be artistic freedom and that politics should not interfere,” added Macron.\nIn an interview with France Inter, Macron’s political rival Le Pen, known for her right-wing views, claimed that the President was seeking to “outrage” and “humiliate the French people” when asked whether she thinks Nakamura opening the games would be a good symbol.\nWhen asked to further explain why this choice would be a humiliation, Le Pen responded “she does not sing in French, or a foreign language, she sings nonsense.”\nSpeaking to CNN, Professor of Political Science at the University of Nice, Vincent Martigny, said that while there are those who believe it is right to promote minorities and their role in French culture, there are others, who hold more traditional views, which he terms as racist in relation to the country’s colonial past.\nThere have been moments of perceived unity in France’s past, notably when the men’s national soccer team won the 1998 World Cup.\nThat triumph helped popularise the slogan “Black, Blanc, Beur” – Black, White, Arab  – amid a push for unity and inclusion. Beur’ is verlan for the French word ‘arabe.’\nFrance’s World Cup winning team of 1998 was made up of a diverse group of players, not only of European descent but also from the ex-colonies of France and other countries. Many thought at the time that the 1998 team was a sign of a truly integrated, multi-cultural France.\nBut notable social and cultural divisions have emerged in France in recent years.\nThere have been multiple bans and restrictions against Islamic dress. The nationwide ban on public schoolchildren wearing abayas, was denounced as an “Islamophobic campaign” by one politician on the left. Athletes have been banned from wearing a hijab while competing representing France at the Paris Olympic Games.\nThen there have been multiple protests and riots over police brutality leading to the death of some French inhabitants of North and West African heritage from the suburbs of Paris, fueling backlash over policing methods in marginalized communities.\nNakamura’s birth country of Mali is one of the many former French colonies. There are millions of French citizens, like Nakamura, who are either themselves immigrants or descendants of immigrants from nations formerly colonized by France.\nThese days France finds itself embroiled in a very public debate over the recognition and acceptance of its immigrants as the country continues to reckon with its colonial history.\nProfessor Martigny believes that the nationalist party is “stronger than ever” and that nationalists in France are “more nationalist” and more open with their views today than they were in the past.\nActivist Diallo also believes that France is struggling to see itself “as it is” and recognize non-White individuals as fully French.\n“Despite her successes, despite her undeniable achievements, we still think that it’s not an honor for us to have such a woman represent us,” Diallo told CNN, referring to Nakamura.\nPolitical scientist Oliver Roy, who is Professor at the EUI School of Transnational Governance, told CNN that a common belief that could be fuelling the culture wars in France is an ideology expressed “not just [by] the extreme right, but also part of the traditional centre right” known as “the great replacement.”\nHe describes the term as “the idea that there is a new population coming from the south, which is replacing the old traditional, French population.” However, he maintains that this fear “is not supported by demography, [or] by statistics, and is, of course, very ideological.”\nAccording to Martigny, France’s cultural divisions are amplified on social media by both extremes of the political spectrum.\n“Because of the social networks, public debates are more violent on these issues than they used to be,” he said.\n“There’s a theatre for the expression of extremely strong minded, sometimes racist, very often offensive comments on Twitter, on X, and on other social networks,” added Martigny.\n“You have a lot of X accounts who are really, really, really pro far-right. And so they played a role in discussing these issues and making it a controversy. And then this controversy is exported to the traditional media.”\nAs Nakamura was targeted by fringe and extreme far-right groups as well as far-right politicians, in an interview with BMFTV and RMC, Macron said that “the reactions shocked me … there were truly racist reactions.”\nHowever, Martigny says he sees Macron’s condemnation of the attacks as racist as an attempt to balance the scales after the passing of what the professor called a “very restrictive law on immigration” a few months ago.\nIn December, Macron passed a controversial bill calling for tougher immigration that was endorsed by the far-right, and rejected by many in his own camp.\nPoliticians such as Le Pen hailed the legislation as an “ideological victory” whilst French health Minister, Aurelien Rousseau resigned in protest. It included many amendments tightening immigration laws, one of which dictated children born to foreign parents on French soil would no longer become automatic French citizens but would have to apply for citizenship.\n“He needs to make that forgotten in a certain way by showing that he has a sense of balance on these issues,” Martigny states.\nBy promoting Nakamura, Martigny believes that Macron’s ambitions may have been to “show a very optimistic face for France.”\n“[There are] very strong cultural wars in France revolving around pop stars, and the type of pop stars that you can mobilize or the type of artists that you can mobilize when you want to unite the country.”\nWith less than 100 days to go until the Olympics, many hope Paris 2024 will give France the opportunity to show unity.\nHowever, the heated reactions to Nakamura hints at a more pessimistic outlook.\n",

    "content": "U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts has refused a request from Senate Democrats to discuss fellow conservative Justice Samuel Alito's failure to recuse himself from cases involving former President Donald Trump.\nAlito has been under fire in recent weeks over two flags associated with Trump and the January 6 Capitol riot that had been flown at his homes. He blamed his wife for raising the flags and insists that he is unbiased in matters involving the ex-president—such as Trump v. United States, the pending case on Trump's claim that he is immune to criminal charges due to presidential immunity.\nDemocratic Senators Dick Durbin and Sheldon Whitehouse sent Roberts a letter last week urging him to \"immediately take appropriate steps to ensure that Justice Alito will recuse himself\" from cases related to Trump and to meet \"as soon as possible \"to address the Supreme Court's ethics crisis.\" Alito sent the senators his own letter on Wednesday, writing that no \"reasonable\" person would question his impartiality.\nRoberts replied to Durbin and Whitehouse in a letter on Thursday. He declined the senators' request for a meeting, citing \"separation of powers concerns and the importance of preserving judicial independence counsel against such appearances\" and reaffirming Alito's right to decide his own \"recusal issues.\"\nThe response quickly sparked fury from some on social media, inspiring accusations of \"corruption\" by Roberts and demands that Senate Democrats take further action.\n\"John Roberts, again, has already spoken about Alito's ethical failures. And Roberts is IN FAVOR of the corruption, not against it,\" lawyer Elie Mystal wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\"Roberts is every bit as bad as Alito and [Supreme Court Justice Clarence] Thomas,\" wrote political analyst David Rothkopf. \"He is an utter failure as a Chief Justice.\"\n\"BREAKING: Chief \"justice\" John Roberts DECLINES the meeting request from @SenatorDurbin and @SenWhitehouse, and says it's up to Alito whether he recuses (he said he won't). Can we subpoena them now? Or are we gonna write more letters?\" wrote Allison Gill of the Mueller, She Wrote podcast.\n\"Senate democrats need to act,\" political commentator Molly Jong-Fast wrote.\nNewsweek reached out for comment to a Supreme Court spokesperson via email on Thursday.\nDurbin responded to Roberts' refusal with his own X post on Thursday, promising that Senate Democrats would continue an \"investigation\" into alleged Supreme Court ethics issues.\n\"Let's be clear: Chief Justice Roberts could establish an enforceable code of conduct today... if he wanted to,\" wrote Durbin. \"But, he's refused. So long as he does, we will continue our investigation and pursue an enforceable code of conduct.\"\nOn Wednesday, Trump praised Alito for refusing to recuse himself over the flags—which are associated with the post-2020 election \"Stop the Steal\" movement and conservative Christian nationalism—writing on Truth Social that the justice displayed the \"guts\" and \"grit\" required to combat President Joe Biden.\n",

    "content": "On delivery day at the Manganese Metal Company’s industrial complex in Mbombela, South Africa, truckloads of manganese ore from the Kalahari Basin in the Northern Cape are ushered inside for processing.\nManganese is commonly found in the Earth’s crust. The mineral is not only known for its nutritional benefits, but it’s critical in the production of steel and batteries.\nSouth Africa has the world’s largest manganese reserves; however, the International Manganese Institute estimates only 2% of the manganese ore produced within the country is locally processed. The Manganese Metal Company is looking to fill this gap.\nThe refinery says it receives about 80,000 metric tons of manganese a year to produce high grade electrolytic manganese metal (EMM) - one of the critical alloy components to make steel.\nThe company’s CEO, Louis Nel, says over the last decade it has seen a “significant” increase in demand for refined manganese in part due to the growing demand for lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles (EV).\n“With the growth in EV sales globally, that requires raw materials and batteries. Manganese is a key component in those batteries. So of course, with the uptick in EVs, the raw materials are pulled along,” Nel said.\nMost manganese by-products are found within the steel industry. Aloys d’Harambure, the executive director of the International Manganese Institute, says only 2% of manganese is used for batteries, with only 1% of that going toward rechargeable batteries.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) found the demand for automotive lithium-ion batteries increased 65% in 2022 due to rising EV sales. And while there are several ways to create lithium-ion batteries, the chemistry combination of lithium, nickel, manganese, and cobalt oxide (NMC) supplied 60% of the market share, according to the IEA.\nCompared to other minerals used to make lithium-ion batteries, Nel says manganese, “provides some thermal stability to the battery, which is a safety concern” and is more affordable.\nWhile the opportunity sounds promising, creating these batteries is no easy feat. “A battery consumes manganese in the form of chemical and that’s where the bottleneck is,” d’Harambure said.\nHe explains manufacturers need to use a high purity manganese sulfate to make the type of battery used in EVs. About 90% of these chemicals are processed in China, he adds, but notes there is a growing push to build chemical processing facilities in other parts of the world.\nRelated article\nA company bought gas rights to this land for $1. Helium means it could be worth billions\n“Next year we should see some production in South Africa and in Mexico, and progressively in the US and Australia,” he said.\nWith an abundance of manganese reserves, South Africa has potential to become a leader in high purity manganese sulfate production, but d’Harambure says “issues with the electricity sector in South Africa” and “an increase in electricity prices” have made it difficult to produce manganese chemicals and alloys there.\nD’Harambure adds the country has been slow to open manganese chemical processing facilities due to the lack of local customers that would use the product.\n“It’s better to build the manganese chemical facility near the customer because transporting manganese to another country is not extremely expensive – what is expensive is producing the chemical,” he said.\nThese obstacles are not stopping the Manganese Metal Company from trying to capitalize on the EV boom and expand its processing facilities. The company says it is planning to build a $25 million commercial plant that can produce 5,000 metric tons of battery-grade manganese sulphate a year. Nel says he’s optimistic it can complete the build within 18 months and bring products to market by the end of 2026.\nAccess to this “strategic” metal valued by the US and Europe gives Africa advantages, Nel says, adding it will also generate “huge job creation opportunities, as well as economic growth.”\nSeveral sectors within the local economy are already reaping the benefits of manganese. According to the International Manganese Institute, the manganese mining industry employed more than 20,000 South Africans in 2022.\nD’Harambure also points to a need beyond steel and batteries for the green economy.\n“Manganese is essential to producing several other green power technologies including solar panels (and) wind turbines. It’s also used to treat wastewater and extract pollutants from soil and air,” he said. “So, the whole push towards greener energy directly benefits to manganese industry.”\n",

    "content": "The Group of Seven nations announced Tuesday its member nations would end the use of “unabated” coal by 2035, but left the door open for countries to stretch that deadline in particular contexts.\nIn a communiqué published after talks between energy, climate and environment ministers in Turin, Italy, the group announced it had committed to “phase out existing unabated coal power generation in our energy systems during the first half of 2030s,” in a climate policy breakthrough that G7 negotiators had previously failed to achieve in several years of talks.\nBut by referring to “unabated” coal, the agreement leaves room for countries to use the fossil fuel past 2035 if their carbon pollution is captured before entering the atmosphere.\nThe agreement also includes a caveat that countries could choose “a timeline consistent with keeping a limit of 1.5°C temperature rise within reach, in line with countries’ net-zero pathways.”\nThat caveat appears to allow those countries to keep using coal past 2035, as long as their overall national emissions won’t contribute to global warming of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Science shows that some of the planet’s ecosystems will reach tipping points or struggle to adapt beyond that point.\nSeveral members of the G7, which represents the biggest economies in the developed world, have already come close to ending the use of coal. Coal makes up less than 6% of the electricity mix in the UK, Italy and Canada, and almost nothing in France. But it still comprises 32% of Japan’s electricity mix, 27% of Germany’s and 16% of the US’, according to the think tank Ember.\nThe agreement comes just days after the US Environmental Protection Agency announced new rules that will require coal-fired power plants to either capture nearly all of their climate pollution or shut down by 2039. CNN has reached out to the White House and State Department for comment.\nWhen questioned by journalists on the caveats in the G7’s agreement, Italian Environment and Energy Security Minister Gilberto Pichetto Fratin defended the agreement, saying the language shows “G7 countries undertake to phase out the use of coal, without jeopardizing the various countries’ economic and social equilibrium.”\nThe language is weaker than what UK minister Andrew Bowie told a reporter on Monday: that the group had agreed to end coal by 2035, making no reference to unabated coal or wiggle room in the timeline.\nRelated article\nClimate change will make you poorer, according to a new report\nDespite the caveats, several climate policy experts welcomed the announcement, describing it as a breakthrough after years of roadblocks on the issue.\n“Stamping an end date on the coal era is precisely the kind of leadership we need from the world’s wealthiest countries,” said Jennifer Layke, the global director for energy at the World Resources Institute. “This decision provides a beacon of hope for the rest of the world, showing the transition away from coal can happen much faster than many thought possible.”\nBut the think tank Climate Analytics said that, while the announcement would put pressure on Japan, the only G7 member that hasn’t set an end date for coal, the 2035 deadline is too late to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees.\nAn analysis by the think tank shows all coal use in G7 nations needs to end by 2030 at the latest – and natural gas use should end by 2035 – to prevent global warming exceeding the 1.5-degree threshold.\nRelated article\nA plant that’s everywhere is fueling a growing risk of wildfire disaster\n“Many of these countries have already publicly committed to phase out dates ahead of 2030, and only have a small amount of coal capacity anyway,” said Jane Ellis, head of climate policy at Climate Analytics.\nIt’s notable that a gas phase-out was not mentioned, Ellis added. “In the last decade, gas has been the largest source of the global increase in CO2 emissions, and many G7 governments are investing in new domestic gas facilities. This is absolutely the wrong direction to be heading in – both economically and for the climate.”\nG7 should make the transition to renewables faster, Ellis said.\nFossil fuels are the primary driver of the climate crisis, and coal is typically the most polluting of all fossil fuels. But putting an end date on coal has been highly controversial. Japan has blocked progress on the issue at past G7 meetings, CNN has previously reported.\nAlmost every country in the world agreed last year to transition away from fossil fuels at the COP28 climate talks in Dubai, but failing to put an end date on coal was seen as a shortcoming of those negotiations.\nThe G7 typically leads on global climate policy. The group’s decisions often trickle down or influence the wider G20, which includes other big emitters, like China and India, as well as major fossil fuel producers, such as Saudi Arabia and Russia.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\nCNN’s Ella Nilsen and Laura Paddison contributed to this report.\n",

    "content": "Florida A&M University is putting a purported $237.75 million donation “on pause,” after media reports and college board leaders raised concerns about the actual value of the stock gift—and the details surrounding the donor’s previous donations.\n“A decision that was made yesterday to put a pause on this activity—a hold, is more or less, is the language that was used—pending some additional information that has come to my attention,” FAMU President Larry Robinson said Thursday during an emergency school board meeting, called after media reports and school leaders raised concerns about the legitimacy of the gift.\nIt’s a stunning reversal from the fanfare last Saturday at FAMU’s commencement ceremony, when the announcement of the gift made headlines as one of the largest ever personal donations ever to a historically Black college or university.\nGregory Gerami, the 30-year-old CEO of Texas hydroponic hemp farm company Batterson Farms Corp., presented the $237.75 million stock gift via an oversized, ceremonial check to university administration members including Robinson, who called the gift “breathtaking in its generosity and its scope” via a press release the day of the donation.\nBut the jubilance quickly gave way to skepticism.\nA report from Politico noted Batterson Farms Corp. is a comparatively small company, and that its private shares are unlikely to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\nIn 2020, a notable deal involving a donor later identified as Gerami fell apart. South Carolina’s Coastal Carolina University had announced a $95 million donation from an anonymous donor, who then backed out months later. An investigation by the Myrtle Beach Sun News identified Gerami in a story that noted, among other details, that he backed out alleging racism from CCU officials—an allegation they denied.\nAt an emergency board meeting on Thursday, FAMU board of trustee and foundation members expressed their concerns and frustration about the school’s vetting process involving Gerami’s donation.\nSeveral members of the FAMU Foundation Board of Directors and Deveron Gibbons, the vice chair of the university’s Board of Trustees, said they were not informed of the donation until it was announced at commencement.\n“This meeting is taking place because no one, as I am aware of from this conversation, had any clue this was going on,” Gibbons told CNN. “We are talking about a transformational, largest in HBCU history donation: big check on stage, with press involved and big PR campaign push after the fact. If that doesn’t show that we need to take a step back and get our own house in order, I don’t know what else does.”\nGibbons has called for an independent investigation into the transaction.\n“I hope that this is a good gift. It could be transformative for the university and much needed. But we must vet the process, doing an announcement is not the first thing you do … Vet the individual. You vet the donation,” Vice Chair Gibbons said.\nBoard Chair Kristin Harper provided a statement to CNN on Friday saying, “Serious concerns have been raised regarding the validity of the gift, the adequacy of the due diligence processes and whether the Foundation Board and Board of Trustees have been provided ample oversight opportunity.”\n“I regrettably share these concerns” Harper added.\nOn May 5, just one day after the announcement at commencement, FAMU released a statement via X (formerly Twitter) insisting the university had done its “due diligence.” The statement went on to say that Gerami had transferred $237,750,000 of stocks into a FAMU account last month.\nA non-disclosure agreement requested by Gerami prohibited officials from disclosing the details to either the university’s board of trustees or the board of directors, Vice President for University Advancement Shawnta Friday-Stroud said during an emergency meeting Thursday.\n“In addition to the wealth screening that was done at the beginning, we did a more expansive screening of Mr. Gerami’s background,” Friday-Stroud said.\n“We had a discussion with Dr. Robinson, all of which has been put out on social media. We said, ‘ok, we will proceed with the decision to move forward,” Friday-Stroud added.\n“My concern is our reputation has been greatly impacted and I want to make sure that we restore faith in our alumni and all of the friends and family that support Florida A&M University,” said FAMU Foundation Board member Terry Arnold.\nWhen reached by CNN on Thursday, Gerami declined immediate comment.  He referred questions to the university and agreed to answer CNN’s questions on the following day, but he couldn’t be reached.\nFAMU’s Special Board of Trustees, which oversees the full school and the foundation, has scheduled a meeting for May 15 to discuss the donation.\nFAMU’s communications department did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on more detailed questions about the gift and the nature of the vetting process.\n",

    "content": "In the annals of American broadcast journalism, the Fairness Doctrine stands as a testament to a time when balanced reporting was more than a noble pursuit; it was a mandated practice.\nThe policy, established by the Federal Communications Commission in 1949, obligated broadcasters to present contrasting viewpoints on contentious public issues.\nThis era of regulated balance came to an end in 1987 when President Ronald Reagan's FCC decided that the increasing diversity of media outlets meant the doctrine was no longer required. This pivotal shift laid the groundwork for significant transformations in the media landscape.\nIn the post-Fairness Doctrine era, we have witnessed an unprecedented polarization of American media. Freed from the obligation to present differing perspectives, many media outlets have defaulted to presenting narratives through a singular ideological lens.\nThe end of the Fairness Doctrine isn't the sole cause of media polarization, of course. The advent of social media and the algorithm-driven delivery of news, coupled with business incentives that prioritize engagement over balance, have exacerbated the divide. The outrage economy is a self-perpetuating system.\nThese shifts have profoundly affected our democratic society. Public discourse, once anchored in a commonly accepted set of facts, has fractured into micro-environments, subsets and cohorts, each espousing its unique version of reality. This accelerates the erosion of civil dialogue, undermining a critical component of our democracy. In this polarized media landscape, trust in the so-called fourth estate has plummeted to an all-time low.\nSocial media platforms, with their indiscriminate blending of content from trusted news outlets and dubious blogs, have furthered this erosion.\nThe shift towards subscription-based business models is a double-edged sword. While it has provided a lifeline to many media organizations in the face of shrinking advertising revenues, it has also inadvertently deepened the echo chambers. By prioritizing content that affirms their subscribers' worldviews, media outlets perpetuate these bubbles. And with quality journalism often locked behind paywalls, the information divide grows wider, further threatening the democratic ideal of an informed citizenry.\nIn the face of these challenges, it's crucial to remember that the principles of the Fairness Doctrine, though no longer legally enforced, needn't be abandoned. Instead, we should strive to voluntarily integrate these principles into our journalistic practices. By emphasizing fairness, balance and a representation of diverse viewpoints in our reporting, we can begin to counteract the rampant polarization that currently plagues our media and, by extension, our public discourse.\nNavigating today's media landscape is challenging. It's shaped by a web of social, technological and economic factors that defy easy solutions. Meanwhile, the erosion of civil dialogue, the declining trust in media, and the fragmentation of our public discourse pose serious threats to our democracy.\nWe need to raise our journalistic standards. Both-sides-ism isn't fairness — it's a failure of critical thinking or intellectual honesty. Let's not be naive: There are people and interests who deliberately skew our public discourse through misdirection, false equivalence and outright lies. We must counter those pernicious efforts by demanding a commitment to good-faith debate, which will pay dividends in rebuilding the trust that across the spectrum of ideas.\nAdopting a voluntary commitment to the principles embodied in the Fairness Doctrine represents a step in the right direction. It signals our dedication to upholding the ethical tenets of journalism, our respect for diverse viewpoints and our unwavering commitment to nourishing an informed and balanced public discourse.\nWhen fairness is no longer a doctrine, it must become a practice. Our democracy, in its present state, urgently requires this shift. For the media industry, it's not just a question of ethical responsibility but an existential imperative. The very health of our democratic society might depend on it.\nOriginally published on Poynter.org\n",

    "content": "They’d always planned to retire somewhere outside the US, but when the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020, Cynthia Wilson and her husband Craig Bjork felt compelled to bring their plans forward.\nThe couple, who married in 2009, had already chosen Portugal as their intended destination after Googling “best places for Americans to retire to” and finding that the European country – a place Wilson had never visited – was high on the list.\n“It’s funny because I’ve been to like 33 countries, and almost all of northwest Europe,” Wilson, originally from Seattle, tells CNN Travel. “I’ve been to countries like Estonia, but I almost knew nothing about Portugal.\nThankfully, her husband, a former US marine, “knew everything about it.”\n“It was an ‘Aha’ moment for me,” says the retired chef and restaurant owner, explaining that Bjork was stationed in Lisbon during the late 1970s and “had regaled me with stories about his life there.”\nThe couple, who met when they were both in their 50s, initially bonded over their love for travel, and Wilson says that it’s been a “never ending conversation” ever since.\n“We started talking about our travels,” she recounts. “And we still are talking about our travels.”\nOnce they were married, Wilson and Bjork, who were based in Kansas at the time, began to think more seriously about the type of life that they wanted to have during their retirement years.\n“We were both watching our parents spend their entire savings and pensions on medical care,” says Wilson, explaining that they did a lot of research into the cost of living in Portugal and found it to be more favorable.\n“And, in Portugal, we could keep our money for travel. We were required to have private medical insurance as part of the visa process.\n“But we also would have access to the national system, particularly for hospitalizations.”\nWilson and Bjork, who previously ran a food truck named LumpiaPalooza and the Parsnipity Cafe in Wichita, Kansas, initially gave themselves six years “to plan and dream about moving to Portugal.”\nHowever, they opted to speed things up “rather than to go into debt to keep the business alive” during the pandemic.\n“We decided to retire two years early,” explains Wilson. “So we retired in 2020 and started the paperwork.”\nThe couple applied for a D7 visa, also known as the “Retirement visa,” which required them to meet specific requirements, including either proof of purchase of a property in the country or a rental agreement of at least 12 months.\nThey put a lot of time and energy into choosing which town to live in, eventually settling on the small town of Marinha Grande, located on the Silver Coast close to famed surfing beach Nazare.\nWilson explains that they were keen to move somewhere that they could integrate themselves into the local community and spend time with Portuguese people rather than other Americans.\n“Many people moving to Portugal like to call themselves ‘expats’ and spend their time at ‘Meetups’ where they can whine to other ‘expats’ about how no one in Portugal speaks English, how they can’t find their exact brand of tinned beans and accuse the ‘natives’ of being impossible to get to know,” she says.\n“This was not the life we wanted. We wanted to be immigrants, people moving to a new country to become a part of their culture and community.”\nOnce their visa had been approved and border restrictions had lifted, the couple moved to Marinha Grande, which has a population of just under 40,000, in January 2022.\nThey initially stayed in an Airbnb, which cost them around $800 per month, and soon found themselves hosting some of the friends they’d connected with via a town Facebook page before traveling over.\n“I was cooking dinner out of our Airbnb two or three times a week for my Portuguese friends,” says Wilson, before adding that they were warmly received by the locals, who seemed intrigued by them.\n“People never pegged us as Americans,” says Wilson. “I think they can’t peg us at all. We seldom get guessed as Americans, and we’re fine with that.”\nAs the couple began to settle into their new lives, Wilson, who describes herself as an “over-achiever,” struggled with having so much time on her hands.\n“Retirement’s been hard for me,” she admits. “Because I’m a ‘Type A’ person. My entire life has been work, work, work. I have a list and I live by the list.\n“And now it’s like, I don’t even know what day of the week it is. And that’s been a struggle.\n“But I’m in the right place for that. Because that’s kind of OK here. No one looks down at me because I’m not racing all over the world and achieving, achieving and achieving.”\nWilson and Bjork are both currently taking Portuguese language classes provided by the government. However, Wilson admits that she hasn’t found learning a new language easy.\n“Portuguese, the language is very hard,” says Wilson, explaining that she speaks Japanese and Spanish as well as “tourist German, Danish and French.”\n“I’m really good at languages. But Portuguese is a challenge to learn.\n“We don’t find it easy. We find it manageable. Some people, especially people our age, don’t find it manageable.”\nThe couple have also had to change the way that they approach people, particularly while asking for things at shops, after noticing that their direct manner wasn’t being received well.\n“My Portuguese friends taught me that you have to first recognize their humanity,” says Wilson.\nRelated article\nHow falling for a stranger she met on a beach led this woman to ditch the US for the French Riviera\n“And you do this by saying, ‘Good morning. How are you?’ And they say, ‘I’m well. Are you well?’ And once you’ve done that, it’s like a magic key that will open good service up to you.”\nWilson goes on to explain that she finds this attitude refreshing, as the focus is firmly on people and personal relationships.\n“Their ethic is not job first, or money first,” she adds. “Their ethic is family and leisure…\n“So that’s refreshing, to see people valuing relationships above the rat race. The rat died here. There’s no place for that.”\nWilson has warmly embraced the Portuguese way of life, particularly the focus on food, which has long been a big part of her life.\n“The people eat together all the time,” she says. “Sunday is considered family day. So there’s a big family meal at everybody’s mom or dad’s house and everybody gathers together and eats.\n“Portuguese women my age are always cooking. I’ve spent a lot of time with them learning Portuguese food.”\nWhile Wilson and Bjork had originally planned to use Portugal as a “jumping off point” to travel around the rest of Europe, they’ve been too busy dealing with all of the tasks that come with relocating to a new country to venture very far.\n“There’s a lot to it,” says Wilson. “From governmental stuff, getting your residency card. Then you have to transfer your driver’s license and find a car [if you drive].\n“You have to buy everything [for your house]. And you have to set up yourself with medical and utilities. Really, it’s a huge process.”\nWhen asked if she and her husband have found Portugal to be more affordable, Wilson points out that this is all relative to their own experiences, noting their Portuguese friends “push back a little” if they comment on how much cheaper things are, as it’s not necessarily cheap for them.\n“We made that mistake,” she admits. “When we first came, we were like, ‘Oh it’s practically free.’ And we had to quit doing that, because it was offending them [their friends].”\nShe points out that what seems very affordable to them, may not be to affordable to a Portuguese worker earning minimum wage.\n“A lot of people make minimum wage,” she adds. “So that being said… Yes. For Americans, it is cheaper to live here, if you don’t live in Lisbon, Porto or the Algarve.\n“Those places are like trying to live in San Francisco or Manhattan. Those are expensive cities.\n“So if you have your heart set on living in one of those places, you’re going to pay three times what we pay, probably. In rent, food, everything.”\nDuring their time in Portugal, the pair have adopted two rescue cats, grandly named Rainha Doce Florabela de Portugal and Rainha Joia Fofa Maria da Silva, through nonprofit organization The Kitten Connection.\nWilson will be making snacks for an upcoming fundraising event for the organization and has also been giving regular cooking lessons to a local teenager.\n“He loves Asian food and it’s not that easy to get here in Marinha Grande,” she explains. “So we got the idea of him learning from me.”\nShe and her husband regularly host dinner parties, including an annual Thanksgiving celebration, and attend local events, such as children’s concerts and sports games.\nBeing a part of such a close-knit community has been a dream come true for Wilson, who says that they nearly always bump into someone they know while out and about.\n“We have been here for over two years and grow happier every day with our decision,” adds Wilson.\n“We have a wealth of Portuguese friends who have helped us every step of the way and opened the doors to their homes and hearts to us.”\nWilson had become incredibly jaded by the political climate in the US before relocating, and was particularly concerned about gun violence.\n“I tell people, ‘We fled the country,” she says. “The way everything was heading… We felt outraged and enraged every minute of the day.”\nShe hasn’t been back for a visit since moving to Portugal and says she has no plans to ever return.\n“I will return to the US in an urn. Period,” she stresses. “There’s literally nothing that would compel me to return to the US.”\nWhile Wilson misses her family and friends, she says that she’s an adventurer at heart and never intended to spend the rest of her days in America.\nRelated article\nWhy this American woman has ditched the US for Portugal\n“Some people asked how I could leave my children or what my children think about it.” she says, stressing that her children are grown ups living their own lives.\n“And I have traveled my whole life on my own, leaving my children and my husband to travel for two weeks a year, every year. Just because it was that important to me.\n“And I’m a little bit of a bohemian type of person. So my kids expected nothing less than [me] going out this way. Doing something odd.”\nWilson and Bjork say that they’ve had “zero problems” since relocating to Portugal and couldn’t be happier.\nIn fact, things have gone so well that others are sometimes skeptical when they recount their experiences.\n“People are like, ‘You just see everything through rose-colored glasses.’ But everything is as perfect as I say,” says Wilson.\n“It has unfolded without any problems for us. It doesn’t happen that way for everyone – I know that. But I’m going to celebrate what we got. And we got a great experience.”\n",

    "content": "With the Los Angeles Clippers' early playoff exit at the hands of the Dallas Mavericks on Friday night, it has left Los Angeles staring directly into a potentially grim reality. Once again, injuries were the narrative of their season but this time, the organization may have drastic changes coming. Stars Paul George and James Harden could both leave the team in free agency, even if reports say that the organization wants to keep them together.\nHarden is an actual free agent, with George needing to decline his player option to become one. Harden has become somewhat of a negative asset to his teams over the years, even if he put together a good showing with the Clippers this season.\nLos Angeles will need to decide if they want to commit long-term to this unit, which includes retaining Harden despite his poor playoff struggles again.\nIf Harden does leave the Clippers, there will be interested teams. Here are five potential landing spots for the former MVP this summer.\n1. Los Angeles Clippers\nIn most scenarios, Harden will end up back with the Clippers. However, nothing is a forgone conclusion within the NBA. But the veteran guard seemed happy to be in his hometown.\nHarden said after Game 6 that he wasn't sure what he would do regarding his contract. But he would probably prefer to stay with the Clippers if possible.\n\"I don't even know,\" Harden reflected postgame, per Ohm Youngmisuk of ESPN. Harden finished with 16 points, 13 assists and seven rebounds Friday but missed all six of his three-point attempts. \"You are asking a lot of questions that I don't have the answer to or haven't even thought about.\"\nHarden wasn't a full distraction for this Clippers team, something he has had issues with in the past. Unless something drastic happens, such as contract negotiations go south, expect Harden to be back with the Clippers next year.\n2. San Antonio Spurs\nThe Spurs were once a proud organization and the class of the NBA. But multiple poor seasons in a row have left them reeling and searching for any sign of hope. Landing the No. 1 pick in the 2023 NBA Draft last season has seemed to do the trick and Victor Wembanyama looks like the next NBA superstar.\nPairing Harden up with Wembanyama could be scary for the rest of the league. The pick-and-roll offense alone would be lethal, creating relevance for the Spurs once again. San Antonio may need to make some moves to open more cap space up to outright sign the former MVP or they could try to pull a sign-and-trade with the Clippers.\n3. Orlando Magic\nThe Magic are still in the playoffs, currently preparing to face off in a Game 7 against the Cleveland Cavaliers. But Orlando has grown up a lot this season. They still need a point guard to help run the offense and Harden could be the missing piece for them.\nPairing up with young sensation Paolo Banchero could be interesting, giving the Magic more credibility within the Eastern Conference. Orlando should have plenty of cap space to work with this summer, opening the door to them landing Harden without giving anything up.\n4. New Orleans Pelicans\nNew Orleans was swept out of the postseason by the Oklahoma City Thunder this season and changes are likely coming to them as well. The Pelicans could use a more true point guard to take guard CJ McCollum off the ball, potentially opening the door for Harden to come in.\nThe Pelicans would likely need to make a trade to land Harden so a sign-and-trade may be possible. In the event that George departs the Clippers, maybe they'll look to New Orleans for Brandon Ingram. A swap of Harden for Ingram, with some extra pieces included, could work out well for both sides.\nEvan Sidery of Forbes reported that New Orleans isn't likely to offer Ingram a contract extension and that they could move him this summer. Landing Harden would be a financial commitment for the Pelicans but not as much if they were to extend Ingram.\nNew Orleans would get a point guard who can facilitate the offense around Zion Williamson, and the Clippers would replace George with a younger, more lengthy forward. It could be a win-win for both sides if the normally disgruntled Harden has his eyes set on New Orleans.\n5. Houston Rockets\nJust last season, the Rockets were one of the top landing spots for Harden, but nothing ever materialized. Could Houston look to their former star to once again help lift them forward?\nIt's possible but unlikely. The biggest hurdle was Rockets head coach Ime Udoka not being too big of a fan of bringing Harden back.\n\"Nothing against James,\" Udoka told Zach Lowe of ESPN, \"but Fred is just a better fit. I coached James in Brooklyn. He's one of the smartest players I've ever been around. The words 'Ime doesn't want James' never came out of my mouth. It was, 'Let's look at the best fit.'\nThe Rockets have created a strong culture without him so going back to him could ruin that. Houston is never out of the running when it comes to Harden but it's the least likely from this list of teams.\n",

    "publishedAt": "7:00 AM EDT, Tue April 30, 2024",
    "content": "Aimee Nezhukumatathil is not one to sugarcoat the past.\nTake vanilla, for example — that heady, aromatic stem taking you back to sickly sweet children’s birthday cake or that scented lotion you had as a teen. But Nezhukumatathil writes about baking with her young son, creating vanilla extract with vodka to give as gifts, carefully scraping the seeds out of their pod with the dull side of a knife. The essay — one of 40 in her new book, “Bite by Bite” — isn’t just about her son, or vanilla. It’s also about Edmond Albios, an enslaved boy who discovered a new way to pollinate the vanilla orchids in a way that changed the vanilla industry. Vanilla is the vehicle through which her parallels are drawn.\n“Bite by Bite,” out on April 30, is poet Nezhukumatathil’s seventh book. It’s her second of prose, following the success of 2020’s “World of Wonders.” And, most notably, it’s her love letter to food. Each chapter of “Bite by Bite” focuses on a food — everything from apples to butter to the Filipino dessert halo-halo.\nBut these chapters, these essays, are not recited histories of ingredients or dishes. Instead, Nezhukumatathil weaves a personal memoir through food. In the chapter “Tomato,” she writes about her mother and grandmother — juxtaposing the path of the tomato from Spain to the Philippines and from Portugal to India with her own ancestry. “Lychee” is an ode to her Asian American writer community in New York. “Shave Ice” eulogizes female friendship.\n“I wanted to celebrate how delicious a full life could be,” Nezhukumatathil told CNN in a recent interview.\nBut, like with vanilla, that deliciousness doesn’t always mean sweet. There are sad tales here, too, dark histories underlying warm memories. Nezhukumatathil doesn’t waver. Food can be a map toward home, toward memory, toward lineage, her book argues. And with it, she beckons us to explore.\nCNN’s conversation with Nezhukumatathil has been edited for length and clarity.\nSo much of your writing brings the delights and oddities of nature to the forefront, but what made you turn your microscope to food specifically?\nThe majority of it (the book) was written in 2021, so although I did start a few essays before the pandemic, most of it was after the pandemic.\nI think after a time of being so separate, and having leaders who want to divide us so much, I wanted to focus on what nourishes us and also what can bring us back together. And for me, that was food.\nOne of the things I missed so much, I think so many people did, is being able to sit with our families, our loved ones around the table. There’s so many books that are the search for home.\nThis is a search for what kinds of homes we can make with food. There’s chosen family, there’s family, and there’s our birth family, and all of our friends and everything in between. Our crushes and our exes, and all of that. But food is one big connector, so I really wanted to focus in on that.\nYeah, this topic gets talked about a lot — how food can hold memory or be a cultural tie. But you talk about the origins of food — not just food as a connector between me and somebody else, but foods’ own history, like, the etymology of cinnamon or the origins of the Concord grape. How did you go about researching and thinking about food in that way?\nThe simple answer is I’m just a giant nerd. So many of these things I actually modeled from my parents. Since I was a little kid, I would always watch them asking questions of the grocery store or the different markets we were at — farmers markets and things like that. I would watch how they garden. They also had vast knowledges of mangoes, of course, for both of their countries, India and the Philippines. So they always modeled the sense of curiosity for me.\nIt wasn’t like I sit down and say, ‘I will research the origin of sugar,’ but rather I cannot eat sugarcane without what little I was taught about the horrors of the sugarcane trade as a global history. We have a little Christmas Eve tradition in my family about sugar cane. I couldn’t write about that and ignore the not so great origin stories of some of these ingredients and vegetables and fruits and meals.\nWhat I wanted was to make you slow down and think about what are the stories that connect, and I think that learning that way of thinking about your own life becomes contagious. Like hey, I thought I knew apples but did you know this or did you make this connection, and maybe my story of eating a gyro sandwich might make you think of a time when you missed one of your parents or guardians, things like that. My hope is that curiosity becomes contagious for you as well.\nYou mention eating a gyro sandwich. While I was reading, I had expected natural ingredients. We’re going to talk about fruit, we’re going to talk about vegetables. I was really surprised at some of the inclusions of lumpia and gyros and risotto and flan and all of these other things that you also talk about. What made you incorporate those elements alongside the more raw ingredients?\nIt’s so funny that you mentioned that, because that was a source of much distress for me. When I was thinking about it, and just looking at my home library, my local library, at bookstores — almost every food book is like, here’s a book on desserts. Here’s a book of vegetables, or here’s snacks. Here’s a book all on chocolate. I didn’t want to write anything first of all that was like anything else that was on the bookshelf.\nThe Table of Contents came about because I was thinking of instances in my life when I felt connected to people, and so I was thinking of scenes first and food second in some ways. Because I wanted to have that overall. I wanted to start and end this book with love.\nI was thinking of scenes first and food second … I wanted to start and end this book with love.\n\nIt was more of like, the feeling and the scenes were important to me, and then I had to go back and say like, ‘Okay, what fruit encompasses this?’ ‘What food encompasses this feeling?’ What was going on in the scene that made me feel so welcome, or not welcome, you know? Or uncomfortable, a little bit. I was really concerned about the emotion and location of what was going on rather than, I have to make a nice, neat, orderly Table of Contents of all sweet things, or all vegetables and just vegetables. I didn’t want it to be like a memoir in vegetables. So although I’m sure that book exists somewhere, it just wasn’t for me, you know?\nRight. But you also highlight some of the darker origins of some of these ingredients, like, in the “Vanilla” chapter, the enslaved child discovering how to pollinate vanilla orchids. Was that something you always intended to do?\nI read a lot for this book. And I definitely, in the back, included all the books that I was looking at. I did not know that I really was going to be writing about vanilla and my son, and it was absolute coincidence that I came across like oh the person that made vanilla what it is, was a young boy too.\nI really wanted to kind of celebrate, again what nourishes us, what brings us together. And part of that is facing some not-so-great moments of the past as well. I just wanted to be as honest as possible. And yet I didn’t want to linger on that kind of past I wanted to, again, have each essay begin and end with a note of love.\nIs there anything about your own relationship with a certain food that you didn’t think about before that you discovered while you were writing?\nI wanted to collect a gathering of essays that showcase different facets of being who I am on the cusp of 50. I wanted to celebrate childhood. I wanted to celebrate the exuberance and the exhilaration of meeting my girlfriends downtown in New York City when I was single, and happy. I also didn’t want it to be like, oh, a man rescued me.\nYet, there’s also been kind of a lot of books about how terrible some men are in marriage, and also like, kids are encroaching on me being an artist. That’s definitely some people’s experiences for sure. And I don’t want to negate that. But for this book, I wanted to showcase in particular for women of color, there are other ways of making it through. You do not need to have a dramatic fight. You do not need to have a jerk of a husband. You can actually like spending time with your kids and like spending time with your husband and also really enjoy your chosen family as well. You know what I mean?\nThere’s different food books that showcase, ‘Look at me finding myself’ or ‘look at me now that I have a family.’ Or, like ‘I’m a mom,’ ‘look at me now that I’m newly divorced.’ I wanted to celebrate all of it.\nYeah, there’s that trope of diaspora poetry and the trauma in that — not to say those things are not valid, but in your work you almost invite the reader into your world and into your family in a way you don’t see, particularly in writing.\nWe are not the perfect family, I make plenty of mistakes and mess up a lot. But what it comes down to is that I like spending time with my family. I truly do and, and I also love spending time teaching. You don’t have to choose one or the other.\nWe are not the perfect family, I make plenty of mistakes and mess up a lot. But what it comes down to is that I like spending time with my family.\n\nSometimes I am kind of a hot mess, and other times, it’s like, Hey, we’re gonna do takeout because mama has a deadline or dad has a deadline. But I think it’s also really important for people to see possibility. To see, hey, there’s another narrative out there of how to live rather than kind of these tired tropes that we see like, ‘I’m desperately embarrassed of my food, but now, I’m not’ you know, it’s just a work in progress.\nYou include some writing food prompts at the end of the book. What spurred you to do that?\nOne thing that occurred during really all of my books, but in particular with the last one ‘World of Wonders,’ is that so many people — and I don’t know if it’s because it was released during the pandemic or what — but so many people let their guard down and were a little bit more vulnerable with me in book signing lines, in zoos, in just straight up email and letters to me, saying how much they wanted to get back to writing. Or they used to write, but they didn’t know where to begin, they don’t have time.\nI just recently taught a class in San Antonio where there were two young mothers and I could hear the kind of the pain and nervousness in their voice, I get choked up thinking about it, saying like, ‘I don’t know who I am anymore. I used to be so creative, and I don’t know what to do. But your book makes me want to do something,’ you know, that kind of thing.\nAnd so I just I wanted to help all those hundreds and hundreds of people who have asked me like, I don’t know where to begin to write. So I designed these over 20 years of teaching at the college level and elementary school level, and grad students and senior citizens in high school. I compiled a selection of writing prompts to get — hopefully at least one of them, but hopefully all of them — your imagination going and get you to slow down and contemplate your life and your relationship to food.\nYou don’t have to publish them. You can but you can just write in a journal and nobody needs to see it. But there is a way to help those folks who wanted a place to start and it seems overwhelming. And I’m here to say it’s not; to start small with these prompts.\n",

    "content": "Paramount Global on Monday parted ways with its chief executive, Bob Bakish, in a seismic move that sent reverberations through the media conglomerate as it actively engages in acquisition talks with Skydance Media.\nIn place of Bakish, who led the company since controlling shareholder Shari Redstone reunited Viacom and CBS Corporation under one roof in 2019, will be a triumvirate of leaders: Brian Robbins, chief executive of Paramount Pictures; Chris McCarthy, chief executive of Showtime and MTV Entertainment Studios; and George Cheeks, chief executive of CBS.\n“The Board and I thank Bob for his many contributions over his long career, including in the formation of the combined company as well as his successful efforts to rebuild the great culture Paramount has long been known for. We wish him all the best,” Redstone said in a statement.\nThe team of three leaders will guide the company in the interim as Paramount’s board negotiates a deal with Skydance, which is led by David Ellison, son of the billionaire Larry Ellison, ending the Redstone family’s control of the company, which has produced blockbuster franchises including “Top Gun,” “Star Trek” and “Transformers.”\nThe relationship between Redstone and Bakish had become frosty in recent months, people familiar with the matter told CNN. Redstone and other board members took issue with Bakish’s strategic decisions, including not offloading the premium cable channel Showtime and striking a deal to sell BET.\nThe critical view of Bakish came as Paramount, with its heavy reliance on the cable television business, found it increasingly difficult to maintain profits amid the rapid industry transition to streaming. Shares of Paramount’s stock (PARA) have dropped nearly 50% over the last year.\nWhile legacy media companies have struggled immensely in recent years, Paramount, with its vast portfolio of cable outlets including Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central, was greatly exposed to shifting consumer habits with millions of people abandoning cable each year in favor of services like Netflix.\nIn an attempt to stave off declining cable revenues, Paramount has spent billions of dollars building its own streaming service, Paramount+. But like the platforms of other legacy media companies, it has struggled to gain the necessary traction to supplement linear losses. Part of the challenge for Paramount is its content library is simply not deep enough to persuade enough customers to purchase a monthly subscription in what has become a crowded space. On Monday, the company reported its paid subscriber base had grown to 71.2 million subscribers.\nSupporters of the Skydance deal hope that merging Paramount with the Ellison-led company will change its fortunes. Skydance has promised to invest heavily in a combined company, infusing at least $3 billion in cash to pay down debt and purchase stock, a person familiar with the matter told CNN.\nSkydance made its “best and final” offer to Paramount on Sunday, the person said. The deal values Skydance at approximately $5 billion.\nThe offer aims to placate shareholders who have expressed concern with the deal on the table. Those shareholders have argued the deal primarily benefits Redstone and they have encouraged Paramount’s board to evaluate other options. The offer from Skydance would see the company purchase a swath of Paramount shares at a premium price, the person familiar with the matter explained.\nIf approved, the committee of Paramount executives would then lead the company until the deal is completed and a new permanent leadership team takes the helm. In addition to Ellison, a possible top executive for a merged Paramount-Skydance company would be Jeff Shell, the former NBCUniversal chief executive who was fired last year after a sexual harassment claim was lodged against him.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n",

    "content": "The US government on Thursday banned internet service providers (ISPs) from meddling in the speeds their customers receive when browsing the web and downloading files, restoring tough rules rescinded during the Trump administration and setting the stage for a major legal battle with the broadband industry.\nThe net neutrality regulations adopted Thursday by the Federal Communications Commission prohibit providers such as AT&T, Comcast and Verizon from selectively speeding up, slowing down or blocking users’ internet traffic. They largely reflect rules passed by a prior FCC in 2015 and unwound in 2017.\nThe latest rules show how, with a 3-2 Democratic majority, the FCC is moving to reassert its authority over an industry that powers the modern digital economy, touching everything from education to health care and enabling advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence.\nRelated article\nFCC rolls out mandatory ‘nutrition labels’ for internet providers’ plans\nWith Thursday’s party-line vote, the FCC redefined internet service as similar to legacy telephone lines, a sweeping move that comes with greater regulatory power over the broadband industry. And the FCC said it would step in to override state or local policies that conflict with the federal net neutrality rule.\nLeading FCC officials have said restoring net neutrality rules, and reclassifying ISPs under Title II of the agency’s congressional charter, would provide the FCC with clearer authority to adopt future rules governing everything from public safety to national security.\nSome of the issues the FCC will be further empowered to address after the change include spam robotexts, internet outages, digital privacy and expanding high-speed internet access, FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said when she first announced the proposal in September.\nOn Thursday, Rosenworcel added that the vote would also prevent internet providers from selling Americans’ personal data or sharing it with tech companies to train artificial intelligence models.\n“The action we take here is good for consumers, public safety, national security and network investment,” Rosenworcel said ahead of the vote.\nThe vote marks the latest twist in a years-long battle between regulators on the one hand, who say consumer protections are needed to ensure all websites are treated equally, and ISPs on the other who describe the rules as heavy-handed government intervention.\nFor years, consumer advocates have said that without net neutrality rules in place, ISPs would be free to charge websites and consumers extra fees — the equivalent of toll lanes for the internet — in order for some websites to be delivered faster than others. At a societal scale, that could give ISPs enormous power to shape what consumers can see and access on the internet, consumer groups say, and entrench their dominance in markets that lack competition.\n“Broadband is a telecommunications service and should be regulated as such,” said Justin Brookman, director for technology policy at Consumer Reports. “The Title II authority will ensure that broadband providers are properly overseen by the FCC like all telecommunications services should be. Whether it is throttling content, junk or hidden fees, arbitrary pricing, deceptive advertising or unreliable service, broadband providers have proven over the years that without proper oversight, they will not hesitate to use their power to increase profits at the expense of consumers.”\nThe broadband industry argues there is no risk of that happening because consumers would revolt. ISPs add that during the Trump and Biden administrations when the net neutrality rules were not in effect, providers did not engage in that type of content-based network manipulation. They have also claimed that the regulations could discourage them from building high-speed networks, although some academic research has shown little support for that claim.\n“These 400-plus pages of relentless regulation are proof positive that old orthodoxies die hard,” said Jonathan Spalter, CEO of USTelecom, a trade association representing internet providers. “This is a nonissue for broadband consumers, who have enjoyed an open internet for decades. Rather than pushing this harmful regulatory land grab, policymakers should keep their eyes on the real-world prize of building opportunity for everyone in a hyperconnected world.”\nUS policies for network providers have flip-flopped multiple times over the past decade with every change in administration in Washington.\nRepublican commissioners at the FCC blasted Thursday’s vote, accusing its Democratic leadership of touching “the third rail of communications policy.”\n“The internet in America has thrived in the absence of 1930s command-and-control regulation by the government,” said FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, describing the new rules as a power grab. “The FCC has identified no gap in national security,” he added, that the agency’s move would help fill.\nIndustry groups are widely expected to challenge the rules in court, in a significant new test of the federal government’s power.\nIn past legal battles over net neutrality, courts have deferred to the FCC, ruling that it has wide latitude to regulate ISPs as it sees fit using the authority it derives from the agency’s congressional charter, the Communications Act of 1934.\nBut courts’ longstanding deference to expert agencies appears increasingly in doubt as a conservative-leaning Supreme Court has sounded an increasingly skeptical tone on the reach of federal executive authority.\nAs a result, the outcome of a legal challenge to the FCC’s net neutrality rules could have potentially broad ramifications for other US regulatory bodies, not just the FCC.\nThis story has been updated to clarify the FCC has previously said it would intercede in state and local policies that conflict with its net neutrality rule.\n",

    "content": "Can an iron structure stand tall for 1,600 years without rusting, despite being exposed to the elements?\nIt seems implausible, considering the supposed lack of technology at the time of its construction.\nYet, inside New Delhi’s UNESCO-listed Qutb Minar complex – a collection of historic monuments and buildings built in the early 13th century in the city’s southern Mehrauli district – one mysterious structure stands as a testament to this very enigma.\nVisitors to the courtyard of the complex’s Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque will immediately spot an imposing 7.2-meter, six-ton iron pillar with a decorative top that’s even older than the complex.\nRemarkably, the pillar is now as pristine as the day it was forged, defying both age and environmental adversities, including the Indian capital’s intense temperatures and increasing pollution. Dating back to the 5th century, its remarkable resilience continues to captivate travelers today.\nTypically, iron and iron alloy structures exposed to the air or moisture oxidize over time, rendering them coated in rust unless they are protected, like the Eiffel Tower, by layers of special paint. Scientists both in India and abroad began studying the iron pillar in Delhi in 1912 to try to figure out why it hadn’t corroded.\nIt wasn’t until 2003 that experts at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in the northern city of Kanpur cracked the mystery, revealing the answer in the journal Current Science.\nThey found that the pillar, primarily made of wrought iron, has a high phosphorus content (about 1%), and lacks sulfur and magnesium, unlike modern iron. Additionally, ancient craftsmen used a technique called “forge-welding.”\nThat means they heated and hammered the iron, keeping the high phosphorus content intact, a method uncommon in modern practices.\nArcheo-metallurgist R. Balasubramaniam, who authored the report, said that this unconventional approach contributed to the pillar’s enduring strength.\nRelated article\nIndia is a hiker’s dream destination. Here are a dozen of its most epic trails\nA thin layer of “misawite,” a compound of iron, oxygen and hydrogen, was also found on the pillar’s surface, he said. This layer is formed catalytically by the presence of high phosphorus in the iron and the absence of lime, thus further enhancing the pillar’s durability.\nBalasubramaniam lauded the metallurgists for their ingenuity, describing the pillar as “a living testament to India’s ancient metallurgical prowess.”\nIts durability is evidenced by historical accounts, including an incident in the 18th century when a cannonball fired at the pillar reportedly failed to break it, showcasing the impressive strength of this ancient monument.\nToday, the pillar serves as the emblem of scientific organizations like the National Metallurgical Laboratory and the Indian Institute of Metals.\nBeyond its metallurgical intrigue, the origin of the Iron Pillar is also veiled in mystery. One widely circulated account traces it back to the Gupta Empire, particularly under the reign of Chandragupta II, also known as Vikramaditya, around the 4th and 5th centuries.\nAccording to this tale, the pillar was erected in the Varah Temple of Udayagiri Caves, near Vidisha in Madhya Pradesh, as a victory monument dedicated to the Hindu deity Lord Vishnu. It’s said to have once borne a statue of Garuda, the mythical eagle mount of Vishnu, on its top, though this figure has been lost to history.\nAnother theory, proposed by heritage activist and educator Vikramjit Singh Rooprai, suggests it may have been bought by Varāhamihira, a renowned astronomer in the court of King Vikramaditya.\n“One of his books, the ‘Surya Siddhanta,’ details methods for calculating celestial positions, eclipses, and other astronomical phenomena - and it is believed that he used a tall pillar in his calculations,” says Vikramjit.\n“Therefore, upon his migration from Vidisha to Mihirapuri (now Mehrauli), where he founded an observatory, there exists a likelihood that he brought the pillar with him for continued use in his studies and calculations.”\nRelated article\nDevil’s dung or dinner delight? The story behind hing, one of India’s most divisive ingredients\nAdditionally, some historical records credit notable figures like Raja Anangpal of the Tomar dynasty, and Muslim rulers such as Iltutmish and Qutbuddin Aibek, for the relocation of the pillar to the Qutb complex.\nIt’s also been mentioned in the arts. In the epic poem “Prithviraj Raso,” penned by Chand Bardai, a courtier in the Chahamana dynasty under King Prithviraj Chauhan, the Iron Pillar holds great significance.\n“Bardai describes the Iron Pillar in Raso as a nail holding the Earth on the hoof of Sheshnag, the serpent king in Hindu mythology,” says Vikramjit.\n“Raso recounts how Raja Anangpal tried to uproot this nail despite warnings from Brahmins of dire consequences. When it was pulled out, revealing a red base believed to be Sheshnag’s blood, panic ensued, fearing Earth’s destruction. Anangpal quickly ordered its reinstallation, but it was not properly secured, resulting in it becoming loose. Thus, Bardai suggests that this incident inspired the colloquial name ‘Dilli’ for Delhi, which is a pun on the word ‘dhilli’, meaning ‘loose’ in Hindi.”\nAccording to one legend, if you stand with your back against the pillar and wrap your arms around it, making sure your fingers touch each other, your wish will come true – a tradition that imbues the pillar with spiritual significance beyond its historical value.\nHowever, the ASI (Archeological Survey of India) has put a fence around the pillar to minimize human impact.\nConservation architect and heritage expert, Pragya Nagar, finds the pillar’s preservation remarkable within the complex, despite the demolition and reconstruction of its surroundings over the years.\n“If we do look at the technique that was used to create the pillar from a fresh perspective, beyond mere acknowledgment of its ancient origins, we may discover avenues to leverage similar methods for the development of sustainable material alternatives, considering the environmental harm associated with processes like metal extraction,” she tells CNN.\n“It is imperative to look at history beyond relics and monuments that simply need to be conserved and marveled at, but as repositories of traditional knowledge and indigenous practices. This holistic approach has the potential to pave the way towards a more sustainable future.”\n",

    "content": "Imagine this scenario: a hospital interpreter receives an unexpected call informing her that her son's preschool teacher quit and they need to keep him home for the foreseeable future. She loved her job, it paid well, and she was essential in bridging communication gaps between patients and healthcare providers. But she had to leave that great job, and her son had to leave the school he loves, because the teacher couldn't afford to remain in the profession.\nThis scenario is far from isolated — many of the readers of this article have great former employees who left for similar reasons. It reflects a broader, systemic issue impacting countless families and, by extension, businesses across the nation. As business leaders, it underscores a critical question: how can we prepare to address our teams' childcare dynamics? How can we support our families and — in the process — build the economic resilience of our businesses?\nThe link between inadequate child care and economic strain is well-documented but bears repeating due to its substantial impact. A report by the Council for a Strong America reveals that the U.S. loses an estimated $122 billion annually due to childcare challenges that affect parents' ability to work effectively. This figure encapsulates lost earnings, diminished productivity, and reduced tax contributions. But the cost is not solely monetary — it also manifests in reduced workplace diversity and stifled professional growth, particularly among women who disproportionately bear the brunt of childcare shortages.\nAnd as the US Chamber Foundation notes: businesses are already paying for the lack of sufficient childcare. A survey highlighted in the report shows that 62% of employers cited child care as a reason they had lost employees from the workforce, and that doesn't even capture the costs of absenteeism or related stress. Beyond individual businesses, these disruptions ripple through every sector of the economy.\nThe opportunities for businesses investing in child care are robust. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation published a toolkit demonstrating how businesses can support child care for their employees (they have a lot of options), noting that businesses see very tangible benefits including reductions in absenteeism and increases in productivity. These benefits represent a fundamental improvement in the quality of work-life for employees, fostering a more committed and content workforce.\nMoreover, employees are just more likely to remain with an employer who actively supports their work-life balance, reducing recruitment and training costs associated with high turnover. An additional layer of benefit comes from enhanced company reputation. Businesses recognized for their supportive practices attract top talent and often see increased consumer favorability, which can drive sales and increase market share.\nThe benefits of child care support also extend into fostering a more inclusive workplace. By alleviating one of the key barriers to full workforce participation — especially for women and single parents — businesses promote diversity and equality. This not only enriches the workplace culture but also introduces a broader range of perspectives and skills into the organization, strengthening its adaptability and innovation capability.\nSo far we've focused on the short-term effects of child care on our teams. Investments in early childhood care and education also generate remarkably high long-term returns — ranging from enhanced educational achievements to longer-term economic productivity. Supporting the brain development of the next generation through evidenced-based 'serve-and-return' practices is not only an investment in children's potential but an integral strategy for securing a robust future economy.\nThis is all to say: our influence is not limited to our own companies. When business leaders share their perspectives on child care in the public sphere, they not only contribute to the policy debate but often steer it toward meaningful reform. Ever seen a legislator vote against something that is supported by both the Chamber of Commerce and Early Learning teachers? Me neither.\nWhile we may have influence, we also have competing priorities demanding our attention. If you want help from folks who make it easier to engage in this work, the Council for a Strong America has a coalition called Ready Nation, which is a group of business leaders advocating for early childhood investments.\nOur hospital interpreter's experience is not just a personal ordeal for her; it is a narrative echoing across the business landscape, calling for a reevaluation of how child care is integrated with workforce management. By recognizing the extensive benefits and acting on the business case for childcare support, companies can transform these challenges into strategic opportunities.\nIn doing so, they not only assist their employees and fortify their operations but also pave the way for a more resilient and thriving economic future. We have both a significant opportunity and a profound responsibility to advocate for and implement effective childcare support, rallying not just for the well-being of our enterprises but for the betterment of our communities.\n",

    "content": "Georgia’s parliament is set to pass a highly controversial so-called “foreign agents” bill that has triggered widespread protests across the former Soviet republic nestled in the Caucasus Mountains.\nTens of thousands of people in capital city Tbilisi have been protesting the legislation. Critics warn that it mirrors a foreign agents law already passed in Russia and could jeopardize Georgia’s bid to join the European Union.\nBut Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze has said the government is not planning any “substantial changes” to the bill, and has vowed to get it passed on Tuesday, when lawmakers in the former Soviet country are expected to vote.\nHere’s what you need to know about the proposed law and the uproar it has caused.\nThe bill would require organizations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as “agents of foreign influence” or face crippling fines.\nThe legislation was drafted by the Georgian Dream party, which along with its allies controls parliament. The proposal will receive a vote on Tuesday and it is expected to pass.\nGeorgia President Salome Zourabichvili called the bill “an exact duplicate” of its Russian counterpart in an interview with CNN.\nShe has vowed to veto the bill, but that won’t mean much. Georgia’s government is a parliamentary system, so Zourabichvili is effectively a figurehead. Real power lies with Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze. Georgian Dream’s billionaire founder, former Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, also wields significant political influence.\nA couple of reasons.\nThe proposed law is modeled after a similar one in Russia that the Kremlin has used to increasingly snuff out opposition and civil society. Many Georgians fear their foreign agents bill will be used to the same way it has been in its northern neighbor: to quash dissent and free expression by going after nongovernmental organizations with financial ties overseas.\nGeorgian Dream contends the legislation will promote transparency and national sovereignty and has hit back at Western criticism over the proposal.\nBut the law’s possible passage has touched on a more existential question: whether Georgia’s future lies with Europe or Russia.\nGeorgia has, like Ukraine, been caught between the two geopolitical forces since achieving independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.\nMany Georgians feel deep hostility toward the Kremlin, which invaded Georgia in 2008 and occupies about 20% of its internationally recognized territory – about the same proportion that Russia occupies in Ukraine.\nGeorgian Dream has long been accused of harboring pro-Russian sympathies, especially given that Ivanishvili made his fortune in the Soviet Union.\nPassionately. So much so that lawmakers at one point came to blows over the bill.\nPolling shows that about 80% of Georgians support joining the European Union rather than drifting further into the Kremlin’s orbit, and many of those in favor of deepening ties with the West have taken to the streets.\nCNN's Anna Coren speaks to Giorgi Revishvili about Georgia's foreign agents bill, known to critics as the so called \"Russian law.\"\nRelated video\nExplaining the controversy surrounding Georgia’s foreign agents bill\nMass demonstrations against the bill in Tbilisi have been going on nightly for a month. About 50,000 people came out Sunday evening in the capital, which is home to about 1 million people, to speak out against what they’ve dubbed “the Russian law.”\nThere have been counter-protests as well. One saw the reclusive Ivanishvili deliver a rare speech to a crowd of supporters bussed in to Tbilisi from Georgia’s rural regions, where Georgian Dream enjoys more support.\nThe address showed deep paranoia and an autocratic streak. Ivanishvili claimed that Georgia was being controlled by “a pseudo-elite nurtured by a foreign country” and pledged to go after his political opponents after October’s elections.\nYes, just last year.\nGeorgia’s government tried to pass the same law but was forced into an embarrassing climbdown after a week of intense protests, which saw citizens waving EU flags buffeted back by water cannons.\nThe bill was reintroduced in March, about a month after Kobakhidze became Prime Minister. This time, authorities seem determined to push the legislation through.\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan wrote on X that Washington is “deeply alarmed about democratic backsliding in Georgia.”\n“Georgian parliamentarians face a critical choice – whether to support the Georgian people’s Euro-Atlantic aspirations or pass a Kremlin-style foreign agents’ law that runs counter to democratic values,” he said. “We stand with the Georgian people.”\nThe Kremlin has claimed that the law was being used to “provoke anti-Russian sentiments,” adding that protests against it were being stirred by “outside” influences.\n“This is now the normal practice of a huge number of states that are doing everything to protect themselves from outside influence, from foreign influence on domestic politics. And all countries are taking action in one form or another, but all these bills have the same goal,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in April. “Once again, there is no way to link this bill and the desire to secure Georgia’s internal politics with some kind of Russian influence; this is not the case.”\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement earlier this month that she was following the developments in George with “great concern” and reiterated Brussels’ unease over the law.\n“Georgia is at a crossroads. It should stay the course on the road to Europe,” she said.\nDefinitely.\nGeorgia first applied for EU membership in 2022 and was granted candidate status in December, an important but still early step in the process of becoming a member of the bloc. However, Brussels said last month that the law’s passage would “negatively impact” Georgia’s path to EU membership\n“Georgia has a vibrant civil society that contributes to the country’s successful progress towards EU membership. The proposed legislation would limit the capacity of civil society and media organizations to operate freely, could limit freedom of expression and unfairly stigmatize organizations that deliver benefits to the citizens of Georgia,” EU officials said.\n“The EU urges Georgia to refrain from adopting legislation that can compromise Georgia’s EU path, a path supported by the overwhelming majority of Georgian citizens.”\nCNN’s Anna Chernova contributed to this report.\n",

    "content": "The Biden administration has assessed that Israel has amassed enough troops on the edge of the city of Rafah in Gaza to move forward with a full-scale incursion in the coming days, but senior US officials are currently unsure if it has made a final decision to carry out such a move in direct defiance of President Joe Biden, two senior administration officials told CNN.\nOne of the officials also warned that Israel has not come anywhere close to making adequate preparations – including building infrastructure related to food, hygiene and shelter – ahead of potentially evacuating more than one million Gazans are who currently reside in Rafah.\nIf Israel were to proceed with a major ground operation into Rafah, it would be going against months of warnings from the US to forego a full-scale offensive into the densely populated city. Biden himself voiced that warning in his most explicit terms yet last week, telling CNN’s Erin Burnett that the US would withhold some additional arms shipments to Israel if they were to take such a step.\n“The president was clear that he would not supply certain offensive weapons for such an operation were to occur,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters at the White House Monday. “It has not yet occurred.”\nAs the war enters its eighth month, US officials are increasingly questioning Israel’s approach to the war, including publicly suggesting it is unlikely to achieve its stated aim of destroying Hamas and eliminating its leadership.\nOn Monday, Kurt Campbell, the State Department’s number two official, said there have plainly been tensions between the two countries on “what the theory of victory is.”\n“Sometimes when we listen closely to Israeli leaders, they talk about mostly the idea of some sort of sweeping victory on the battlefield, total victory. I don’t think we believe that that is likely or possible,” Campbell said, in a seeming allusion to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s repeated references to a “total victory.” “We view that there has to be more of a political solution. That’s one of the reasons why the president’s team has been so engaged with the surrounding region,” Campbell said at the NATO Youth Summit co-hosted by the Aspen Institute.\nGoing “headlong into Rafah” could have dire consequences, Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned on Sunday.\n“Israel’s on the trajectory, potentially, to inherit an insurgency with many armed Hamas left, or, if it leaves, a vacuum filled by chaos, filled by anarchy and probably refilled by Hamas,” Blinken said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\nAnd though the US believes Israel will be unable to completely destroy Hamas, the administration believes Israel has achieved many of its initial war aims. State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said last week that Hamas has been “significantly degraded.”\n“You have seen their ability to launch the kind of attacks that they did on October 7 significantly degraded, if not completely eliminated,” he said. “They couldn’t launch an attack of that scale today.”\n“Their weapons production factories underground have been eliminated. Most of their battalion leadership in the north and in central Gaza has been eliminated. So Israel has achieved a great number of its military objectives,” he continued.\nIt remains unclear whether senior Hamas leaders are present in Rafah, but the US is continuing to assist Israel in its mission of trying to eradicate as many senior members as possible, including by providing significant intelligence assistance in trying to track down figures including Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’s leader in Gaza.\nAs Biden continues to call for Israel and Hamas to reach a temporary ceasefire and hostage release agreement, in private, senior US officials have not gone as far as to urge Israel to consider a permanent end to the fighting, according to the senior administration official. However, the Biden administration has been ramping up the pressure on Israel to start focusing much more in earnest on post-war Gaza plans – so far, to little effect.\nIsrael’s lack of interest on the so-called “day after” plans has been a source of growing frustration for Biden advisers, according to one of the senior administration officials, who went as far as to describe Israel as displaying the attitude of believing that post-war Gaza is somebody else’s problem to figure out.\nIn public and in private, this official said, Israel has offered no clear views on two major questions: post-war governance and who would oversee the strip’s security whenever the war eventually comes to an end.\nBlinken publicly called on Israel to engage more seriously on developing a plan for post-war Gaza over the weekend. So far, the engagement has been sorely lacking, Blinken said.\n“We’ve been working for many, many weeks on developing critical plans for security, for governance, for rebuilding. We haven’t seen that come from Israel,” Blinken said on CBS. “We’ve been working with Arab countries and others on that plan. We need to see that too. We have the same objective as Israel. We want to make sure that Hamas cannot govern Gaza again.”\n",

    "content": "Scientists have made a breakthrough in our understanding of how memories form in the brain and how this process may be disrupted by not getting enough sleep.\nThe findings offer exciting insights into how our brains work and may lead to new targeted treatments to improve memory formation in the future.\nGetting enough sleep is essential for our mental and physical well-being. It helps us consolidate our memories and aids physical recovery, and not getting enough has been shown to contribute to heart disease, obesity, neurodegenerative disorders and depression.\nNow, new research suggests that not getting enough sleep might permanently disrupt the formation and retrieval of waking memories.\nThe neurons that make up the \"wires\" in our brains rarely act alone. Instead, they are highly interconnected and often fire together in rhythmic and repetitive patterns. One example of this rhythmic firing is known as the sharp-wave ripple, which is sort of like a \"stadium wave\" in your brain.\nPrevious research has shown that sharp-wave ripples in an area of the brain called the hippocampus play an important role in memory retrieval and consolidation. However, the impact of sleep deprivation on these brain patterns is less well understood.\nIn a new study, published in the journal Nature, researchers from the University of Michigan Medical School recorded brain activity in the hippocampus of seven rats as they explored mazes over the course of several weeks. Some animals were regularly disturbed during sleep while others were allowed to sleep freely.\nBoth groups of mice showed similar levels of sharp-wave ripple activity. In fact, they were actually slightly higher among the group of sleep-deprived rodents. But the firing of these ripples in the sleep-deprived group was weaker and less organized than the patterns observed in the brains of the well-rested rats.\nThe sleep-deprived rats were then given two days to recover and demonstrated improvements in strength and organization of the sharp-wave ripple activity. However, they were unable to reach the same levels of activity as the rats with normal sleep schedules. In other words, sleep deprivation permanently altered the rats' ability to process specific memories.\n\"The memories that are formed prior to sleep deprivation will not undergo the same memory processing as those before sleep,\" lead author Kamran Diba, told Newsweek. \"Other studies from ours have previously shown that such memories won't be remembered in the same way.\"\nThis study adds to a growing body of evidence that memories continue to be processed after they are experienced, and that sleep appears to play a really important role in this processing. So pulling an all-nighter to revise before a big exam might not be a very effective strategy.\nNot only does this research highlight the importance of sleep in memory formation, but the team hopes that their findings may inform future strategies to stave off memory decline.\n\"One possibility is that if we can identify interventions that confer resilience to reactivation and replay (i.e. allow them to fully rebound during the eventual recovery sleep after sleep loss) then we may be able to circumvent memory decline, at least in the short term,\" Diba said.\nThis mechanism may also go some way to explain the associations we see between sleep deprivation and cognitive decline. \"While we did not investigate the case of chronic sleep deprivation, diminished reactivation and replay indeed represent a potential mechanism for cognitive decline, though I think there will likely be other links in the chain (such as protein signaling and gene expression),\" Diba said.\nIs there a health issue that's worrying you? Let us know via health@newsweek.com. We can ask experts for advice, and your story could be featured on Newsweek.\n",

    "content": "They’d always planned to retire somewhere outside the US, but when the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020, Cynthia Wilson and her husband Craig Bjork felt compelled to bring their plans forward.\nThe couple, who married in 2009, had already chosen Portugal as their intended destination after Googling “best places for Americans to retire to” and finding that the European country – a place Wilson had never visited – was high on the list.\n“It’s funny because I’ve been to like 33 countries, and almost all of northwest Europe,” Wilson, originally from Seattle, tells CNN Travel. “I’ve been to countries like Estonia, but I almost knew nothing about Portugal.\nThankfully, her husband, a former US marine, “knew everything about it.”\n“It was an ‘Aha’ moment for me,” says the retired chef and restaurant owner, explaining that Bjork was stationed in Lisbon during the late 1970s and “had regaled me with stories about his life there.”\nThe couple, who met when they were both in their 50s, initially bonded over their love for travel, and Wilson says that it’s been a “never ending conversation” ever since.\n“We started talking about our travels,” she recounts. “And we still are talking about our travels.”\nOnce they were married, Wilson and Bjork, who were based in Kansas at the time, began to think more seriously about the type of life that they wanted to have during their retirement years.\n“We were both watching our parents spend their entire savings and pensions on medical care,” says Wilson, explaining that they did a lot of research into the cost of living in Portugal and found it to be more favorable.\n“And, in Portugal, we could keep our money for travel. We were required to have private medical insurance as part of the visa process.\n“But we also would have access to the national system, particularly for hospitalizations.”\nWilson and Bjork, who previously ran a food truck named LumpiaPalooza and the Parsnipity Cafe in Wichita, Kansas, initially gave themselves six years “to plan and dream about moving to Portugal.”\nHowever, they opted to speed things up “rather than to go into debt to keep the business alive” during the pandemic.\n“We decided to retire two years early,” explains Wilson. “So we retired in 2020 and started the paperwork.”\nThe couple applied for a D7 visa, also known as the “Retirement visa,” which required them to meet specific requirements, including either proof of purchase of a property in the country or a rental agreement of at least 12 months.\nThey put a lot of time and energy into choosing which town to live in, eventually settling on the small town of Marinha Grande, located on the Silver Coast close to famed surfing beach Nazare.\nWilson explains that they were keen to move somewhere that they could integrate themselves into the local community and spend time with Portuguese people rather than other Americans.\n“Many people moving to Portugal like to call themselves ‘expats’ and spend their time at ‘Meetups’ where they can whine to other ‘expats’ about how no one in Portugal speaks English, how they can’t find their exact brand of tinned beans and accuse the ‘natives’ of being impossible to get to know,” she says.\n“This was not the life we wanted. We wanted to be immigrants, people moving to a new country to become a part of their culture and community.”\nOnce their visa had been approved and border restrictions had lifted, the couple moved to Marinha Grande, which has a population of just under 40,000, in January 2022.\nThey initially stayed in an Airbnb, which cost them around $800 per month, and soon found themselves hosting some of the friends they’d connected with via a town Facebook page before traveling over.\n“I was cooking dinner out of our Airbnb two or three times a week for my Portuguese friends,” says Wilson, before adding that they were warmly received by the locals, who seemed intrigued by them.\n“People never pegged us as Americans,” says Wilson. “I think they can’t peg us at all. We seldom get guessed as Americans, and we’re fine with that.”\nAs the couple began to settle into their new lives, Wilson, who describes herself as an “over-achiever,” struggled with having so much time on her hands.\n“Retirement’s been hard for me,” she admits. “Because I’m a ‘Type A’ person. My entire life has been work, work, work. I have a list and I live by the list.\n“And now it’s like, I don’t even know what day of the week it is. And that’s been a struggle.\n“But I’m in the right place for that. Because that’s kind of OK here. No one looks down at me because I’m not racing all over the world and achieving, achieving and achieving.”\nWilson and Bjork are both currently taking Portuguese language classes provided by the government. However, Wilson admits that she hasn’t found learning a new language easy.\n“Portuguese, the language is very hard,” says Wilson, explaining that she speaks Japanese and Spanish as well as “tourist German, Danish and French.”\n“I’m really good at languages. But Portuguese is a challenge to learn.\n“We don’t find it easy. We find it manageable. Some people, especially people our age, don’t find it manageable.”\nThe couple have also had to change the way that they approach people, particularly while asking for things at shops, after noticing that their direct manner wasn’t being received well.\n“My Portuguese friends taught me that you have to first recognize their humanity,” says Wilson.\nRelated article\nHow falling for a stranger she met on a beach led this woman to ditch the US for the French Riviera\n“And you do this by saying, ‘Good morning. How are you?’ And they say, ‘I’m well. Are you well?’ And once you’ve done that, it’s like a magic key that will open good service up to you.”\nWilson goes on to explain that she finds this attitude refreshing, as the focus is firmly on people and personal relationships.\n“Their ethic is not job first, or money first,” she adds. “Their ethic is family and leisure…\n“So that’s refreshing, to see people valuing relationships above the rat race. The rat died here. There’s no place for that.”\nWilson has warmly embraced the Portuguese way of life, particularly the focus on food, which has long been a big part of her life.\n“The people eat together all the time,” she says. “Sunday is considered family day. So there’s a big family meal at everybody’s mom or dad’s house and everybody gathers together and eats.\n“Portuguese women my age are always cooking. I’ve spent a lot of time with them learning Portuguese food.”\nWhile Wilson and Bjork had originally planned to use Portugal as a “jumping off point” to travel around the rest of Europe, they’ve been too busy dealing with all of the tasks that come with relocating to a new country to venture very far.\n“There’s a lot to it,” says Wilson. “From governmental stuff, getting your residency card. Then you have to transfer your driver’s license and find a car [if you drive].\n“You have to buy everything [for your house]. And you have to set up yourself with medical and utilities. Really, it’s a huge process.”\nWhen asked if she and her husband have found Portugal to be more affordable, Wilson points out that this is all relative to their own experiences, noting their Portuguese friends “push back a little” if they comment on how much cheaper things are, as it’s not necessarily cheap for them.\n“We made that mistake,” she admits. “When we first came, we were like, ‘Oh it’s practically free.’ And we had to quit doing that, because it was offending them [their friends].”\nShe points out that what seems very affordable to them, may not be to affordable to a Portuguese worker earning minimum wage.\n“A lot of people make minimum wage,” she adds. “So that being said… Yes. For Americans, it is cheaper to live here, if you don’t live in Lisbon, Porto or the Algarve.\n“Those places are like trying to live in San Francisco or Manhattan. Those are expensive cities.\n“So if you have your heart set on living in one of those places, you’re going to pay three times what we pay, probably. In rent, food, everything.”\nDuring their time in Portugal, the pair have adopted two rescue cats, grandly named Rainha Doce Florabela de Portugal and Rainha Joia Fofa Maria da Silva, through nonprofit organization The Kitten Connection.\nWilson will be making snacks for an upcoming fundraising event for the organization and has also been giving regular cooking lessons to a local teenager.\n“He loves Asian food and it’s not that easy to get here in Marinha Grande,” she explains. “So we got the idea of him learning from me.”\nShe and her husband regularly host dinner parties, including an annual Thanksgiving celebration, and attend local events, such as children’s concerts and sports games.\nBeing a part of such a close-knit community has been a dream come true for Wilson, who says that they nearly always bump into someone they know while out and about.\n“We have been here for over two years and grow happier every day with our decision,” adds Wilson.\n“We have a wealth of Portuguese friends who have helped us every step of the way and opened the doors to their homes and hearts to us.”\nWilson had become incredibly jaded by the political climate in the US before relocating, and was particularly concerned about gun violence.\n“I tell people, ‘We fled the country,” she says. “The way everything was heading… We felt outraged and enraged every minute of the day.”\nShe hasn’t been back for a visit since moving to Portugal and says she has no plans to ever return.\n“I will return to the US in an urn. Period,” she stresses. “There’s literally nothing that would compel me to return to the US.”\nWhile Wilson misses her family and friends, she says that she’s an adventurer at heart and never intended to spend the rest of her days in America.\nRelated article\nWhy this American woman has ditched the US for Portugal\n“Some people asked how I could leave my children or what my children think about it.” she says, stressing that her children are grown ups living their own lives.\n“And I have traveled my whole life on my own, leaving my children and my husband to travel for two weeks a year, every year. Just because it was that important to me.\n“And I’m a little bit of a bohemian type of person. So my kids expected nothing less than [me] going out this way. Doing something odd.”\nWilson and Bjork say that they’ve had “zero problems” since relocating to Portugal and couldn’t be happier.\nIn fact, things have gone so well that others are sometimes skeptical when they recount their experiences.\n“People are like, ‘You just see everything through rose-colored glasses.’ But everything is as perfect as I say,” says Wilson.\n“It has unfolded without any problems for us. It doesn’t happen that way for everyone – I know that. But I’m going to celebrate what we got. And we got a great experience.”\n",

    "content": "Indian weddings are notoriously elaborate affairs, requiring a multitude of outfit changes for multiple days of festivities.\nIt used to be normal for a family visiting Brij Kishore Agarwal’s sari shop, near the narrow lanes of Chandni Chowk market in India’s Old Delhi, to depart with a big bundle of bright, embroidered garments and leave behind a substantial pile of cash.\nWorries that someone would break in and steal the money before he could make a bank deposit kept the store’s now-79-year-old owner awake at night.\nThese days he sleeps easier, because almost all his customers use e-payments to complete their purchases.\n“I have seen this country change,” says Agarwal, who has worked in the shop for about 65 years. “We very rarely get cash payments.”\nDigital payments, made through systems like the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), which allow users to transfer funds instantly by scanning a QR code, have become ubiquitous across the world’s most populous country, transforming daily life.\nIn Delhi, tea sellers collect rupees via mobile apps, and tuk tuk drivers who pull over to buy parathas stuffed with steaming hot paneer pay with their phones.\nThe e-payment revolution is also likely to play an important role in India’s attempts to become an economic superpower. It is the planet’s fifth biggest economy, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is currently running for his third consecutive term, has said he wants India to be considered “developed” by 2047.\n“Digital payments are likely to enhance India’s growth by eliminating frictions, increasing efficiency, and reducing costs,” Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University, told CNN. “UPI and the broader digitization of the economy could also increase the inclusiveness of this growth,” he added.\nIndia’s push to digitize its society started about 15 years ago, but e-payments were slow to catch on. In 2016, 96% of transactions in India were still conducted with banknotes.\nTwo events that year changed things. First, the non-profit National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), an initiative of the central bank and a banking association, launched the payment infrastructure UPI.\nUPI allows users to use their phone as a virtual debit card, transferring money from almost 600 member banks and fintech companies instantly without entering bank details or paying transaction fees.\nLater that year, the government suddenly scrapped two large banknotes that comprised 86% of all currency in circulation, with the stated goal of fighting corruption. That prompted a surge in the use of e-payments.\n“We had no choice,” says Ramesh Kumar, 52, a towel shop owner in Delhi’s Sarojini Nagar Market, who started accepting digital payments in 2016.\nCovid-19 further boosted the adoption of digital transactions, as people tried to protect themselves from the virus.\nNow, Indians use UPI to pay everyone from vegetable vendors to doctors. More digital transactions are completed in India than any other country, according to the government. In 2023, the number of UPI transactions topped 100 billion.\nThere are some holdouts. Azeez, a 34-year-old rickshaw driver in Old Delhi, told CNN that he’s too scared of losing money to use e-payments.\n“I am [an] uneducated person, I am poor, I have never been to a school, I can’t read or write,” he says. “What if I make a mistake?”\nStill, the upward trend is expected to continue, further boosting the number and value of funds flowing into the formal economy. UPI is aiming for two billion transactions a day by 2030.\n“If I can, and my store, which is so old, can move forward and change like this, I am sure every buyer and customer will also do it,” says Agarwal, the sari seller.\nIndia is the world’s fastest-growing major economy and digitization “has played a fairly consequential role in the very successful economic trajectory that India is on,” says Prasad, who is the author of “The Future of Money: How the Digital Revolution Is Transforming Currencies and Finance.”\nAlthough it’s difficult to quantify the impact that UPI adoption has had on India’s gross domestic product, on a micro level it’s easy to see how it’s making a difference. Agarwal says it has increased efficiency and transparency for his business, and made filing taxes simpler.\nKapil Sharma, 42, who sells flowers for as little as $0.12 outside a temple in Old Delhi, told CNN he used to lose business because potential customers wouldn’t want to wait for change. He started using UPI about a year ago and has seen an uptick in sales.\n“It’s just simpler,” he says. “They buy, pay and go.”\nConvenience aside, India’s digital public infrastructure has helped it achieve an 80% financial inclusion rate. Although inequality remains a problem, Prasad says that digitization has “made Indian citizens, including the masses who are not very wealthy, feel that they have a stake in India’s economic growth and transformation.”\nNow NPCI is focused on expanding overseas to make it easier for citizens working abroad to send remittances home or allow Indian travellers to pay using UPI. This year, the Eiffel Tower’s website started accepting payment via UPI.\n“I think the government sees the UPI as a template for the rest of the world,” says Prasad. “I think it would certainly help India’s stature on the world stage.”\nNo matter its future impact outside India, UPI appears to have strong grassroots support from those who have already benefitted from it, which means its dominance in the South Asian nation is likely to grow.\n“If anyone gives me an option to go back to cash payment, I will just say I am not interested,” says Agarwal. “Please find a phone, download these apps, and use them.”\n",

    "content": "Nobody has anything nice to say about Michael Cohen.\nDonald Trump’s former fixer and lawyer is expected to take the stand Monday as the key witness in the Manhattan district attorney’s case against the former president, prepared to give testimony connecting to Trump the $130,000 hush money payment Cohen made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election.\nThrough three weeks of testimony, jurors have already heard plenty about Cohen through numerous witnesses, who have painted an unflattering portrait of an aggressive, impulsive and unlikeable attorney.\nDavid Pecker, former head of National Enquirer parent company American Media Inc., said Cohen was “prone to exaggeration.” Former Trump aide Hope Hicks said Cohen liked to call himself a “fixer” – a role she said was possible only because “he first broke it.” And Daniels’ former attorney Keith Davidson said he only worked with Cohen because he was a “jerk” whom Daniels’ then-manager Gina Rodriguez – along with everyone else – didn’t want to deal with.\n\n“Gina called me up to tell me that: ‘Some jerk called me and was very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me. And I, um, would like you, Keith, to call this jerk back,’” Davidson testified in the third week of the trial.\n“I hate to ask it this way, but who was that jerk?” asked Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass.\n“It was Michael Cohen,” Davidson responded.\nNow Cohen is the witness whom prosecutors are relying on to deliver testimony that can help them prove Trump falsified business records when he allegedly reimbursed Cohen for the $130,000 to Daniels to keep her from going public about a past encounter ahead of the 2016 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied the affair.\nCohen is the only witness who will testify about Trump’s alleged involvement in both the decision to pay Daniels and the plan to reimburse Cohen for advancing the money. Cohen will likely serve as the narrator for the prosecution and take the jury from the initial meeting in which Pecker, Cohen and Trump allegedly agreed to buy negative stories that could hurt Trump’s presidential run to the payment made to Daniels just days before Election Day to an Oval Office meeting in February 2017, just weeks after Trump was sworn in.\nProsecutors allege that during the February meeting, Trump and Cohen agreed how Cohen would be paid back. That arrangement, prosecutors say, included a false story that Cohen was working under a retainer agreement. The paperwork, from the invoices and general ledger entries to the checks signed by Trump, make up the 34 criminal charges in the case.\nProsecutors have waited to call Cohen until the end of their case, after introducing phone records, emails, text messages and bank records that they hope bolster his credibility with the jury. They have not tried to hide from the jury that he and other witnesses have plenty of problems.\n“We are going to be very up-front about the fact that several of the witnesses in this case have what you made might consider to be some baggage,” Steinglass told a panel of prospective jurors during jury selection.\nThe testimony will pit Trump against Cohen, who once said he would take a bullet for the former president. They last saw each other when Cohen testified in Trump’s New York civil fraud trial last fall. Cohen’s testimony was brief, but the showdown was tense.\nThis week the stakes are higher, with a potential criminal conviction and possible jail sentence on the line for Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.\nIt brings to a close a long journey for Cohen, who is still aggrieved that he served three years in prison and home confinement after pleading guilty to federal campaign finance charges related to the payoff, among other crimes.\nCohen met with prosecutors more than a dozen times and testified before the grand jury in the hush money trial. He has immunity on state charges for his role in the alleged conspiracy.\nHe will also face blistering cross-examination by Trump attorney Todd Blanche. The former president’s lawyers are expected to hammer at Cohen’s credibility, including digging into his past, and suggest to the jury that Trump had no idea what deal Cohen struck or how it was recorded on the books of his company.\n“Even before he takes the stand, Cohen has been attacked and undermined by the prosecution’s own witnesses. On one hand, he could be damaged goods before he takes the stand. But he also might benefit from low expectations if the jury finds him to be better than advertised,” said Elie Honig, a CNN senior legal analyst and former state and federal prosecutor.\nThe charges filed against Trump date to events that transpired during the 2016 election. But in many ways, the case against Trump stems from his former fixer’s decision to plead guilty in 2018 in federal court to two counts of making unlawful campaign contributions in violation of federal campaign finance laws. He implicated Trump directly in the scheme and admitted that he orchestrated to pay Daniels on Trump’s behalf.\nCohen also pleaded guilty to tax charges and to lying to Congress about Trump’s business venture to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison, which he served behind bars and under house arrest.\nCohen’s plea prompted the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office to launch the investigation surrounding the hush money payments that led to Trump’s indictment last year.\nCohen became dedicated to antagonizing Trump. He published two books, “Disloyal” in 2020 and “Revenge” in 2022, and launched a podcast, “Mea Culpa” – all of which spent plenty of time bashing Trump and cheering on his prosecution.\nOn social media, Cohen continued to attack Trump in the weeks leading up to the trial, and even after it began. The social media jabs reached the point that Judge Juan Merchan told prosecutors Friday to give Cohen a message “from the bench” that he should stop speaking about the case. (Merchan has said he cannot legally gag a witness.)\nTrump has often punched right back in interviews and on social media, including in several instances that violated the judge’s gag order on the former president barring discussion of witnesses in the case.\nBeginning with the first witness in the case, Pecker, jurors have heard criticisms from witness after witness of Cohen ahead of his own expected testimony.\nPecker, who met with Cohen and Trump at a key Trump Tower meeting in 2015, was asked by Trump attorney Emil Bove whether Cohen was “prone to exaggeration.”\n“Yes,” Pecker said.\nBove then asked Pecker whether he could not trust everything Cohen said. The judge sustained an objection to the question, telling Trump’s attorney in a sidebar discussion that it was not the right place to “impeach” Cohen’s credibility.\nMore witnesses would keep doing so anyway.\nCohen’s former banker, Gary Farro, then testified that he was specifically given Cohen’s account because he could be firm with individuals who “may be a little challenging.” Farro said it was fair to call Cohen an “aggressive guy.”\n“Anything he did need, he called me, and it was always something that was urgent,” the banker said.\nArguably the most negative assessment of Cohen came from Davidson, who negotiated the hush money deal with Cohen on Daniels’ behalf in 2016. Davidson described a 2011 conversation about a blog post on Daniels and Trump on thedirty.com, where Cohen unleashed a “barrage of insults and insinuations and allegations.”\n“I don’t think he was accusing us of anything. He was just screaming,” Davidson said.\nDaniels’ former attorney went on to explain how he ended up involved in the hush money deal, when Daniels’ manager asked him to help finalize the deal for a nondisclosure agreement.\nAsked why he got involved, Davidson said: “The moral of the story was: No one wanted to talk to Cohen.”\nDavidson recalled under questioning from Steinglass that after Trump was elected in 2016, he got a call in December from a “very despondent and saddened” Cohen.\n“He said something to the effect of: ‘Jesus Christ. Can you f**ing believe I’m not going to Washington? After everything I’ve done for that f**ing guy. I can’t believe I’m not going to Washington. I’ve saved that guy’s a** so many times, you don’t even know.’”\nOthers who didn’t interact with Cohen as much as Davidson didn’t have much better things to say. Jeff McConney, the former Trump Organization controller, was asked what Cohen’s position was at the company.\n“He said he was a lawyer,” McConney responded.\n“Did he work in the legal department?” asked prosecutor Matthew Colangelo.\n“I guess so,” McConney said derisively.\nAnd Hicks, who worked at the Trump Organization before becoming a key aide on the 2016 campaign, described to jurors how Cohen – Trump’s fixer – was prone to inflate his influence on the campaign.\n“There were times where Mr. Cohen did things that you felt were not helpful to what you were trying to accomplish, right?” Bove asked Trump’s 2016 campaign press secretary.\n“Yes,” Hicks responded. “I used to say that he liked to call himself ‘a fixer’ or ‘Mr. Fix It,’ and it was only because he first broke it that he was able to come and fix it.”\n",

    "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\nAncient DNA is spilling more secrets about the Avars, a fearsome people who built a mysterious empire that ruled much of Central and Eastern Europe for 250 years from the mid-sixth century.\nPrimarily known from the accounts of adversaries, the Avars confounded the Byzantines with formidable horseback warriors who appeared suddenly on their doorstep. The enigmatic nomads came en masse from the Mongolian steppe in what was one of the biggest and fastest long-haul migrations in ancient history.\nWith opulent graves but no written records, the empire and its people have remained largely in the shadows of history until recently. But a landmark April 2022 study involving ancient DNA taken from the graves of the Avar elite shed light on the empire’s far-flung origins.\nNow, a new study analyzing the remains of 424 people buried in four cemeteries unearthed in Hungary has revealed details about Avar family and social life and how the newcomers interacted with the population of their adopted homeland.\n“What surprised me most was the simple fact that these people in the cemeteries are so interconnected,” said Zsófia Rácz, a researcher at Eötvös Loránd University’s Institute of Archaeological Sciences in Budapest, Hungary. Rácz was a study coauthor of the latest report.\nThe researchers were able to build detailed family trees or pedigrees, the largest of which spanned nine generations across 2 ½ centuries. The team discovered that around 300 of the individuals had a close relative buried in the same cemetery.\nThe analysis showed that men stayed in their community after marriage, while women married outside their original community — a pattern known as patrilocality.\n“For all the mothers, we don’t find the parents. The parents aren’t at the site. While all the males are the descendants of the founders,” said Guido Alberto Gnecchi-Ruscone, lead author of the study that appeared Wednesday in the journal Nature.\nStudy of mitochondrial DNA, which reveals the female line, showed a high variability, suggesting that the women who married into the Avar groups were from different places, according to Gnecchi-Ruscone, a postdoctoral researcher of archaeogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. They still shared a “steppe” genetic ancestry, indicating that they were probably not conquered local people.\nWhat’s more, the study found, it was relatively common for both men and women in Avar society to have children with multiple partners.\nIn the case of men, researchers found two partners in 10 cases, three partners in four cases and four partners in one case. Having multiple wives may have been relatively common in the general population as well as the elite, the study authors wrote.\nThe team also uncovered multiple cases of closely related male individuals having offspring with the same female partner: three pairs of fathers and sons, two pairs of full brothers, and one sibling of paternal half brothers and an uncle and nephew.\nSimilar “levirate unions” that took place after the death of the woman’s husband existed in other Eurasian steppe societies, according to the study, and suggests that the Avars, who abandoned their nomadic way of life based on herding and became more settled shortly after arriving in Europe, clung to some aspects of their former way of life.\nLara Cassidy, a geneticist and assistant professor at Trinity College Dublin who was not involved in the new research, said the authors had “deftly unravelled” the organizing principles of this medieval society, providing “compelling evidence for a rigid patrilineal system, in which children belong to their father’s family and ancestry is traced from father to son.”\nWriting in a commentary published alongside the research, she largely agreed with the authors’ explanation for multiple reproductive partners.\n“Polygamy (having multiple marriage partners), serial monogamous marriages and extramarital relations are all possible explanations,” she said.\n“However, two cases of men with multiple older female partners, all middle-aged at death, makes a good argument for polygyny (having multiple wives). By contrast, most of the cases of women with multiple partners were apparent levirate unions, in which a widow would marry the son or brother of the deceased. This is a common custom in pastoralists … both providing for widows and obliging them to fulfil marriage contracts that are conditional on them bearing male heirs.”\nGnecchi-Ruscone said the biological continuity in the tight-knit population the researchers studied was striking, especially given that there was no sign of interbreeding between close blood relatives — a phenomenon known as consanguinity.\n“Even more distant interbreeding like (between) cousins or second cousins, it leaves traces genetically. And we see absolutely no consanguinity in these individuals,” he said.\n“This really tells us that they knew who their biological relatives were, and they traced their biological relatives over the generations.”\nIt wasn’t possible to understand the gender power dynamics of the community through the study of ancient DNA alone, Gnecchi-Ruscone said.\nBurials of men were more likely to include high-status grave goods such as horses, saddles and harnesses, Rácz said. However, women likely played a role in promoting social cohesion linking individual communities.\nCassidy said that the oral history of female-line genealogy may have been important for the Avars, ensuring that daughters did not take husbands from among their mothers’ or grandmothers’ kin.\nAvar graves — around 100,000 have been excavated so far — form an important part of Europe’s archaeological heritage.\nThe Avars were once part of what the Chinese called the Rouran khaganate or confederation of tribes, which the Turks defeated in 550, forcing the Avars to flee westward.\nTraveling more than 5,000 kilometers (3,100 miles) in a few years from Mongolia to the Caucasus, according to the 2022 study published in the journal Cell that pinpointed the group’s Asian ancestry, the Avars set up a base in what’s now Hungary and came close to crushing Constantinople, the center of the Byzantine Empire.\nSome historians credit the Avars with bringing the stirrup to Europe — a transformative technology that made mounted warfare possible and was subsequently widely adopted across the continent.\nRelated article\nAncient DNA reveals intriguing details about a sixth century Chinese emperor\nThe study was a “fruitful interweaving of genetics, history, and archaeology,” according to Bryan Miller, an assistant professor of Central Asian art and archaeology at the University of Michigan, who wasn’t involved in the study.\n“Many previous studies have purported to sweep across the entirety of Eurasia with a wide population, relying on one individual per community or a handful of individuals to represent an entire culture or society,” he said via email.\n“Instead, this study shows how only a data set with far greater resolution, with fuller investigations of whole communities, can provide the kinds of definitive or nuanced narratives that the earlier big data studies attempted to provide.”\n",

    "content": "Acclaimed Iranian filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof says he has fled his home country to an undisclosed location in Europe after a court in Iran sentenced him to prison on national security charges.\nRasoulof condemned the Iranian government in an Instagram post on Monday, calling it a tyrannical and oppressive regime, and posting a video that showed him crossing the country’s mountainous border.\n“If geographical Iran suffers beneath the boots of your religious tyranny, cultural Iran is alive in the common minds of millions of Iranians who were forced to leave Iran due to your brutality and no power can impose its will on it. From today, I am a resident of cultural Iran,” he said.\nIn a separate statement dated May 12, Rasoulof said he had decided to escape Iran after his lawyers told him his prison sentence would be implemented on short notice.\n“I had to choose between prison and leaving Iran. With a heavy heart, I chose exile,” he said in that statement, which was provided by a spokesperson.\nCNN has reached out to Iranian authorities for comment. His lawyer Babak Paknia said last week that an Iranian court had sentenced Rasoulof to eight years in prison and flogging after it found his films and documentaries to be “examples of collusion with the intention of committing a crime against the security of the country.”\nRasoulof is among several high-profile artists to have been caught up in a widening crackdown on dissent by Iranian authorities since nationwide protests broke out over the 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini, who was arrested for allegedly not wearing her headscarf properly.\nRasoulof, whose recent films have been critical of the Iranian government, was among a group of artists and filmmakers who signed a letter criticizing the violent response of security forces to quell a 2022 protest over a building collapse in the southwestern city of Abadan that killed more than 40 people.\nRasoulof won a Golden Bear for best film at the Berlinale festival in 2020 for “There Is No Evil” and his film “A Man of Integrity” was recognized for a “Certain Regard” honor at the Cannes Film Festival in France in 2017.\nRelated article\nIran sentences renowned director to 8 years in prison and flogging, lawyer says\nThe filmmaker’s latest work, “The Seed of the Sacred Fig,” is set to premiere at Cannes next week, but it’s unclear if he will be able to attend.\n“We are very happy and much relieved that Mohammad has safely arrived in Europe after a dangerous journey,” said Jean-Christophe Simon, the distributor for Rasoulof’s latest film.\nThe Films Boutique and Parallel45 executive added that he hopes that Rasoulof will be able to attend the Cannes premiere for his film “in spite of all attempts to prevent him from being there in person.”\nRasoulof said on Instagram that he will now work to quickly finish the last technical steps of his film’s post-production.\n“Many people helped to make this film. My thoughts are with all of them, and I fear for their safety and well-being,” he said, accusing the Iranian government of pressuring members of his production team with interrogations, court filings and travel restrictions.\nRasoulof didn’t specify how he escaped Iran, saying only that he did it secretly with the help of friends and acquaintances.\nIn 2022, an Iranian court sentenced Rasoulof to one year in prison and banned him from making films for two years on the charge of “propaganda against the system,” according to Human Rights Watch. Iranian authorities have previously arrested him multiple times and confiscated his passport because of his work, HRW said.\nAdditional reporting by Michael Rios\n",

    "content": "I got addicted to heroin in college via an OxyContin habit. It was hitting the streets strong. No one really knew what it was. We just knew that it was a pill, and since it was produced by a pharmaceutical company, we assumed it wasn't too nefarious.\nVery quickly, your tolerance for OxyContin jumps and soon your habit reaches hundreds of dollars a day. We discovered heroin was very similar but much cheaper, so I started using that instead.\nEventually, I was kicked out of school and damaged my personal relationships with friends and family by stealing or asking to borrow money.\nMy family had extensive experience with drug addiction. My parents were both heroin addicts. When they discovered that I was too, they had no room for enablement.\nThey said: \"Come to us when you're really serious, but you're on your own now.\"\nI had nowhere to go, so I ended up homeless on and off for years, addicted to heroin and crack cocaine. I committed a lot of crimes to fund my addiction, mostly property crime and theft against drug stores and supermarkets.\nIronically, I never got arrested for any of that, or for using drugs in public places or breaking and entering, even though I was doing it all the time.\nI got into a fight at a Panda Express in Los Angeles. Another homeless person mugged me there and stole my cell phone. We fought and I took out a knife and asked for my phone back.\nThe police came, and that's why I finally ended up going to jail. They tried to charge me with assault with a deadly weapon, and that was going to probably get me a year-and-a-half prison sentence, which I didn't mind.\nBut I didn't want the violent felony on my record. So my public defender worked a deal out with the judge where I would just receive a six-month sentence in lieu of probation.\nMy charges got dropped, but I still requested a six-month violation in exchange for ending my probation after that term.\nI'd been to jail many times but never for more than three or four days, always in a holding cell. This was my first time going in \"blues,\" meaning I had to wear a blue jumpsuit.\nI went to a dorm filled with 100 men either awaiting trial for prison or who had been sentenced already, but the system was so clogged they were serving their time in the county jail.\nI was prepared for jail. I'd been around people who had been to prison and jail who told me: \"If you're white, you have to join a gang. There's no riding solo. It's not a big deal; you just have to do it.\"\nWhen I arrived, it was very scary. There are the Black gangs, the Hispanic gangs, and the white gangs. Some people in the white gangs have swastikas and are pretty serious.\nI knew that I had to join the Peckerwoods, a notorious white supremacist gang. But I am by birth half-Jewish. I have a Jewish last name too, so I was fearful.\nMy plan was to pretend I was German since my last name is Yiddish, so pretty similar sounding. It's probably not politically correct to say this, but I also don't look like a stereotypical Jewish person, at least in the eyes of neo-Nazis.\nI also think my image played into it. They saw a crackhead from Skid Row who weighed 130 pounds and just didn't connect that with a Jewish guy. So I got away with it. They believed I was just a German-American. They had no suspicion whatsoever.\nFor about three or four weeks, I played along. But I soon realized there was no need to. I never heard anything really racist or antisemitic.\nThere was another man named Lou. He was probably 50 years old, and every day, he would get a different meal than everyone else—a special meal in a blue box—and people lined up to buy it.\nI was curious. I looked in the garbage and saw there was Hebrew lettering on this blue box so I knew Lou was probably Jewish. I asked Lou if he was, and he said yes, that's why he gets the kosher meal.\nI said: \"I'm Jewish too, actually.\" He didn't really care. I said I had told the shot caller—a kind of gang leader—and all the guys that I was German when I came in, and now I'm thinking about getting the kosher meal.\nI asked what he thought the consequences would be of revealing that I was Jewish. He said: \"Oh, well, they're not going to care that you're Jewish, but they are going to care that you lied. So, I would just go talk to the shot caller privately and work this out.\"\nI expected a very violent repercussion for lying. There are violent repercussions for everything, from not washing your hands after using the bathroom to getting caught sharing food with another race.\nI talked to the shot caller. He was pretty angry that I lied, but at the same time, he said: \"Listen, I'm half Armenian. I'm not even fully white. We don't really care. These are just the rules and we have to follow them.\n\"As the shot caller, if it gets out that I'm not enforcing these rules, I'll get stabbed on the yard.\n\"You lied. You got to come clean to all the boys, and it's not a big deal. Just when you get the kosher meal, make sure that white guys get preference over buying it. If no one white wants to buy the meal, then you can sell it to the other races.\"\nOnce it came out that I was Jewish, I experienced zero antisemitic hate. It was more of a fascination. A lot of these people had never met a Jewish person. They pictured Jewish people as owning banks and companies and potentially even the jail.\nSo when they saw this Skid Row homeless addict who was Jewish, a lot of light bulbs went off about their preconceived ideas. Immediately, they asked: \"What are you doing here? Can't you make a phone call? Don't you know a lawyer?\"\nI said: \"No, I'm Jewish. My dad was a heroin addict carpenter. Not all Jews are what you think they are.\"\nIt opened up a lot of playful conversations with these people. They were fascinated with the concept that Jews were lawyers, so I started getting a lot of requests to consult people on their cases.\nI had to tell them: \"Listen, I'm a carpenter crackhead homeless guy. I'm not a lawyer.\"\nThey didn't care; they wanted to go over their cases with me. There was almost some soft antisemitism, but it mostly was playful and fanciful obsession and inquiry. They thought I had mystical powers.\nAfter a while, they realized I was just a normal guy like them.\nI suppose it's a similar situation to an investment banker ending up in a jail pod with a bunch of gangbangers. You'd think that would be a hindrance, but at the same time, it's such a unique experience.\nIt's like Sam Bankman-Fried right now in prison. You see these pictures of him with the other inmates, and it's like guys are obsessed with him because it's so uncanny that this famous former multibillionaire is in jail with them.\nThese people I was with had never really interacted with Jews. At least, never a Jew who was on their level. But they could see: I'm in here with you. I did some crazy crime just like you. I smoke meth just like you. I come from a broken home just like you.\nThey were fascinated with that. I talked to Lou about it, and he said that there used to be some problems for Jews, but in the end, the white gangs have such low numbers that they don't really care. They needed people.\nViolence is highly organized in the California prison system. I was in county jail, but it's just as bad as prison, if not worse.\nIf you get into an altercation with someone, you're not allowed to fight them. You have to go to your shot caller, and he has to go to his shot caller, and the shot callers must decide whether you're allowed to fight in a very controlled environment.\nI saw little violence between races. If someone from one race attacks a person from another race, it is a requirement that everyone joins in on that fight, and it turns into a race riot.\nNo one wanted a race riot because they result in the loss of privileges such as television or going to the yard. All these rules are set up to prevent a race riot.\nBut it did happen while I was in there.\nA Mexican gentleman was giving a face tattoo to a white guy, who made a comment saying he didn't think it was a very good job, and they got into a fight.\nIf a Mexican guy was in a fight with a white guy, it was a requirement that every white person and every Mexican joins that fight.\nI was hanging out with my Mexican friends at the time. We were making food, and the race riot kicked off. We all just kind of looked at each other, and one of them gave me a nod and hit me a few times lightly.\nIt turned into a big rumble, but you don't get that hurt because it's chaos in a small area. The guards came in, and it ended, and everything just went back to normal.\nThere were other occurrences of violence. When they punished someone for breaking a rule, my shot caller would get three guys to beat up the rule-breaker.\nBecause of my small stature, they would use me as an abatement—two big guys and one sort of smallish-medium guy. I was used a lot for that, and I didn't enjoy it.\nI had to fight people for breaking very stupid rules, such as sharing food with a Black person—a rule that I think is ridiculous. To be honest, my shot caller thought it was ridiculous too.\nHe told me personally that he shared food with Black people all the time; he just had to keep it secret.\nIt's Kafkaesque; there's some kind of bureaucratic overwatch going on and you don't even know if it exists or not, but you just have to follow these dumb rules.\nA shot caller is your gang leader in jail. This is not the leader of the entire gang but the leader in your pod, meaning your dorm.\nEvery gang has a shot caller, and then that jail has a head shot caller, and then the whole prison system has a single shot caller somewhere at the top that is this Wizard of Oz-type overlord who no one ever really sees but somehow enforces the rules.\nI had a pretty good relationship with the Mexican shot caller who had become very intrigued by an aspect of my Jewish experience in jail.\nI'm not a practicing Jew; I never was, and no one in my family really is. But when you get the kosher meal, they also give you a yarmulke for some reason.\nWhen the other inmates saw the yarmulke, they were mesmerized by this magical Jewish hat. The people who ran the world wore these hats, they thought, and now they were around one in a jail cell.\nThe Mexican shot caller would request to wear it when he gambled to bring him financial luck. This started sort of a buzz in the jail, and eventually, lots of people were requesting to wear it. Even neo-Nazis requested to wear it when they were gambling.\nI asked them to treat it with respect, not because I am religious, but I thought: \"My ancestors were religious. Don't be disrespectful.\"\nThe amount of respect they had for this yarmulke was actually disturbing; the fact that a Nazi with swastika tattoos would be so polite about a Jewish yarmulke.\nI have stayed in touch with some of the people in jail. Not all white people were Nazis. In fact, a small minority identified as neo-Nazis; most just identified as Peckerwoods. I've kept in touch with both.\nOne of the neo-Nazis has covered his swastika tattoo since getting out and turned his life around. I'm not saying I'm responsible for that, but I might have planted a seed or played a role in his thought process.\nI really enjoyed my time in jail and it was incredibly valuable for me, but it did not cure the mental obsession of addiction. It was not therapeutic in any way.\nI did kick heroin in jail for the last time. It was the worst withdrawal I've ever experienced, and I never wanted to do that again, but I did keep relapsing for very short bursts of time.\nFortunately, after some months outside, I wound up in a nonprofit long-term treatment center filled with a bunch of people that had been in and out of prison and jail. But this was a therapeutic community that was long-term.\nI was introduced to a community of recovery. I experienced some terrible health consequences in my period between getting out of jail and getting into this treatment center.\nBut in this long-term treatment center, I got to live for free for many months. Eventually, they helped me to get a job. They helped me to get tools and work clothes, and I got to enter a community of over 100 people who held me accountable.\nThat was the magic. That's what worked.\nI know a lot of people I was in rehab with just didn't have that. They felt hopeless; they were in their 30s or 40s and couldn't get a job other than in fast food. They just felt like they could never get ahead, and a lot of those people ended up relapsing.\nI did carpentry for a few years after I got sober, and then I eventually moved into other careers. I did visual effects for a few years, and then after the strike, I now work in property management.\nI credit labor and carpentry as a key factor in why I was able to get sober because it gave me hope. I immediately got a job that was decent paying, and I was doing something creative and constructive. It gave me a sense of purpose.\nI've written about all my experiences in my memoir, Crooked Smile. And the biggest life lesson I've learned from them is: The world doesn't owe me anything.\nI went through 29 years of life thinking that the world owed me something because my parents were heroin addicts, and I grew up in a very dysfunctional crack house with a lot of trauma.\nI thought because of that, I could have my cake and eat it too. I was allowed to get high unlike other people, and I deserved to commit crimes and be a menace to society because of the things I went through as a child.\nBut I realized all that gets you is sleeping on the cement or in a jail cell—if you're lucky. If you're not lucky, you end up dead.\nWhen that clicked, I saw that I've had a pretty amazing life, and the fact that I even come from a two-parent home is unbelievable. The fact that I grew up in America is unbelievable.\nI changed my thought process and realized: All my deficits are actually assets.\nThe fact that I went through all these horrible things and was homeless and on drugs could be turned into an asset when applying for a job or being a stand-up citizen.\nAll these experiences make me appreciate the smallest things in life. I'll never be unappreciative of having a pillow ever again. I went years without a pillow, and now when I have a bad day, I just think about my pillow.\nIt's that simple.\nJared Klickstein is the author of Crooked Smile: What It Took to Escape a Decade of Homelessness, Addiction, & Crime, which publishes on June 25, 2024.\nAll views expressed are the author's own.\nAs told to Shane Croucher.\nDo you have a unique experience or personal story to share?

    "content": "Recent statistics pointing to employee training fatigue, particularly in the context of IT and security training, highlight a growing concern about the effectiveness of training programs and their ability to adequately engage employees. This is not only true among the general population of employees, but also among IT staff members. One study found that 25% of IT security professionals are seriously considering leaving their jobs — 24% are considering leaving the profession entirely.\nA related concern — especially as many organizations have transferred much of their learning and development (L&D) activities into the digital realm, is growing fatigue related to digital overload. This overload, along with a proliferation of communication channels, is leading to a drop in engagement with cybersecurity training — 45% say that this overload is reducing their ability to effectively identify and respond to cybersecurity threats.\nThat's a situation that organizations and their HR and L&D staff need to be aware of and take steps to address. Here are some ways you can improve your cybersecurity awareness training efforts to achieve better results.\nMost cybersecurity training — in fact, most corporate training, in general — tends to be all too painfully similar. The pandemic drove many training efforts online and there many stayed. There's a benefit in being able to access training on-demand, but there can be tedium too. While this mainstay format may be part of your training efforts, consider ways you might dare to be different when providing cybersecurity training.\nSuggestions:\n• Random, interactive polls in a competitive format with \"winners\" applauded and \"losers\" privately provided with personalized coaching.\n• Pop-up news notifications challenges. When a breach occurs at an organization like yours, push the news out to staff along with a challenge question. For instance: \"What steps could you personally take to help prevent something like this from happening at our office?\" Share the best responses at an all-hands meeting or in the company newsletter.\n• Provide training in tidbits. Arm managers and supervisors with brief key points or messages that can be shared in bite-sized pieces, quickly, during staff meetings.\n• User-generated content. Get employees involved by challenging them to create brief TikTok-like videos highlighting important cybersecurity points in a fun and entertaining way. Offer prizes for the best/most liked content.\nThere are a variety of ways that you can think creatively about how to deliver security awareness training. While traditional training may still be your mainstay, think of ways you could enliven it by adding some additional, innovative, and interactive training options.\nConsider how you might incorporate best practices into all your security awareness training efforts.\nRudimentary forms of training can be traced back to prehistoric times. Corporate training also has a long history. R. Hoe and Company is credited with offering the first form of workplace training back in 1872. You'd think we would have picked up some good best practices over the past 150 years. And we have.\n• Provide variety. Mix up your content delivery by incorporating a balance of lectures with interactive elements like quizzes, polls, group discussions, and simulations.\n• Incorporate gamification. People like competition. Augment training with competitions, leaderboards, rewards, and prizes.\n• Offer flexibility and variation. Employee learning preferences are varied; training offers should be, too.\n• Make it visually appealing — and modern. Today's employees are used to consuming information in highly visual, often entertaining formats — think YouTube and Instagram.\n• Make it relevant. Make sure it's clear to your employee learners why this information is important, and relevant, to them. Yes, it will benefit the organization. But what will they, personally, get out of it? Hint: employees have security-related concerns just like your organization does. How can this information help them protect their family data and devices?\n• Make it personalized. Don't create a one-size-fits-all training course because one size doesn't fit all. For instance, the information required by the IT staff will differ from that needed by employees in the marketing department. Don't force them to consume the same information.\n• Seek ongoing feedback from employees and managers to learn how training can be made more engaging and impactful. Do employees feel the training was relevant and enjoyable? Did they learn something? Are managers and supervisors seeing the information impacting behaviors?\n• Track progress continually — not just learner sentiment about the training but actual organizational impact. Has security awareness improved? Have incidents lessened or have reports increased? Have specific goals related to your cybersecurity awareness training and measure against those goals. Share results with employees, and thank them for their efforts in helping to achieve goals. Enlist their support to close identified gaps.\n• Commit to continuous improvement. Security awareness is a journey, not a destination. You will never achieve 100% success, but you can achieve incremental improvement over time.\nEmployee training fatigue is real. But it doesn't have to be a constraint on your training efforts. Think of ways you can approach training differently to better engage employees. What new methods and techniques will you implement to combat training fatigue?\n",

    "content": "Margie and Bud first met in the summer of 1953. She was 17, and dancing for Avery Production Company at Midwest summer county fairs. Bud was 21 and worked the night shift at the paper mill in Portage, Michigan, and attending college.\nWhile at the fair in Kalamazoo, Michigan, Margie and two other dancers befriended a boy who drove them in his yellow convertible to his friend Bud's house. The five of them talked, drank milk with ice cubes, and listened to Stan Keton's \"23 Degrees North and 83 Degrees West.\" Margie and Bud were smitten with each other.\nAt the end of the summer tour, Margie returned to Illinois to start her senior year in high school, and Bud continued to work and go to college.\nThey talked on the phone, wrote letters, and Bud drove 160 miles each way to visit Margie on the weekends. In 1954, at age 18, my mom celebrated her high school graduation and her engagement to Bud at the same party.\nBut marriage was not meant to be for the two young lovebirds. My mom said she was immature and times were different back then. She wished she understood and could communicate her feelings better.\nHer parents and church had ingrained in her that a woman doesn't live with, or sleep with a man until they're married. And once you're married, a woman gives up her career ambitions and supports her husband, their children, and home.\nMy mom had just been offered a position managing a dance studio and her dream was to own it someday. She gave back the ring and broke Bud's heart.\nThey became strangers and moved on with their lives. He met another woman, and my mom married my biological father, who then died when I was three. Although he is listed as father on my birth certificate, I knew him only from pictures. I saw so little of him that when we moved in with my grandmother permanently, I was unaware that he passed away and I would never see him again.\nI didn't understand the hardships my mom went through during those years. My father had progressing kidney disease as a complication of juvenile diabetes, and she sheltered my siblings and I from all of it.\nWe often stayed with our grandmother while she sat at the hospital with him or tried to keep our home quiet and stress-free so he could rest. By then, she was running her dance studio out of the family room of her mother's house so she and my grandma could raise us and run a business.\nI loved playing in the dance studio—a big, empty room with mirrors lining the walls and a closet full of costumes. I vividly remember dressing up in oversized sequined leotards and skirts, trying on different costume hats, making faces in the mirrors, and twirling around. My cousins, siblings and I would roll out the long, black rubber mat and practice our headstands and somersaults. We'd put the mini tramp on the mat and run and jump for hours.\nOne day in first grade, my teacher instructed the class to address the letter we were working on to mom and dad, except me because I didn't have a dad. I could address mine to mom and grandma.\nFor the first time, I realized my family structure was different. I remember feeling special because of my unique situation but also that I was missing out because all the other kids had a dad.\nSo, when I was seven and my mom mentioned she was getting married, I was excited. I was going to have a real dad in my life this time. I was too young to notice they only had a three-month courtship or the arguments my mom and grandmother had about finances and trying to make ends meet.\nAll I knew was that I got to wear a pretty dress with a flower crown and my mom looked beautiful in her pink, dotted swiss dress and sausage curls around her face. And we were moving into a new house that my new dad built.\nUnfortunately, the thrill of having a new father was short-lived. Herb was good at getting up at the crack of dawn, putting roofs on houses, yelling in a loud, scary voice, and going to bed early.\nMy mom once again turned the family room into a dance studio to teach the neighborhood kids tap, jazz, ballet, and acrobatics, but now Herb would scold us for making too much noise, wasting our time playing, and not doing chores around the house.\nInstead of helping me develop my interests and personality, like the dad on Brady Bunch, Herb taught me to be quiet and disappear from a heated situation without anyone noticing.\nMy mom stayed married to Herb for 40 years until his verbal and emotional abuse dangerously affected her health. They had moved to a hobby farm in Wisconsin and Herb's physical and mental health were declining leaving her with all the farm work.\nThe doctors could not get her blood pressure under control and told her she had to make a drastic change or she was headed for a stroke and/or heart attack. She was 76 years old.\nThat same day, she told Herb she wanted a divorce. I was shocked at her uncharacteristic boldness. Although she complained about Herb over the years, she took great pride in her marital vows, and I never thought she'd leave him.\nShe asked me to set an appointment with a lawyer in her county to start the proceedings. After the meeting, she drove 300 miles south to my house. I knew she was frazzled by the whole situation when she arrived with her dog, Murray, in the passenger seat of her compact Ford pickup truck and the belongings she felt were important haphazardly thrown in the back cab. She began to cry when she realized she packed her purple boa and forgot her underwear and cash.\nWhile living at my house, I helped my mom set up a Facebook account and within weeks, fate stepped in, and Bud reentered our lives. It only took six months for Bud to propose to my mother a second time—with the same ring he picked out for her in 1954 on State Street in Chicago. He'd kept it all these years, amazingly.\nThis time, she said yes and meant it, and I saw a sparkle in her eye I'd never seen before.\nWhen my mother finally married the man I most consider my father I was a grown woman of 46, divorced and remarried with three kids of my own.\nMargie and Bud moved to Florida, bought a house, and had their wedding around the backyard pool. They were 77 and 81. During the ceremony, my mom danced a hula for Bud to The Hawaiian Wedding Song. Two of Bud's three adult children were in attendance, along with my sister and myself; the rest of their children were unable to attend.\nI was thankful I got to know Bud, my stepfather. He took a genuine interest in me and instantly welcomed me into his life and home. I think he automatically loved me because he loved my mom so deeply and that sincere emotion felt good—a comfort I had never felt from a platonic relationship before.\nOne day while I was visiting my mom and Bud, he randomly gave me a book, Many Lives, Many Masters by Brian Weiss, saying he thought I might like it.\n\"OK, thanks,\" I said. \"What do you like about this book?\"\n\"After reading it, I'm not afraid to die,\" he said. \"I just got a sense you'd like it.\"\nHe was right. The book about past lives and our purpose here on earth resonated with my beliefs. It felt nice to have an adult male figure take an interest and encourage something that was important to me, even as a grown woman.\nJust four years later, Bud died from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. My mom struggled with the nagging questions that tugged at her heart: What if?\nWhat if she didn't get cold feet back when she was 18 and give the ring back? What if she hadn't been intimidated by his worldly experiences of being in the army and working full-time? What if the culture was different and she could have had her dance studio and get married?\nWhat if he had been my father? I thought.\nI was in the house when he crossed over peacefully. I woke in the morning to find my mom sitting by the temporary hospital bed in the living room, holding his colorless hand. She said she just wanted to sit quietly with him one last time.\nThe little girl deep inside me had always ached for a father figure, and my mom had waited a lifetime for her soul mate. Even if we only had him for four short years, Bud had given us what we each needed, and for that I am forever grateful.\nThere's a saying that everything happens for a reason, but very often it's hard to understand the reasoning behind certain events.\nI'm the person I am today because of the decisions she made and those I made with the knowledge and experiences we had at the time. I've had a wonderful life but I'm still trying to heal the little girl who longed for a father to love her.\nMelania Murphy is a freelance writer specializing in a wide range of topics from parenting to gender equality to life after 50.

    "publishedAt": "9:52 AM EDT, Thu May 9, 2024",
    "content": "One man’s loss is another man’s gain, goes the saying – and as Boeing seems caught in a spiral of bad news, one aircraft manufacturer is quietly powering ahead.\nBrazilian manufacturer Embraer, which specializes in smaller narrow-body passenger jets, has been clocking up major announcements, and will soon comprise the entire regional fleet of American Airlines.\nAnd now, rumor has it that the company might be setting its sights even higher. A Wall Street Journal report last week suggested that Embraer – currently the world’s third largest aircraft manufacturer – was planning a new narrow-body jet that could “compete head-on” with the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 Max, which have cornered the global market.\nEmbraer has denied the reports. Yet the company’s star is certainly on the rise.\nOn May 2, Embraer delivered its 1,800th E-Jet aircraft: an E190-E2, to Royal Jordanian Airlines. Five days later, Singapore-based Scoot Airlines took delivery of its first Embraer: another E190-E2, the quietest and most fuel-efficient single-aisle jet on the market.\nEven in the US, where Boeing has traditionally ruled the roost, Embraer has been making waves.\nOn March 26, United announced a refurb of its Embraer E175 fleet to add larger overhead bins on its Skywest-operated planes. The move will increase storage space by 80%. Skywest is the world’s largest operator of Embraer’s E175 aircraft.\nThen there’s American Airlines, which announced the purchase of 90 E175 aircraft in March, making AA’s entire regional fleet Embraer by the end of the decade.\nThe love-in continued in April, when CEO Robert Isom praised the Brazilian company during a quarterly call. “The rest of the industry… can learn a lot from them,” he said, while also delivering a public rebuke to Boeing to, “Get your act together.”\nIt’s almost as if as Boeing’s star continues to fall, Embraer’s continues to rise. But can it go even bigger – and turn the “Big Two” of the skies into a “Big Three?”\nTo do so would require coming up with a new, larger aircraft to rival the 737MAX and the A320. At the moment, Embraer aircraft carry a maximum of 146 passengers, compared to the MAX’s minimum 172. It’d also mean scaling up – Embraer delivered 181 jets in 2023, of which 64 were commercial aircraft. Before the pandemic, it was delivering around 90 commercial aircraft per year.\nYet as Boeing struggles to regain public trust, experts say there’s room for someone else to grab a place in the market.\n“The door is open a little for a [Boeing] 737 replacement,” says Robert van der Linden, curator of air transportation at the National Air and Space Museum. Although he notes that it could close again “quickly,” and that debuting a new aircraft is a colossal task for manufacturers, he believes that Embraer might uniquely be capable of making headway in the aviation market – it already has the contacts and reputation.\nRodrigo Silva e Souza, Embraer’s VP of marketing who’s responsible for strategic planning, doesn’t deny that he’s looking at potential options, but says, “That’s my job.”\n“Designing, producing and delivering high-quality, highly reliable products is in our DNA, and I think that’s bringing some contrasts with what we’re seeing with other players,” he says, carefully.\nBut he tells CNN that aircraft take at least a decade to design and build, so while the current gap looks promising, they won’t be jumping in feet-first.\n“Designing an aircraft takes 10 years, and in 10 years from now the situation is completely different.\n“If someone had designed this before, they could be jumping in now, but you don’t decide to make a new aircraft and have it ready next year,” he says.\nSo could Embraer muscle its way to the top? It’s made it against the odds so far.\nFor an aircraft manufacturer with such a toehold in the US market, Embraer’s origins might come as a surprise.\nBased in São José dos Campos, in the state of São Paulo, the company was founded in 1969 by the Brazilian government – its name is a portmanteau of Empresa Brasileira de Aeronáutica (Aeronautics Corporation of Brazil) – on the back of the development of the Bandeirante, a twin-turboprop aircraft.\nInitially used for the Brazilian military, the Bandeirante entered commercial service in 1972. With 15-21 seats, it was aimed at “commuter companies,” says Alvaro Romero, a Chilean aviation historian.\nRelated article\nChina’s C919 passenger jet to make first commercial flight\nThe company was privatized in 1994, and went public on the stock market in 2000. By that time, says van der Linden, it had already cracked the US.\n“They found a very comfortable niche market for regional jets,” he says.\n“It was very wise not to compete directly with Boeing and Airbus. Try and break into an oligopoly and chances are you’re going to get squashed.\n“Regional jets carry anything from 35 to almost 150 passengers and Embraer grabbed hold of that market.”\nIn the regional market, Embraer’s primary competitor was Canada’s Bombardier, which sold its commercial manufacturing arm to Airbus in 2020.\nIn fact, Embraer nearly made a similar deal with Boeing in 2019, when the US giant signed up to take an 80% stake in the Brazilian company’s commercial division – before reneging on the deal in 2020. You could call it Embraer’s lucky escape.\nNow, says Silva e Souza, Embraer’s main rival is Airbus itself.\nSo how has Embraer succeeded where others have failed? For van der Linden, Brazil was far-sighted. “As early as the 1940s, the Brazilian government was interested in establishing aviation and aerospace manufacturing,” he says. Government backing meant that Embraer had money to produce quality planes from the outset. “It developed a very well-deserved reputation,” he says.\nFor aero historian Mario Overall, a member of the Latin American Aviation Historical Society, Embraer is an “exceptional” company. He puts that global success down to several factors, from its diverse portfolio (Embraer still makes military airplanes and private jets) to its designs, export strategy and outsourcing supply, keeping costs down. “Its versatility has enabled Embraer to cater to a wide range of customers,” he says. Yet he calls taking on Boeing a “daunting” process and doesn’t believe it’ll develop a larger narrowbody.\nWith major US carriers operating small planes on regional routes, Embraer’s focus on sub-200 passenger planes – its largest, the E195, has a maximum capacity of 146 seats – is a perfect fit for the US market. They’re also used on less-trafficked routes in Latin America and Europe, as well as at difficult airports. At London City, which requires a steep 5.5 degree approach for the short runway, 85% of the aircraft are Embraers.\nAnd while, by the numbers, AA and United are its top clients, Embraer’s biggest airline fan is perhaps LOT Polish Airlines, where 43 of its 75-strong fleet are Embraers (this week, it announced another three).\n“These aircraft have been instrumental in our strategy to expand our network, allowing us to confidently launch new routes, even to destinations with initially lower demand. The Embraer fleet’s reliability, efficiency, and passenger appeal make them indispensable,” says LOT spokesperson Krzysztof Moczulski.\nIt’s not just airlines; plenty of frequent flyers have a crush, too.\n“In Europe, it’s the best way to fly economy,” says Koen Berghuis of the 82-seater ERJ-175, which he flies on regularly with LOT.\n“You have so much legroom, shoulder room, and some airlines have really comfortable seating. You don’t feel like you’re in a sardine can, which I feel on the Boeing 737 MAX. But the 2-2 configuration is the main benefit,” says Berghuis, editor-in-chief of travel blog Paliparan.\nThat’s right – the dreaded middle seat simply doesn’t exist. In first class on American and United, Embraer goes one better – it’s a 1-2 configuration. The smaller jets even have 1-2 in economy, too.\nRelated article\nWhen is a car faster than a plane? When it’s electric\nTravel vlogger Paul Lucas actively seeks to fly Embraer.\n“It’s really pleasant to fly on – it has really big windows that mean loads of cabin light,” he says (van der Linden compares the windows of a bijou Embraer to those on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner).\n“They feel like mainline jets inside, but have the operational benefits of a regional jet,” Lucas says of Embraer’s E-jet range. “They probably should get more of a profile.”\nFor him, a key reason why Embraer doesn’t get the same hype as the Big Two is that it’s Brazilian.\n“In the US, Boeing is a flagship company – Americans were proud of it until recently. And Airbus is pan-European,” he says.\n“Then there’s Embraer.”\nAs Boeing spirals, is there a chance for Embraer to break through?\nSilva e Souza says that the company’s current focus is the Energia project, which aims to develop 30-seater hybrid-electric aircraft by 2030, slashing the aircraft carbon emissions by 30% (90% if using SAF). A hydrogen-fuel-cell version is planned for 2035, with a 50-seater scheduled for 2040.\nHe also predicts an untapped market for small, sustainable planes to replace long drives.\nAnd while he insists that the company is concentrating on “harvesting” following “10-15 years of very strong development” – he’s not denying that they’re eyeing all options.\nAt the Dubai Airshow in November, he hinted that the company was scanning markets such as the Middle East, where it says that only 16% of flights are full – meaning smaller aircraft could make certain routes more profitable. Meanwhile the company’s 2023 Market Outlook report suggests that “the future lies in the middle” – which Silva e Souza defines as 100-150 seats.\nCould that “middle” get a little bigger, though? The troubled Boeing MAX starts at 172 seats – not far off Embraer’s E2-195, which seats 146.\nThe only other potential competitor is Comac’s C919, currently only certified to operate in China. Silva e Souza believes that Chinese-made aircraft will make it into the global market, but “it’ll take a long time.”\nHe doesn’t deny that Embraer is monitoring the market, however. “We speak to investors. We keep looking: smaller, bigger, commercial, defense – for each we talk to partners who will help build the business case. But we’ve done nothing specifically on the [MAX rival].\n“We’re confident in our capabilities. But it’s very different taking decisions on the current situation for a product that will come 10 years from now.”\nIf they did take the plunge, they have an army of fans waiting to take flight.\n",

    "content": "\"You have brains and your brother has personality,\" Mom often said. Today's parenting experts wouldn't approve of her childrearing techniques, but her opinion wasn't far from the truth. Although my brother was intelligent, he didn't excel in school, whereas I was a straight-A Goody Two Shoes.\nOver the years, we grew apart as he moved from New York to Miami, and I started a new life in Toronto. We'd exchange the occasional phone call and we saw each other at weddings and family reunions.\nFour phone calls shattered this arrangement. The first: \"Your brother has had a seizure.\" He collapsed when the busy restaurant he managed was shuttered for renovations and they dismantled the bar. Apparently, alcohol withdrawal is dangerous. He went into a 28-day rehab and decided to leave the hospitality world's temptations. It turns out that his warm personality and quick wit were ideal for selling cars, which he excelled at, except when he went on a bender and didn't show up for work.\nThe second call: \"Sis, can you bail me out?\" He was in jail because he'd been found sleeping in his car with an open container of alcohol. After many phone calls and a bank transfer, he was released from the clink.\nThe third call: \"Your brother robbed a bank.\" It seems that a month earlier, he had successfully robbed a bank. Because it was so easy, he returned for a second go-round. The teller spotted him waiting in line wearing the same sunglasses and blazer from the previous crime. \"I only had one bank-robbing outfit,\" he quipped years later.\nClassified as a violent offender because of the 99-cent plastic pistol that never left his pocket, John was sentenced to 41 months in prison.\nWe called my brother Pepo after the neighborhood boys nicknamed him when he was 10. Now Pepo was languishing in a cell, surrounded, as he said, by \"assorted scumbags, murderers, rapists, bankers, lawyers and stockbrokers.\"\nWhat does a sibling do in this situation? If you're me, you write a letter. I was relieved to see a return envelope from him appear soon after. To keep his mind occupied, Pepo began penning stories of growing up in Astoria, Queens.\nHe described getting a job in a barber shop as a shoeshine boy at age 12 after our father abandoned the family and Mom sometimes didn't have grocery money. He wrote about the neighborhood kids and their shenanigans, playing stickball, and getting cuffed by the nuns at school.\nDelighted by his stories and his writing voice, I told him he possessed genuine creative talent. He didn't believe me: \"Oh, you're just being nice so the guards don't find me hanging off the bunk with the band from my boxers around my neck.\"\nSlowly, over five years in prison and halfway houses, my brother began to think of himself as a writer. He fantasized about getting his stories published. I encouraged this thinking because I thought his writing was solid, he had a funny and perceptive point of view, and because I didn't want him hanging off that top bunk.\nIntertwined with his growing-up reminiscences were his prison tales. At first, he didn't want to scare me by sharing stories about his cellmates, like Topo, who committed his first murder at age nine.\nMore than once, he told me he felt closer to me because of our flow of communication. In addition to the letters back and forth, there were phone calls, albeit one-way because one cannot call into a prison. We developed a more intimate relationship, sharing thoughts and feelings that would never have been revealed if he'd been living in the busy outside world.\nThe day he walked out of prison, he was sent to a halfway house and was fortunate to find a job in a warehouse with a boss who understood the conditions of ex-cons who had to check in with authorities, submit to frequent drug tests, and so on. Still, he was paid the lowest legal wage.\nI visited him twice in 2009 when he was back home in Miami. On that second visit, he was shaky. We held hands across a steakhouse table and wept. He feared violating his conditions by drinking. He couldn't bear being sent back to prison, a genuine possibility. He longed for the day when he would be truly free and could earn good money to support his family. But this was not to be.\nHere comes phone call number four: \"Pepo has passed away.\" In May 2010, he fell in his home and hit his head. We were devastated to lose him. All that potential, gone. He was only 52.\nI vowed to transcribe and edit his letters. Some were 16 pages, handwritten, on yellow legal paper in my brother's almost-illegible scrawl. Today, his stories have come to life in a book. By reading it, I hope his children and grandchildren will somehow feel closer to this beautiful, funny, broken man.\nDonna Papacosta is a mostly retired communications consultant and university instructor in Toronto, Canada.

    "content": "Editor’s Note: Noah Berlatsky (@nberlat) is a freelance writer in Chicago. The views expressed here are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\nWar films often try to overwhelm you with authenticity. Movies like “Saving Private Ryan,” (1998), “Dunkirk,” (2017) or this year’s “Civil War” saturate viewers with the realism of their combat sequences and the gritty power of simulated trauma. That’s why war movies are often treated as serious and important: They offer what seems to be unique, powerful access to a rare but important experience. Watch “Apocalypse Now” (1979), “Full Metal Jacket” (1987) or “Platoon” (1986) and you should know what war really means.\nGuy Ritchie’s “The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare” claims to be based on true events; it’s modeled on the 1942 World War II Operation Postmaster, in which a British team seized enemy ships in the Spanish harbor of Fernando Po. But even 10 minutes in, the connection to the real experience of war is tenuous.\nThe film is a rip-roaring, goofy adventure yarn. And while I wouldn’t necessarily say that makes this a better movie than “Apocalypse Now,” there is something refreshing, even honest, about Ritchie’s willingness to toss pretension overboard, and let a fictional film own its fictional inauthenticity.\n“Ungentlemanly Warfare” features a disreputable band of riff raff brought together for a super-secret mission. That mission is to sink a key German vessel which resupplies German U-boats. The ship is in neutral waters off Fernando Po, and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill (a frantically mugging Rory Kinnear) needs a team he can disavow. He turns to Gus March-Phillips (Henry Cavill in masses of insouciant facial hair) as a leader with subordinates including titanically cheerful Scandinavian murder machine Anders Lassen (Alan Ritchson) and the brave, elegantly sensuous, undercover operative Marjorie Stewart (Eiza González.)\nThe setting comes with ready-made villains in the Nazis and patriotic resonance, but the plot machinations barely matter; they’re merely an excuse to show our heroes making dry quips about cricket and their own indomitability as they shoot fascists in the head, carve out their hearts and set off extremely large explosions.\nThe protagonists are so dashing, hypercompetent and destined for victory that there isn’t even really any suspense. “The Guns of Navarone” (1961) — an obvious precursor — was at least willing to acknowledge that in war, sometimes good people die. Ritchie makes no such concessions to authenticity in “Ungentlemanly Warfare.”\nYou could argue that this kind of glib triumphalism ill prepares people for the realities of war, or for the reality of fascism. And, sure, you’d have a point. Our rag-tag band has no doubts as they swagger to victory; they literally giggle when Nazis threaten them and chat nonchalantly while being tortured by electroshock.\nDecency comes as easily as courage: Only the Nazis are prejudiced, while the good guys are untouched by the racism and sexism endemic in their era (as, for that matter, in ours). Churchill’s history of colonial atrocities is of course never mentioned. Fighting fascism in others, and fascist sympathies on one’s own side, looks easy. Which, as we know from our current threats to democracy, is not the case.\nYet the movie is so unremittingly silly that it’s hard to imagine anyone taking it seriously as a blueprint for anything, let alone fascist-fighting. This deliberate unreality seems inspired by Quentin Tarantino’s 2009 “Inglourious Basterds,” a film in which Hitler is killed in 1944, a year before the war actually ended, saving immeasurable suffering and misery. He’s assassinated by a group of awesome Jewish fighters and plotters, providing a satisfying revenge arc and a violent orgy of poetic justice.\n“Inglourious Basterds” is a tour de force of wish fulfillment; it’s not just satisfying, but painfully poignant, because you know, and you know Tarantino knows, that the war did not happen like that. The (relatively) easy victory underlines the truth that the cost of fighting fascism is higher than can possibly be conveyed in a revenge fantasy or movie.\n“Ungentlemanly Warfare” is by no means that smart or that powerful. But its cheerful pulp genre dreamworld in which the right guys win still has a knowing, innocent charm. At least its tongue-in-cheek approach means that no one is likely to come away from it thinking that a muscley invulnerable Danish dude really won World War II single-handed with a bow and arrow.\nWhen talented directors, actors, special effects crews and camera teams put all of their resources into convincing audiences that what they’re seeing on screen is What War Is Really Like, they can make even sophisticated viewers feel like they have been given a glimpse of something authentic, even when they’ve been fed a myth or an outright lie.\nHow many people who watched “Apocalypse Now” think that Vietnam during the war was a barely developed jungle, rather than a crowded and urbanized society? How many people who watched “Full Metal Jacket” took the hyper sexualization of Asian women as gospel?\nEven when a war movie doesn’t actively mislead you, the promise of being privy to an unvarnished, authentic and extreme experience can be seductive. Violent imagery of war doesn’t necessarily lead people to fear war; sometimes it fascinates, or makes them breathe “hard core,” as one character famously does in the climactic moments of “Full Metal Jacket.”\n\nIf you set war up as the realest thing, many people (and especially many young men) will want to go to war so they can say that they experienced the most real thing. That was one of the ways Hitler sought to justify his endless militarism to the Germans. Mankind has grown great in eternal war,” he wrote. “It would decay in eternal peace.”\nCompared to that kind of cult of authentic war, “Ungentlemanly Warfare” feels fairly harmless, and not in a bad way. The combat sequences are efficient and anodyne; they make no effort to overpower you.\nIt’s a fun bauble to watch, not an important window into a vital experience that you should, or need to, live out yourself. I wouldn’t want all movies to be this unambitious, but there is something to be said for a movie that knows it’s a movie, not an authentic experience of war.\n",

    "content": "Acclaimed Iranian filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof says he has fled his home country to an undisclosed location in Europe after a court in Iran sentenced him to prison on national security charges.\nRasoulof condemned the Iranian government in an Instagram post on Monday, calling it a tyrannical and oppressive regime, and posting a video that showed him crossing the country’s mountainous border.\n“If geographical Iran suffers beneath the boots of your religious tyranny, cultural Iran is alive in the common minds of millions of Iranians who were forced to leave Iran due to your brutality and no power can impose its will on it. From today, I am a resident of cultural Iran,” he said.\nIn a separate statement dated May 12, Rasoulof said he had decided to escape Iran after his lawyers told him his prison sentence would be implemented on short notice.\n“I had to choose between prison and leaving Iran. With a heavy heart, I chose exile,” he said in that statement, which was provided by a spokesperson.\nCNN has reached out to Iranian authorities for comment. His lawyer Babak Paknia said last week that an Iranian court had sentenced Rasoulof to eight years in prison and flogging after it found his films and documentaries to be “examples of collusion with the intention of committing a crime against the security of the country.”\nRasoulof is among several high-profile artists to have been caught up in a widening crackdown on dissent by Iranian authorities since nationwide protests broke out over the 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini, who was arrested for allegedly not wearing her headscarf properly.\nRasoulof, whose recent films have been critical of the Iranian government, was among a group of artists and filmmakers who signed a letter criticizing the violent response of security forces to quell a 2022 protest over a building collapse in the southwestern city of Abadan that killed more than 40 people.\nRasoulof won a Golden Bear for best film at the Berlinale festival in 2020 for “There Is No Evil” and his film “A Man of Integrity” was recognized for a “Certain Regard” honor at the Cannes Film Festival in France in 2017.\nRelated article\nIran sentences renowned director to 8 years in prison and flogging, lawyer says\nThe filmmaker’s latest work, “The Seed of the Sacred Fig,” is set to premiere at Cannes next week, but it’s unclear if he will be able to attend.\n“We are very happy and much relieved that Mohammad has safely arrived in Europe after a dangerous journey,” said Jean-Christophe Simon, the distributor for Rasoulof’s latest film.\nThe Films Boutique and Parallel45 executive added that he hopes that Rasoulof will be able to attend the Cannes premiere for his film “in spite of all attempts to prevent him from being there in person.”\nRasoulof said on Instagram that he will now work to quickly finish the last technical steps of his film’s post-production.\n“Many people helped to make this film. My thoughts are with all of them, and I fear for their safety and well-being,” he said, accusing the Iranian government of pressuring members of his production team with interrogations, court filings and travel restrictions.\nRasoulof didn’t specify how he escaped Iran, saying only that he did it secretly with the help of friends and acquaintances.\nIn 2022, an Iranian court sentenced Rasoulof to one year in prison and banned him from making films for two years on the charge of “propaganda against the system,” according to Human Rights Watch. Iranian authorities have previously arrested him multiple times and confiscated his passport because of his work, HRW said.\nAdditional reporting by Michael Rios\n",

    "content": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.\nA Chinese tech executive has ignited outrage in China with her fiery endorsement of toxic workplace culture, which eventually caused her to lose her own job.\nQu Jing, the former vice president and head of communications at Baidu, often dubbed China’s equivalent to Google, sparked a public relations crisis for the Chinese search engine after her controversial comments hit a raw nerve with young workers fed up with grueling hours and relentless pressure.\nIn a series of short videos posted last week on Douyin, China’s version of TikTok, Qu spoke about her devotion to her career, strict management style and unflagging demands on her direct reports.\nIn one video, she lashed out at an employee who refused to go on a 50-day business trip during the Covid-19 pandemic, when China imposed stringent travel restrictions and quarantines.\n“Why should I take my employee’s family into consideration? I’m not her mother-in-law,” Qu said. “I’m 10 years, 20 years older than you. I didn’t feel bitter about it or tired, even though I have two children. Who are you to tell me that your husband can’t stand it?”\nIn another clip, Qu shared her personal sacrifices as a working mother. She was working so hard that she forgot her elder son’s birthday and what grade her younger son was in at school. She said she didn’t regret it because she “chose to become a career woman.”\n“If you work in public relations, don’t expect weekends off,” she said in a third video. “Keep your phone on 24 hours a day, always ready to respond.”\nIn another video, she also threatened to retaliate against employees who complain about her, saying they wouldn’t get another job in the industry.\nThe American Psychological Association describes “toxic workplace” as an environment filled with infighting, intimidation and other affronts that harm productivity.\nFollowing the public outcry, Qu has lost her own job at Baidu (BIDU), a person familiar with the matter told CNN on condition of anonymity. CNN has also seen a screenshot of an internal personnel system that appears to confirm she no longer works at the company.\nBaidu did not immediately respond to a request for comment. By Thursday night, Qu had removed the title of “Baidu’s vice president” from her account on Douyin.\nQu had apologized earlier in the day and said her posts did not speak for Baidu.\nThe controversy soon became a trending topic on Douyin and Weibo, China’s X-like platform, dominating online discussions. Users criticized Qu for her aggressive and insensitive approach and accused her, and Baidu, of promoting a toxic workplace.\n“In her voice and in her tone, there’s deep indifference to and lack of empathy for the common plight of her colleagues,” said Ivy Yang, a China tech analyst and founder of consulting firm Wavelet Strategy.\n“A lot of what she said really struck a nerve, because people feel that in their own workplaces very often. The fact that she said it in a way that’s so direct and in your face, it just generated this kind of emotional response,” she said.\n“This is what the bosses are thinking, and she was merely saying it out aloud,” Yang added.\nChina’s young workers have increasingly spoken out against the culture of excessive overwork and extreme competitiveness that has come to dominate many industries, especially the tech sector.\nIn 2019, Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma drew intense criticism after endorsing the “996” trend, meaning working from 9am to 9pm six days a week, and calling it a “huge blessing.”\nYang called the backlash against Ma a “watershed moment” that led people to rethink the relationship between the workplace and themselves — a trend that has only intensified as the Chinese economy slows.\nChina’s economy grew stronger than expected at the start of this year, but problems — including a property crisis, declining foreign investment and tepid consumption — are piling up.\n“When companies demand complete loyalty, time and energy from their employees, employees feel there’s no reciprocity or reward for their sacrifice or contribution, especially when things are slowing down. That becomes the central conflict, and this conflict is also at the heart of the Baidu saga,” Yang added.\nAs public anger mounted, the videos posted on Qu’s personal Douyin account were taken down.\nAfter days of silence, Qu apologized on Thursday for “causing such a big storm” in a post on her personal account on WeChat, China’s most popular social media app.\n“I have carefully read all the opinions and comments from various platforms, and many criticisms are very pertinent. I deeply reflect on and humbly accept them,” Qu wrote.\nShe also sought to put distance between her remarks and Baidu, saying she had not sought approval beforehand and that they did not represent the company’s stance.\n“There were many inappropriate and unsuitable points made in the videos, which led to misunderstandings about the company’s values and culture, causing serious harm,” Qu wrote.\nA person familiar with the matter said Qu’s clips were part of her push to amplify Baidu’s voice on short video platforms, which have become an increasingly important channel for information dissemination in China.\nRelated article\nLabor Day isn’t the holiday it once was for China’s workers\nQu had asked all members of the PR team to create their personal accounts, according to the person, who requested anonymity.\n“The main purpose is to improve everyone’s ability to make short videos. Everyone can have different options over the content, and Cristina chose to speak about her personal experience,” said the person, referring to Qu’s English name.\nQu worked as a reporter for China’s state news agency Xinhua before switching to the PR industry. She joined Baidu in 2021 from Huawei, a Chinese tech giant known for its hard-charging “wolf culture,” where employees are expected to emulate wolves’ bloodthirsty nature, fearlessness and resilience.\nRen Zhengfei, the founder of Huawei, has previously said in interviews that its corporate culture was misunderstood. “Wolf culture,” he has said, meant “sensitivity, team spirit and resilience” and that the company didn’t have a “996 culture.”\nA former Baidu employee said Qu brought Huawei’s “aggressive” corporate culture with her to Baidu.\n“(She triggered) a pretty big culture shock. About 60% of the team left within months of her arrival,” the former employee told CNN on the condition of anonymity.\nThe PR team is expected to always be available, keep their phones on, reply to messages immediately and attend meetings at midnight and on weekends with short notice, the former employee said.\nQu also adopted the military-style language used in corporate management at Huawei, requiring the team to be “disciplined” and “able to win battles,” the former employee said.\nCNN has reached out to Huawei for comment.\nThis article has been updated with additional information.\n",

    "content": "Jerry Seinfeld is facing backlash online after saying he missed the \"dominant masculinity\" of 1960s America.\nTuesday, the comedian appeared on the Honestly With Bari Weiss podcast to promote his latest film, Unfrosted. Set in 1960s Michigan, the movie is loosely based on the real-life dispute between Pop-Tarts and Kellogg's to create a new favorite breakfast food.\nWeiss felt Unfrosted represented a \"sense of one conversation, a common culture.\" Seinfeld—who directed and starred in the film—agreed.\n\"That's part of what makes that moment attractive looking back,\" the 70-year-old said. He added: \"I always wanted to be a real man. I never made it, [but] in that era, it was JFK. It was Muhammad Ali. It was Sean Connery, Howard Cosell. You can go all the way down there. That's a real man.\"\n\"I miss a dominant masculinity,\" Seinfeld added. \"Yeah, I get the toxic thing. But still, I like a real man.\"\nIn April, the sitcom star sparked a similar uproar online following an interview with The New Yorker, in which he criticized the \"extreme left\" for what he saw as excessive political correctness, dubbing it \"PC crap.\"\nSeinfeld's interview with Weiss has gone viral, causing outrage on social media. One user on X, formerly Twitter, wrote, \"It's time someone took the mic away from Jerry.\"\n\"What a weird guy to bring this up,\" another user added.\n\"He's really embodying the 'old man shakes fist at clouds' persona now,\" a commenter wrote.\n\"Real men don't feel the need to be dominant or say things like this,\" another commented. \"They are secure in their masculinity.\"\nOther users supported Seinfeld's remarks, with one writing, \"I stand with Jerry.\"\n\"Jerry is spot on,\" another said.\nSome commenters felt the comedian's remarks had been taken out of context.\nAuthor Art Tavana wrote: \"He was mostly unserious and nostalgia-baiting. I think people just want to hate Jerry right now, and his choice to go on a political podcast isn't helping, but there you go; a bad PR move for a comedian who was (for a long time) mostly apolitical.\"\nIn the New Yorker interview, Seinfeld said excessive political correctness had led to a decline in the quality and availability of comedic TV shows.\n\"When you write a script and it goes into four or five different hands, committees, groups—'Here's our thought about this joke.' Well, that's the end of your comedy,\" Seinfeld said.​\nWhile conservative pundits and media outlets praised the 1990s icon for addressing what they saw as a significant cultural issue, others criticized Seinfeld for being out of touch.\nMany critics felt his comments overlooked external factors affecting the entertainment industry—including the recent writers' strike and the rise in streaming—as well as issues such as systematic racism and misogyny that \"woke\" diversity and inclusion policies attempt to fight.\n",

    "content": "For many of us, an identity card is a little piece of plastic tucked away in a wallet that we rarely think much about.\nBut for Hong Kong transgender activist Henry Tse, his ID card was something that dominated his world for the past seven years, the center of a lengthy court battle and a fight for recognition that finally concluded this week.\nOn Monday, Tse finally picked up a new ID card that registered his gender as male at Hong Kong’s immigration office.\n“This card in my hand means a lot to me and others who can finally get their new IDs,” he told reporters and photographers gathered outside.\nClad in a pink-and-blue-striped shirt over a white t-shirt – the colors of the transgender flag – he declared: “Finally, here comes the genuine solution to all the embarrassment and daily problems caused by an incompatible identity card.”\nTse’s legal battle is symptomatic of a wider trend across many places in East Asia where LGBTQ activists are forced to seek change through the courts against often conservative governments, even as public polls show growing acceptance for greater equality, especially among younger generations.\nThe 33-year-old activist, who holds both British and Hong Kong passports, identifies as a man and has lived as a man for years. His British passport identifies him as male but Hong Kong authorities refused to make that change for the city’s identity card, which is compulsory for all residents.\nThe card is essential for everything from filing tax returns and opening a bank account, to booking a tennis court or a doctor’s appointment.\nRelated article\nHong Kong’s top court tells government to create ‘legal recognition’ for same-sex partnerships\nFor years, Hong Kong authorities insisted a gender change could not be registered unless the applicant had completed full gender confirmation surgery which, under the city’s rules, meant the removal or reconstruction of their genitalia.\nTransgender rights groups have long argued that surgery is an individual’s choice and only one part of a person’s transition. Not all transgender people choose to have surgery, can afford to or are healthy enough to undergo such procedures which, like any surgery, can carry risks.\nSo in 2017, Tse took legal action against the Hong Kong government, which fought the case all the way.\nHong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal eventually ruled in Tse’s favor in February last year. But it took authorities more than a year to amend their policy to comply with the ruling, hence the long wait before Tse could finally retrieve his new ID card.\n“When I took legal action, I didn’t expect the case to last for six years and another 14 months until I can get my identity card,” Tse told CNN.\nEven under the new legal framework unveiled by Hong Kong’s government, female-to-male transgender applicants are only required to undergo top surgery (the removal of breasts). However, male-to-female applicants still must have full gender confirmation surgery.\nHong Kong’s Immigration Department said it had to “consider and study carefully” the court ruling as the policy-making process, involving legal and medical opinion, is “complex.”\nSince the ruling, the department said it had received 108 applications requesting a change of gender status. About one third of them have been approved while the rest are being processed, it told CNN.\nTse said life remained challenging while he waited for the government to act on the court order.\nHe described almost missing a flight because airline staff took issue with his gender on his old identity document and said he was detained by Chinese immigration officers while crossing the border into the mainland.\n“I was still so anxious and felt being treated like a prisoner,” he said.\nIn late March, he filed another lawsuit accusing the government of “unreasonable delay.” Two weeks later, the government announced the new policy.\nRelated article\nJapan’s top court rules against bathroom restriction for transgender government employee\nLGBTQ activists in Hong Kong have long questioned why they must keep fighting through the courts to gain recognition and equality, but they have nonetheless seen repeated successes.\nThat contrasts heavily with LGBTQ rights in mainland China where the community has come under increased pressure and scrutiny during the leadership of Xi Jinping.\nIn September last year, Hong Kong’s top court handed down the most far-reaching ruling yet, ordering the government to set up a new framework to legally recognize the rights of same-sex couples, despite not vouching for full marriage.\nThe government has not yet announced a concrete plan to put in place the court’s ruling.\nTaiwan became the first place in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage in 2019, two years after its Constitutional Court ruled that restrictions were unconstitutional.\nLast year Japan’s top court ruled against the government’s requirement that transgender people must be sterilized before they changed their gender.\nMeanwhile, a high court in Japan found in March this year that the country’s ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional, according to Reuters, in a case set to continue in the courts.\nFor Tse, his battle for equality has at least concluded.\n“What is normal for any other men has finally become normal for me,” he said.\n",

    "content": "\"N***** is just a word.\"\nThose five words were my piercing introduction to being an African American female teacher and graduate student in the field of composition pedagogy. Even now, more than two decades later, those five words remain a dominant memory of my experience earning my graduate degree in English.\nIt was a composition pedagogy and curriculum course for first-­year graduate students, and I was a proud and excited member of the cohort. We had received teaching assistantships as part of our graduate school funding package, and we were being trained to teach college-­level writing. The class was being team-taught by two instructors, one constructed as White female and the other constructed as White male.\nAt the time, the terminal degree offered by the university was in rhetoric and professional communication (RPC), and the RPC faculty theoretically managed the composition program, including training the new graduate teaching instructors. The class was pedagogically structured around the theoretical belief that all writing is an argument and around Aristotle's methods of persuasion.\nReadings about the art of constructing arguments, studying famous persuasive arguments, and class discussions were the primary content of the course. Toward the end of the course, students were tasked with developing writing course syllabi, writing assignments, assessment tools, and a theoretical and methodological rational narrative as support for our pedagogical delivery of the freshman composition curriculum.\n\"What did you say?\" I responded back to the professor. I was sure that I had misheard her. I was never allowed to use that word. I didn't use that word, and I couldn't understand why she was using this word in our classroom. I tried to look into the faces of my fellow students and future professional colleagues for help and support while the professor looked at mine, but my fellow students\nlooked away.\nThe class was working in small groups, and the professor pivoted and turned in the middle of the room to ensure that she made eye contact with everyone. I looked at the members of my small group, which just happened to be all the constructed people of color and other marginalized folks in the room: two African Americans (including me), one Afro-­Latinx, one White LGBTQ+ female, and one Muslim student. The remaining and dominant number of students in the classroom were constructed as White American.\n\"N***** is just a word,\" the White female professor said for the second time. She was short, and I swore that she bounced slightly up on the balls of her feet in beat, two times, with the consonant sounds in the word, n**-***.\nWe had read many essays and books, including Pedagogy of the Oppressed by Paulo Freire and the classic \"Just Walk On By: Black Men in Public Space\" by Brent Staples. Freire's text links the struggle of oppression to understanding one's position to the world and power central to the educational process and, in my view, to writing (literacy) acquisition.\nStaples writes about how his education did not prevent him from being viewed through gendered and racial stereotypes. There was discussion of words and their constructed meanings, and the professors emphasized how all words only have power when people who use and hear those words are complicit in the construction of the power: blah, blah, blah, and super-­blah.\nSo I asked a person in the classroom, who is a descendant of African slaves in the United States, if he was only offended by the use of the word n***** because he was complicit in creating its derogatory meaning at the moment the professor let the word n***** slip from her lips.\nIt seemed that I just had to merely concede that in the professor's use of the word n*****, she wasn't really acknowledging the racist, violent, and hegemonic social historical, political, and exclusionary affect and effect of the word on me as an African American and others as non–­African Americans in the classroom.\nIt was just a word. Right? Wow! It was like magic!\nWhere had this theory been all my life, especially when I had been subjected to equally derogatory argumentative identity words of bitch, hoe, slut, darkie, dumb, lazy, stupid, fat, and pussy, to name a few?\nI was trying really hard to understand how our class lecture arrived at this vast breach in the classroom knowledge and experience. I was also trying really hard to ignore her, but I am not really good at that, so I went back into the conversation.\n\"Excuse me. I am sorry, but I didn't understand what you said.\" I thought that was a good place to start.\nI looked the professor directly in her eyes, and she showed no signs of retreating. I was new to graduate school and the ways scholars boldly manipulate and use theory to obscure and perpetuate the silence and invisibility of the Other and their experiences.\nThe other groups stopped working, and the class fell silent. The male professor made his way over to our group and positioned himself closer to the female professor. The male professor didn't repeat what his colleague said, but his physical proximity to the professor's body was a show of support, and his colleague went back in for the kill.\n\"N***** is just a word. Rhetoric is a form of communication, and words only carry the meanings that we give to them,\" she explained like she was explaining how to solve a variable equation on the board for the third time. In that moment the professor created a paradigm where our identities and experiences of meaning could not exist simultaneously. My identity and experiences had to die in order for hers to dominate the classroom discourse, her lesson plans, and meanings that she was so well-­meaningly creating for the classroom.\nCue lovely jazz elevator background music.\n***\nLike some first-­generation Black folks one to two generations geographically removed from the U.S. South, I grew up in a segregated northern inner city in the seventies and eighties. It was a place and time where if you could string a well enunciated sentence together and all your verbs conjugated correctly with the help of Schoolhouse Rock's \"Verb: That's What's Happening\" on Saturday mornings, everybody said that you were \"articulate or well-­spoken\" and that you should go to school to become a lawyer.\nSo growing up and throughout the majority of my undergraduate career, attending law school after graduation was my plan. No shade to lawyers, but if believing in the study and practice of law as my career path (along with believing that it would allow me to one day buy a blue Mercedes for my momma because we never had a car and blue was my momma's favorite color) got me out of the South Side of Chicago to become the first person in my family to complete a college degree, then Patricia J. Williams and Johnnie Cochran was where it was at.\nI couldn't really tell anyone that I wanted to be a writer. After undergraduate years of studying English Literature and student activism, I was sincerely convinced that I didn't want to work in a professional field where I could so compassionately empathize why, in some social situations, citizens were set up to break laws and subsequently be subject to inequitable outcomes.\nI could have never imagined that a year later I would be in a graduate composition pedagogy class with a White professor using racial epithets with Montresor's impunity as a methodology for teaching me—­a first-­generation African American female student—­a lesson on argument.\nAnd I thought teaching writing would be a safe space for me as a woman of color. In that moment, the teacher called me a n***** and did it legitimately because it was within her academic freedom and purview. Because rhetorically n***** is just a word. Right? Poverty, homelessness, oppression, learning differences, class differences, and incarceration are just things. Right? Sexual assault, homophobia, bullying, and disabilities are just things. Right? Students are just bodies that we, as teachers, have the power to mold and to control how we want without really seeing who and what they are and the myriad of ways that they may show up.\nMaybe this is what happens when we teach in spaces, and we don't acknowledge and humble our pedagogy and curriculum to the world in which we and our students inhabit. Those worlds can be the same, simultaneous, overlapping, intersecting, or completely isolated.\nThe sad part is that I think that the professor, like many of us who teach, sincerely believed that what she said and did caused absolutely no harm, so I don't write this essay to shame or blame. I write this essay to release myself and others from the trauma experienced in the writing classroom, and maybe through compassion and empathy my experience can heal and inform our field and us (practitioners, teachers) as we work to transform in the changing dynamics of higher education with a focus on social justice, diversity, equity, inclusion, and antiracism to better teach and serve our students and intersecting community members.\nAll views expressed are the author's own.\nThis is excerpted from Traveling without Moving: Essays from a Black Woman Trying to Survive in America by Taiyon J.

    "content": "A federal judge in Fort Worth, Texas, on Friday blocked a new Biden administration rule that would prohibit credit card companies from charging customers late fees higher than $8.\nUS District Judge Mark T. Pittman, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, granted a preliminary injunction to several business and banking organizations that allege the new rule violates several federal statutes.\nThese organizations, led by the right-leaning US Chamber of Commerce, sued the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after the rule was finalized in March. The rule, which was set to go into effect Tuesday, would save consumers about $10 billion per year by cutting fees from an average of $32, the CFPB estimated.\nA preliminary injunction means the rule can’t go into effect until a hearing is held where the case can be adjudicated in greater detail.\n“The credit card lobby’s lawsuit is an attempt to derail a rule that will save families $10 billion each year in order to continue making tens of billions of dollars in profits by charging borrowers late fees that far exceed their actual costs,” a CFPB spokesperson told CNN in a statement. “Consumers will shoulder $800 million in late fees every month that the rule is delayed — money that pads the profit margins of the largest credit card issuers. We will continue to defend this rule so that working families can stop paying excessive late fees that Congress banned more than a decade ago.”\nMaria Monaghan, the counsel for the US Chamber of Commerce Litigation Center, said in a statement Friday that the ruling was “a major win for responsible consumers who pay their credit card bills on time and businesses that want to provide affordable credit,” and that it would “continue to hold the CFPB accountable in court.”\n“It is disappointing that the court has granted this last-ditch effort by the banks to prevent these critical limits on credit card late fees from going into effect next week,” said Chuck Bell, advocacy program director for non-profit Consumer Reports. “Credit card companies have been bilking consumers out of billions of dollars in excessive late fees for far too long.”\nThe rule, first proposed in February 2023, is part of a broader push by the Biden administration to eliminate “junk fees,” considered hidden or misleading charges to consumers.\nThe new rule would apply to large credit card issuers — those with more than 1 million accounts. These companies represent more than 95% of total outstanding credit card debt, according to the CFPB.\nThe push to target credit card fees is part of the Biden administration’s efforts to ease financial burdens for many Americans. Some borrowers, especially millennials and those with lower incomes, have fallen behind on their credit card debt following more than two years of high inflation.\nThe new rule also intended to close a 2010 loophole the CFPB says has been “exploited” by credit card companies to hike fees on late payments.\nAccording to a national Consumer Reports survey published in September, one in five American adults said they had paid a credit card late fee in the previous 12 months. Eighty-two percent said they supported lowering the maximum late fee.\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\nCNN’s Matt Egan contributed to this report.\n",

Shifting our bid will enable us to host a record-breaking Women’s World Cup in 2031 that will help to grow and raise the level of the women’s game both here at home as well as across the globe.”\nThere will still be a congested calendar of international soccer competition in the United States over the next several years.\nThe inaugural FIFA Club World Cup will take place in the country in 2025; the FIFA Men’s World Cup will be coming to North America in 2026 co-hosted by the US, Mexico and Canada; and in 2028, the summer Olympics will take place in Los Angeles.\nMexican Football Federation president Ivar Sisniega said with the experience gained co-hosting the men’s World Cup in 2026, “we will be able to provide the best infrastructure as well as an enthusiastic fan base that will make all the participating teams feel at home and to put together a World Cup that will contribute to the continued growth of women’s football.”\n",

Now an economic slump and the emergence of ferocious local competitors means those bets look less safe as price wars erupt.\nDiscounts and special deals are being offered across consumer brands from food and clothing to consumer electronics and cars, reflecting a dramatic shift in consumption patterns in the world’s second largest economy.\nOne of the most intense price wars is raging in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, where a “life and death” race has manufacturers scrambling for survival.\nTesla’s China market share shrank to 4% in April, almost halving from 7.7% in March, according to data released by the China Passenger Car Association on Friday. Deliveries from its Shanghai factory, its largest globally, fell 18% last month from a year earlier.\nThe sharp drop contrasts with rising sales by its biggest Chinese rival BYD, which reported a 29% jump in pure EV deliveries.\n“Everyone has changed the way they think about China,” said Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder and managing principal at J Capital Research. “The business climate has changed entirely.”\nLast month, Tesla (TSLA) announced aggressive price cuts in the country, shortly after also reducing prices in the United States and Germany. The move added to a series of price reductions that it has made in its biggest overseas market since late 2022.\nLast year, the Chinese economy grew 5.2%. Outside the pandemic years, that was its slowest pace of annual expansion since 1990, when gross domestic product increased only 3.9% because of international sanctions following the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.\nConsumers have curtailed spending as their job and income prospects worsened. A prolonged crisis in real estate, which accounts for 70% of household wealth, and a stock market meltdown have added to their woes.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk makes a surprise visit to China, it coincides with Beijing's auto show where reports suggest he is trying to export his company's self-driving technology. CNN's Marc Stewart has more.\n\nRelated video\nElon Musk makes surprise visit to China, meets senior trade officials\nIn the 1990s, “every company in the West” was hiring consultants and having boardroom meetings about how to do more in China, according to Stevenson-Yang. But now the consultants are gone and rather than talking about how to tap into rapid growth, the C-suite discussions are all about “getting out, protecting one’s operations or balancing supply among several countries.”\n“China now is somewhere around the status of a Brazil — big, important but difficult,” she added.\nThe country’s economic woes aren’t confined to Tesla and the EV industry either. They’re hitting other American corporate giants like Apple (AAPL), Starbucks (STUX) and McDonald’s (MCD): all struggling to adjust their business strategies for a rapidly changing market.\nWorries about the future have forced Chinese consumers to be more budget-conscious, said Yang Wang, senior analyst for Counterpoint Research. As a result, purchases associated with premium or luxury have taken a back seat.\n“Certainly Chinese consumers are experiencing ‘downgraded consumption’ in general,” he said.\nApple’s overall revenue in Greater China — including mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao — fell 8% to $16.4 billion in the fiscal quarter ending March 30.\nMeanwhile, Huawei, a Chinese tech champion that the West once tried to kill off, has been advancing rapidly. Its smartphone sales soared 70% in the first quarter of 2024, boosted by the successful launch of its Mate 60 series, according to data compiled by Counterpoint Research.\nRelated article\nHuawei sales are soaring in China as Apple sinks\n“[China] is the most competitive market in the world,” said Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, at an earnings call with analysts earlier this month. He added that he continues to feel optimistic about the Chinese market in the long term.\nThe US smartphone maker has cut prices for iPhones sold in China, which helped its shipments jump in March, according to data published last week by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, a government-backed research firm. It marked a turnaround from the previous two months of 2024, when Apple saw a deep slump in iPhone sales.\nThe price reductions were led by Apple and third-party retailing platforms, with some iPhone 15 models offered at discounts of as much as 20%.\nCoffee chains have also scrambled to undercut each other’s prices. Last February, Cotti Coffee, a startup founded by two former Luckin Coffee executives, began a campaign to slash latte prices to as low as 9.9 yuan ($1.4).\nThe move prompted Luckin, which is the country’s largest coffee chain, to match that price. Cotti then slashed latte prices again to 8.8 yuan ($1.2).\nThe aggressive discounts have affected global brands. Even Starbucks, which had signalled it had no interest in a price war in China, started offering coupons that effectively lowered its latte prices to below 20 yuan ($2.8). They normally sell for 30 yuan ($4.2).\nRelated article\nIn China’s battle of the lattes, Luckin Coffee keeps beating Starbucks\nThe average check paid by a Starbucks customer declined 9% in China in the first quarter of the year, mainly because of promotions and lower sales of higher priced merchandise, the company said.\n“Our consumers are now more cautious in their spending,” said Belinda Wong, chairwoman and co-CEO of Starbucks China, on an earnings call in January. “You see mass influx of mass market competitors focus on fast store expansion and low price tactics to drive trial.”\nFast food chains have also gotten into the act.\n“Poor man’s deal” has become a trending term among Chinese youth since 2022. It initially referred to McDonald’s “1+1 = 13.9-yuan pair as you wish” $1.90 set meal, which was extremely popular among customers.\nOther Western fast food chains have subsequently jumped on the bandwagon, launching their own low-price set meals.\nOnline guides for getting weekly fast food discounts have gone viral on social media.\n“Mondays at McDonalds for free McNuggets, Tuesdays at Tastien for a ‘one-for-one’ offer, Wednesdays at Dominos for 30% off, Thursdays at KFC for the ‘crazy Thursday’ deal, Fridays at Burger King for a half-priced weekday set deal, then heading to Wallace for the weekends. Repeat next week,” according to one guide.\nNanchengxiang, a Beijing-based fast food chain, has even launched an ultra-cheap “ 3 yuan (41 cents) breakfast buffet,” setting a record low price for all you can eat meals.\nThe set, dubbed by many netizens as “a must-have for poor people working in Beijing,” has more than doubled sales during breakfast hours, according to canyin168, a data tracking and analytical website in the catering industry.\nThe “depressed” consumer sentiment is likely to stay for a while, said Yang from Counterpoint Research.\nSome Western brands “inevitably” will be forced to reconsider pricing to defend market share.\nHowever, that will be “no easy fix,” as foreign brands are at a disadvantage vis-a-vis domestic brands due to higher operating costs, he added.\nRelated article\nChina will focus on ‘high-quality, sustainable growth,’ central bank chief says\nHe doesn’t think they’re likely to pull out of the country though.\nOver the medium to long term, China is still set to drive global economic growth and contribute to the largest growing cohort of middle-class consumers.\n“With depressed economic prospects in most developed countries, and still some catching up to do for key emerging market growth markets like India, China could still offer the most lucrative market globally, even with depressed consumption levels,” he said.\nBut expectations will have to be lowered.\n“I think the fundamental mistake that many Western companies made in China was to believe in the myth of a rising middle class,” said Stevenson-Yang.\n“In reality, Chinese people had a ton of money from capital gains in real estate and the stock market; They never had big increases in income. The economy is not reverting to the poverty levels of the 1980s, but there is a lot of dialing back being done.”\n",

Gen Z (1997-2012), millennial (1981-1996) and Gen X (born between 1965 and 1980) age groups, the trend was roughly the same.\nBy roughly 10 percentage points, the number of men saying they played video games was usually higher among men than women. But Baby Boomers (born 1946-1964) had a different tune.\nWhile half of female Baby Boomers said they played weekly, only 44 percent of Baby Boomer men said the same. And among the Silent Generation (1928-1945), the numbers were about equal, with 30 percent of women playing weekly compared to 29 percent of men.\nKeeping your brain sharp is one key reason Baby Boomers and the Silent Generation might be drawn to play video games despite not growing up with them, but why are more women playing than their male counterparts despite the previous gamer stereotypes?\nAn earlier AARP survey found that the number of older adults playing video games was booming, up from 40.2 million in 2016 to 50.6 million in 2019, and the trend has only escalated.\nA higher number of women might look for brain stimulation in their hobbies than their male counterparts in the Boomer and Silent Gen age range, and they also may rely on games to maintain social connections.\n\"Nearly half of boomers (47 percent) and nearly a third (30 percent) of the silent generation are playing video games regularly,\" Quinn said. \"Older Americans tell us they are more likely to be motivated by keeping their mind sharp than younger gamers, and that's the same for all women despite generation.\"\nBaby Boomers were also the most likely to say video games provide brain stimulation, at 92 percent compared to just 84 percent of Gen Z-ers.\n\"Games improve my critical thinking skills by giving me a chance to solve complex problems,\" one anonymous 37-year-old woman said in the report.\nThe survey also found that gaming was an overwhelmingly white hobby, with 75 percent of players being white compared to just 12 and 19 percent being Black and Hispanic.\n",

I was leaving a friend's house just after 11:00 p.m. and had only made it a few miles when a drunk person driving a truck crossed into my lane and crashed into me at 55 miles per hour, pushing my SUV off the road and into a ditch.\nI often think about what would have happened if I decided to stay longer or leave earlier. Would I still be where I am today? Would the driver crash into someone else instead? I've tried to let these questions go because I cannot change my circumstances and I would not wish that another person had been hurt instead of me.\nAfter the crash occurred, emergency services arrived at the scene and cut me out of my vehicle to put me in a helicopter where I was then taken to the nearest hospital.\nI do not remember much from the crash but I have been burdened with PTSD which makes driving and being a passenger extremely hard. I had various surgeries that repaired my ribs, legs, neck, and lungs. To this day, I still having chronic pain and stress from the events that occurred that day.\nThis whole experience has not only affected me, but those around me also. I may appear like most women my age, but I must face daily unnecessary struggles that I did not ask for. Due to the rate of speed and the type of impact caused, my body will never be the same.\nThe trauma surgeons saved my life that night by putting me back together with hardware in my neck, femur, tibia, foot, and ribs. The impact also caused one of my eyes to cross, which left me with a visual impairment.\nThe most severe injury I had was an Atlanto-occipital dislocation, which in basic terms is an internal decapitation where the skull separates from the spine. I still remember opening my eyes and feeling utter panic while in the hospital. With limited range of motion in my neck and shoulder, driving again was a challenge. I've had to depend on blind spot monitoring in my new vehicle as well as special mirrors.\nDriving while drunk is 100 percent preventable, with so much advancement in technology, people have options to get home safely and should be using them. I have learned from this tragedy that there are good people in life that want to help.\nI found a bigger purpose by sharing my story with MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) to help other survivors and Law Enforcement. There's a great reward for turning my pain into something that might help others. Lastly, I have learned to be grateful for the good days and allow myself grace when my body is in severe pain, when I can't do the things I want or need to do. I believe that we are connected through painful times and I've found ways to look for blessings in this burden.\nStephanie Ronan is an internal decapitation survivor.

    "content": "Summer is almost here, and you’re looking forward to that long-awaited vacation. You can even picture it: ﻿The sun is shining, the waves are rolling gently and you’re curling up with a book.\nPerhaps you’re diving into a steamy romance novel or losing yourself in a page-turning thriller. Maybe a work of romantasy is captivating you instead. Whatever your flavor of escapism, it’s likely that it could be classified as a “beach read” — that oft-dismissed, unofficial category of books that readers gravitate toward in the warmer months.\nBut what exactly constitutes a beach read? And where did that idea come from? Here’s what to know about the popular term.\nA beach read is, naturally, the sort of book one might read at the beach — or at a lake, a resort or another typical summer destination.\nThe books populating “beach read” round-ups from booksellers, publishers and periodicals generally fall into the category of commercial fiction, designed to lure in readers with their saturated covers and playful illustrations. They’re also almost always marketed to women.\nAmanda Bergeron, who acquires contemporary and historical book club fiction for Penguin Random House’s imprint Berkley, has published several authors whose books frequently appear on “beach read” lists: Carley Fortune, Jasmine Guillory and Emily Henry, to name a few. When looking for the next big summer read, Bergeron says she’s drawn to fast-paced stories with compelling characters. If it transports the reader to another location, all the better.\n“It’s something that you’re excited to spend time with and you can’t put down — something that you’re just so eager to get back to that it will go with you wherever you go, whether that’s the park, the pool, the couch, your yard or even the beach,” she says.\nSome books just scream summer, presenting an obvious opportunity to be marketed as a beach read, according to Bergeron. If it takes place in the summer, perhaps on an island or another breezy locale, there’s a good chance it could be a beach read. Sometimes, the “beach read” designation is so fitting that it announces itself in the title, like Fortune’s 2022 romance novel “Every Summer After,” Jenn McKinlay’s 2023 rom-com “Summer Reading” or Henry’s aptly named 2020 “Beach Read.”\nWhile the romance genre tends to dominate the “beach read” landscape, the label isn’t limited to romance, says Bergeron. A beach read can just as easily be a suspenseful thriller or a puzzle-box mystery novel — at least for Bergeron, it’s a book that readers will want to discuss with others and bring along with them on vacation.\nIn other words, a beach read doesn’t ask the reader to ponder the grim realities of the modern world or plunge into the depths of the human experience. Rather, it offers a break from the slog of daily life and the constant drumbeat of depressing news stories.\n“For God’s sake, I do not want to be challenged,” Celeste Ballard declared in a 2014 humor column for The New Yorker about how to pick a summer read. “No ‘hard’ literature that I have to slog through to discover a deep and twisted meaning.”\nEven though the “beach read” designation can go hand in hand with commercial success (books labeled as such frequently make bestseller lists), it’s also a loaded term.\nAuthor Jennifer Weiner, whose books are often categorized as beach reads, rejected the label for years before eventually embracing it — an internal conflict she examined in a 2020 essay for Goodreads.\n“It’s not hard to discern a whiff of Coppertone-scented sexism in the label,” she wrote. “Fast-paced, diverting books that are by or for men are called thrillers or mysteries or sometimes just plain old books, while the ladies get every kind of label, from chick lit to women’s fiction to upmarket women’s fiction to domestic fiction to, well, beach books.”\nBooks labeled as beach reads tend to emphasize plot and characters over elegant prose and heavier themes. To some, the implication is that the book is less serious or less worthy of one’s time.\nDakota Johnson, who launched a book club earlier this year, seemed to echo that assumption in an interview with Bustle: “Our book club is literary fiction. It’s not beach reads. It’s not silly,” she said.\nThough the term “beach read” is commonly associated with frothy romance novels, Bergeron says that notion can be reductive. Beach reads can absolutely be frivolous — sometimes, that’s exactly what you need — but some of the most celebrated beach reads of the past few years explore weightier topics all while delivering on the promise of fun.\nFor instance, Fortune’s 2023 bestseller “Meet Me at the Lake” depicted postpartum anxiety and the loss of a family member, while Kiley Reid’s buzzy 2019 debut “Such A Fun Age” dealt with race and privilege. “A Love Like the Sun,” a forthcoming novel from Riss M. Neilson, includes representation of chronic illness.\n“The fact that writers are able to do all that and offer readers an escape or a big heart hug is just really exciting,” Bergeron says.\nThe term “beach read” first appeared in literary periodicals around 1990, according to an article by the Los Angeles Public Library — though it’s unclear who coined it.\nThe concept of the summer read goes back much further, says Donna Harrington-Lueker, a professor of English and communications at Salve Regina University and author of Books for Idle Hours: Nineteenth-Century Publishing and the Rise of Summer Reading. Though now ingrained in our culture, the notion of summer reading was actually a 19th century invention of the publishing industry that sprung up in response to the creation of the summer vacation.\nSummer reading was initially a ritual enjoyed by rich men, who could afford to engage in leisure travel and unwind with poetry and literature, according to Harrington-Lueker. That changed in the mid-to-late 19th century as the US rapidly industrialized after the Civil War. The construction of railroads and grand hotels made summer vacations more accessible for the middle classes, giving rise to what Harrington-Lueker calls the “summer novel.”\nThe summer novel was specifically geared toward women, Harrington-Lueker explains. The books generally took place over the summer at a resort and tended to follow the rhythms of the season: There might be scenes anchored around a picnic or a fireworks display, with detailed descriptions of what the female characters were wearing. Typically, the books ended with the heroine getting engaged.\n“These become lessons in how you practice summer leisure, and they become very popular,” Harrington-Lueker says.\nThe proliferation of the summer novel also generated backlash from some religious leaders who considered them a temptation and devoid of morality. The Reverend T. De Witt Talmage notably declared in an 1876 sermon that “there is more pestiferous trash read among the intelligent classes in July and August than in all the other ten months of the year.”\n“Would it not be an awful thing for you to be struck with lightning some day when you had in your hand one of these paper-covered romances—the hero a Parisian roué, the heroine an unprincipled flirt … ?” he chided at the time.\nBut throughout the late 1800s, the publishing industry worked to counter such notions and present summer reading as something desirable, Harrington-Lueker says. Magazines such as The Atlantic Monthly or Harper’s ran advertisements with women clad in muslin dresses, novel in hand, while literary critics extolled the benefits of lighter reading.\n“The cakes and ale of literature have their legitimate time and place after the more solid intellectual dishes of the past season have been digested,” an 1887 editorial in the literary review Book Buyer reads.\nMuch like today, summer reads at the time were seen as an escape from the turmoil of the real world. One 1885 magazine column Harrington-Lueker encountered in her research called that summer’s novels “peculiarly trivial” and hypothesized that publishers were responding to the cholera epidemic, believing “that the general mind will be so far distraught by anxiety as to have no attention to spare for being critical.”\nAs publishers solidified the association between summer and light reading, some institutions promoted more serious reading during the season, Harrington-Lueker said.\nOne notable example is the Chautauqua movement, a late 19th and early 20th century educational program that sought to help Americans improve themselves through reading. From schools requiring students to read so-called classics in the summer to the anti-racist reading lists that were ubiquitous in 2020, the idea of summer as a time for personal enrichment persists today. Indeed, some people reach for heftier titles during vacation precisely because they finally have the time to dig into them.\n“Summer reading becomes a point where people automatically begin to think, ‘How should we be spending our summer? Should we be spending it with escapist fiction that’s going to renew us, that’s going to give us this time apart from a more difficult world? Or should we be using it to engage with topics of more consequence?’” Harrington-Lueker says.\nThat push and pull between reading as escapism and reading as enrichment has long been a part of American culture, Harrington-Lueker adds. In recent years, she says she’s observed that the titles appearing on summer reading lists from The New York Times, Oprah’s Book Club and other cultural tastemakers seem less escapist than they were in previous years.\nBut from Bergeron’s perspective, plenty of readers are still looking for a respite — and this year’s offerings (she name-checked Ashley Poston’s “A Novel Love Story,” Kirsty Greenwood’s “The Love of My Afterlife” and Tia Williams’ “A Love Song for Ricki Wilde”) give them plenty of opportunities to do so.\n“Readers want to be transported,” she says. “(When you think of an) escape often you think light, but I think it’s the ability to inhabit another world or another set of shoes and just spend time in those pages.”\nAt a time when the world feels uncertain and overwhelming, Bergeron says, the beach read beckons.\n",

    "content": "An interactive map shows how Connecticut may be affected by sea level rise as climate change worsens.\nThe projections by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are incorporated in a national map showing that rising sea levels could encroach on several areas of the state. The map allows the viewer to see how different parts of the U.S., as well as individual states, may be affected if sea levels rise by different amounts up to 10 feet. It also calculates how populated areas would fare amid the rising levels.\nAreas marked in blue show the areas of Connecticut that could be submerged if sea levels do not stop rising.\nConnecticut is just one state facing significant challenges as sea levels continue to rise because of climate change. Coastal communities are particularly at risk. A combination of increasing temperatures, melting ice caps and thermal expansion of seawater is contributing to accelerated sea level rise, which is expected to have profound effects on the state.\nOver 61 percent of the state's population resides in coastal areas, according to the state's Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, and nearly 30 percent work within these regions.\nNeighboring states New Jersey and New York are also at risk. In fact, the map shows that much of the Eastern U.S. would be inundated with water if sea levels were to rise by just 3 feet.\nAt that point, water would start to go inland toward Connecticut's capital, Hartford, the map shows.\nA report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the United States is expected to experience as much sea level rise in the next 30 years as it did over the entire past century. This projection indicates that Connecticut's shoreline could see an additional 8 to 10 inches of sea level rise by 2050, with the worst-case scenario predicting up to 15 inches.\nHigh-tide flooding is already a concern in coastal Connecticut cities like New London and Bridgeport. These areas are experiencing more frequent flooding events, which are expected to increase as sea levels rise, according to data from the Yale Center on Climate Change and Health.\nConnecticut's response to sea level rise involves a combination of local initiatives and state-level planning. The state's adopted sea level change scenario predicts a rise of 1 foot 8 inches by 2050. This guides municipalities in preparing evacuation plans, hazard mitigation strategies and revisions to conservation and development plans.\nConnecticut has taken significant steps to prepare for the impact of sea level rise caused by climate change. Several projects involving community engagement, scientific research and strategic planning aim to enhance the state's resilience and protect its coastal communities from the increasing threat of flooding and rising tides.\n",

In the ensuing months of war, more than 34,500 people have died in Gaza and about 80 percent of the population has been displaced, according to the latest figures from the Associated Press.\nMorgan and his guests were talking about the pro-Palestinian protests at college campuses around the United States which have led to hundreds of arrests. Morgan spoke about Jewish students at the colleges who had allegedly been harassed by the protesters.\n\"All you wanna talk about is the Jewish students,\" West told Morgan, insisting he should focus on Israel's actions in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis it has caused. \"Then, in fact, you become an extension of propaganda, and that's why I call you a racist because it means then that Palestinian lives do not have the same value as an Israeli life.\"\nMorgan snapped, \"How dare you?\" to West, refuting his accusations of racism.\n\"How dare you call me a racist. What you don't know is before I did this debate, I did a long interview with one of the IDF spokesmen in which I went after him about their planned invasion of Rafah because I think it would be a catastrophic mistake. So don't call me a racist,\" Morgan said.\nFollowing another heated exchange, Morgan said, \"I believe Palestinian lives matter just as much as any other life and I've always said that,\" to which West replied, \"Does not manifest in your framing, brother. Does not manifest in your framing.\"\nMorgan added, \"Don't throw around the word 'racist' without any evidence to support the fact that I'm a racist.\"\n\"I've been hearing the evidence,\" West told him. \"It's not throwing around. It's the reality.\"\nMorgan was formerly a host on TV breakfast show Good Morning Britain until he dramatically walked off-air during a live segment in 2021 where one of his co-presenters accused him of being racist over his views on Megan Markle.\nRead more: Earn Cash Back for Streaming Services\nHe has openly shared his views on Israel's military attacks on Gaza online.\n\"The oppression of Palestinian people has been totally unacceptable, and peace will never be possible until they are afforded freedom & equality. But it should be possible to believe that, and to condemn the horrifying terror attacks on Israel on Oct 7,\" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter, almost three weeks after Hamas' attack.\nHis coverage of the war has proved divisive, though.\n\"The person covering Palestine-Israel best is ... Piers Morgan?\" asked Aymann Ismail in a column for Slate.\n\"Morgan's approach seems simple enough: have on the program as many people from as wide an array of opinions as possible, and let them make their case to him on the air,\" wrote Ismail. \"He gives each guest a considerable amount of airtime too, some stretching beyond 30 minutes—which may not sound like a lot until you compare it to other segments on broadcast news, which rarely surpass a few minutes before moving on.\"\nIsmail continued: \"At a time when social media bubbles often exacerbate polarization and misinformation, Morgan's seemingly sincere commitment to fostering meaningful dialogue stands out.\"\nBut Mohamad Elmasry, a professor of Media Studies at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies does not agree.\n\"The British talk show host deserves credit for featuring pro-Palestinian voices, but interview successes are owed mostly to the talent of his guests refuting his Israeli talking points,\" he wrote for the Middle East Eye in November.\n\"It is probably true that he has given more space for Palestine supporters than anyone else in mainstream western media,\" Elmasry wrote, but \"Morgan has not been nearly as balanced or fair as he implies, however.\"\nElmasry argued that Morgan seemed more likely to push back on pro-Palestinian guests while giving \"softball\" questions to those who were pro-Israeli.\n",

It has also brought concerns about the possible use of nuclear weapons back into the spotlight.\nProminent Russian officials, such as former President Dmitry Medvedev, and Russian state television commentators have frequently mentioned the prospect of nuclear war.

Lively directed Swift's \"I Bet You Think About Me\" music video in November 2021 and has attended numerous Eras Tour concerts.\nLively and Reynolds' oldest daughter, James, made her musical debut in Swift's song \"Gorgeous.\" The track was featured on the 2017 album reputation, with James lending her vocals to the track's intro. Swift also paid homage to three of Lively's children—James, Inez and Betty—in the track \"betty\" from her Folklore album.\nNow Swift has delighted fans by mentioning the three children again, this time during an Eras Tour concert in Madrid on Wednesday. The singer-songwriter has strayed from her regular schedule to perform two shows at Estadio Santiago Bernabéu in Spain.\nNewsweek emailed Swift and Lively's individual publicists for comment on Thursday.\nDuring her Folklore set, Swift mentioned the three young girls by name, which can be seen in a video uploaded to TikTok by user @musicsociety.\n\"I have to say that on Folklore some of my favorite characters are named James, Inez and Betty,\" the pop star said as the crowd screamed in excitement.\nAt the time of writing, the video had been viewed 701,200 times.

She was also seen enjoying the show alongside sisters Alana, Este and Danielle Haim from the band HAIM.\nDespite Lively and Reynolds welcoming their fourth child in February 2023, the public remains unaware of both the name and sex. Reynolds previously joked about Swift's influence on the names of their children when he said he's \"waiting\" for the singer-songwriter to tell him the name of their fourth child.\n\"Taylor Swift keeps dropping [your kids' names] into lyrics, so just tell us this: Is the fourth child's name, the baby's name, anywhere on the new record?\" Today host Savannah Guthrie asked Reynolds on the May 13 episode.\n\"We always wait for Taylor to tell us what the child's name will be. And I'll say this, we're still waiting, so Taylor, let's maybe start [on that], you know,\" he joked. \"She's a prolific writer. I mean, what are we doing here?

It said Russia lost 22 armored personnel vehicles in the past day, bringing the total number to 14,913.\nBoth Moscow and Kyiv have lost significant amounts of personnel and equipment amid a recent ramped up push by Russia in Ukraine's east to seize territory. Kyiv said this month it had stabilized the situation on the front line after the Kremlin's forces kick-started an offensive in the Kharkiv region on May 10, seizing a number of villages on Ukraine's northeastern frontier.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has claimed that Russian losses during its Kharkiv offensive were eight times higher than Ukraine's.

    "content": "On the rare days that the hills surrounding Port-au-Prince fall silent, people notice.\n“If you can’t hear shooting somewhere, the gangs are probably running low on ammunition,” a police source in the Haitian capital told CNN. “But when there’s a lot of shooting, they’ve definitely received a fresh shipment.”\nFor over two months, Port-au-Prince has been cut off from the world, its international seaport and airport shuttered following an explosion of gang attacks in late February. All major roads are blocked by gang checkpoints. For most people living here, there is no way out – and no way to bring in desperately needed food and medicine.\nEncircling the Caribbean nation is another closed perimeter, this one created by Haiti’s neighbors. The Dominican Republic has sealed the island’s shared border and airspace. The Bahamas has launched a naval blockade to keep Haitians from fleeing the crisis by boat; the UK has sent a warship to ward off anyone seeking refuge in Turks and Caicos, a British overseas territory; and the US state of Florida has increased marine and aviation patrols.\nAnd yet guns, bullets and drugs keep pouring in, crossing international waters and airspace to reach the embattled country – most of the firepower originating from the US.\n“Haiti doesn’t produce guns and ammunition, yet the gang members don’t seem to have any trouble accessing those things,” says Pierre Esperance, executive director of Haiti’s National Human Rights Defense Network.\nSince the start of the year, thousands of people have been killed in gang-related violence and hundreds kidnapped, including at least 21 children, UN figures show. Stopping the flow of guns to Haiti would likely have an immediate impact on the bloodshed, according to police and human rights experts.\n“We have to cut the gangs’ weapons supply lines. This is absolutely the most important thing now,” the police source told CNN. “Because when they don’t have bullets, their machine guns become nothing more than clubs.”\nAnd as a Kenyan-led multinational security support force (MSS) prepares to deploy to Haiti, starving the gangs of ammunition should be a top priority for the US, says William O’Neill, the UN Designated Expert of the High Commissioner on the situation of Human Rights in Haiti.\n“All of these countries that are contributing their young men and women (to the MSS), how can we make it safer for them to do their job? One way the US could help immediately and directly would be to really seriously crack down on the flow of illegal weapons,” he said.\n“The gangs have literally nothing else; their only currency is intimidation and fear.”\nEighteen months ago, the UN Security Council imposed an arms embargo on Haiti, which bans the export of weapons to anyone in the country other than the government. The US has also taken independent steps to crack down on illicit exports, appointing a regional coordinator for firearms prosecution in the Caribbean and a special unit to investigate transnational crimes in Haiti.\nYet the guns keep coming. In January, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) warned that Haiti-bound firearms and ammunition were being “routinely incorporated into outbound shipments at warehouses near seaports and airports” in Florida, citing interviews with US customs officials.\nRelated article\nGangs forced out Haiti’s government. This FBI ‘Most Wanted’ gang leader claims they’re liberating the country\nThe following month, Haiti’s gangs put their weapons to devastating use, taking the country hostage in an explosion of coordinated violence that forced then-Prime Minister Ariel Henry to resign, and led to the creation of a transitional governing council that has so far been mired in disagreement.\n“The planes have not stopped flying. There continue to be exchanges of both ammunition and arms across the border,” Sylvie Bertrand, the UNODC regional representative, told CNN recently, urging the global community to enforce the arms embargo.\nBut amid today’s chaos, experts say it is likely becoming easier than ever for the gangs to resupply, as they now control major routes and infrastructure to bypass official controls.\n“There are always weapons coming in. There are always bullets,” Vitel’homme Innocent, leader of the Kraze Baryé gang, told CNN in April, his masked entourage bristling with a globally manufactured assortment of firepower.\nWeapons experts who later analyzed some of CNN’s images from the encounter said they could spot weapons and accessory parts originating from Israel, Turkey, the Czech Republic, probably Brazil – and, overwhelmingly, from the United States.\nThe guns Haiti’s gangs wield are a mix of stolen and smuggled, and the United States is by far the main source of the latter, according to UN experts.\nFrom 2020 to 2022, over 80% of the weapons seized in Haiti and submitted to US authorities for tracing were manufactured in or imported from the United States, UNODC reported in January, citing the most-recent available tracing data.  They are typically purchased in the US from federally licensed retail outlets, gun shows or pawn shops through “straw man” intermediaries, the agency also found.\nIt’s all part of a phenomenon that experts in Latin America and the Caribbean call the “iron river” – a flood of guns bought in US states with lax gun laws, and then shipped across the region to criminal groups. The Mexican government, which has been outspoken about the issue, currently has a $10 billion lawsuit pending against several US gun manufacturers whose products, it says, arm powerful cartels.\nA senior agent at the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), which investigates the diversion of lawfully purchased guns to illegal ends, told CNN that Miami is a significant source of weapons sent to Haiti, which have historically been trafficked in small freighters by family networks.\n“Those are difficult to enforce because they’re not your typical commercial freighter… it’s relatively easy to conceal a small number of firearms in those shipments,” he said. Texas, Louisiana, and Georgia are also sources of weapons trafficked to the Caribbean, where the ATF has a specialized gun intelligence unit to track and stop such flows, he added.\nAsked whether the US was doing enough, he emphasized that combatting gun trafficking was a top priority. “It is a very high priority of the United States government and ATF’s role in that, to stem the flow of illegal firearms, whether domestic or international, and particularly places like Haiti where the rule of law is under extreme threat.”\nIn January, Joly Germine – leader of the gang 400 Mawozo – pleaded guilty to US charges over a gunrunning scheme that saw dozens of rifles, handguns and a shotgun purchased legally in Florida under false pretenses, and smuggled into Haiti.\nFrom above, traces of Haiti’s extensive smuggling networks come into focus: the scars of a clandestine airstrip in its sun-bleached Central Plateau, a dock jutting from gang-held territory into the still waters of the Gulf of Gonave.\nSea and air are the main means of transport for the guns and the drugs trans-shipments that fund more weapons purchases, experts say. And while Haitian authorities have seen some successes in seizing illicit cargo over the years, the dramatic peaks and plains of this “land of mountains” add difficulty for an already understaffed police force and customs agency.\nHaiti’s secluded and sparsely populated rural areas are ideal for landings and take-offs by small planes aiming to avoid observation. There are at least 11 known informal or clandestine airstrips in the country, according to UNODC, many originally built for humanitarian purposes following the country’s devastating 2010 earthquake.\n“Here, you don’t have anything around you. So, you just go, probably in the middle of the night, with a couple vehicles parked on each side of the improvised runway so the pilot can identify the area. They land, drop off or pick up stuff, and take off again all outside of Haitian jurisdiction,” a security expert in Port-au-Prince told CNN.\nThe sea is the preferred option for arms smugglers given the weight of their cargo. Haiti’s roughly horseshoe shape offers over 1,100 miles of coastline, a challenging distance to comprehensively patrol for Haiti’s coast guard.\nHaiti’s south in particular has emerged as a strategic location for smugglers, the UNODC reported in April, offering entry points for cocaine from South America, cannabis from Jamaica and firearms from across the region.\n“One popular method of moving illegal products involves “banana boats,” go-fast vessels that arrive at night, beach on coastal banana plantations, and are subsequently destroyed after unloading their cargo,” the UNODC report details.\nGuns and ammunition that arrive in the south are frequently sent onward to Port-au-Prince via the gang-controlled Route National 3, it also said, identifying the Mariani gang, Grand Ravine gang, and 5 Segond gang as “major players in the organization and distribution of arms, munitions and drugs.”\nIn 2022, 5 Segond group attacked Haiti’s largest flour mill. It would have been an incongruous target if not for its location, positioned right next to Port-au-Prince Bay with a large jetty to accept deliveries. Just about a mile inland lies a major highway, and in between the two is a massive warehouse; a perfect distribution set-up for any import entrepreneur.\nToday, the entire area is controlled by 5 Segond, with security sources telling CNN that they believe the mill has been taken over and no longer functions.\n“Izo has the jetty, so he has access to the sea. And boats keep coming in and out of that area, which again is completely controlled by his gang… and is kept under tight control, with barricades in the surroundings,” the same security expert said, referring to 5 Segond’s rapper frontman Andre Johnson, who often posts videos of gang members flashing guns and paramilitary gear set to music on social media.\nContraband arriving via secretive small boats and planes is just part of the picture. Last month, Haitian National Police and Customs agents seized more than two dozen firearms, including 12 assault rifles, and nearly a thousand cartridges from a shipping container that had arrived in Haiti’s northern city of Cap Haitien.\nDrugs and arms smuggling has a long history in Haiti, much of it facilitated through official channels by government agents and even, in one 2022 case, by a rogue Episcopal church staffer who allegedly hid guns and thousands of rounds in a shipping container reportedly labeled as church donations, before it was seized by customs agents in Port-au-Prince.\nCustoms officials trying to do their job on the front lines in Haiti can face threats to their lives. In 2018, local press reported that several customs agents at the Malpasse border crossing between the Dominican Republic and Haiti were burned alive after an argument erupted in the course of a cargo inspection.\nAllegations of smuggling and gang affiliations have also been made at the highest levels of Haiti’s government. Four former Haitian senators have been sanctioned by the US for alleged drug trafficking, as have multiple past presidents and prime ministers of Haiti for allegedly financing the country’s gangs. They’re part of what gang leader Innocent refers to as the country’s “oligarchs,” who historically created and armed local gangs to become their enforcers-for-hire as they profited from white-collar crime schemes.\n“As a Haitian human rights defender, I can’t say that all the responsibility for these guns is on the US – I think it’s the Haitian government too. They need to regain control of the port, they need to control customs. The problem is corruption,” says Esperance, the human rights advocate.\nRelated article\nHunger in Haiti is spreading amid gang violence, aid workers warn\nThat’s why, he says, the planned deployment of an international police force to restore calm to Haiti is destined to fail unless the US and global community also commit to fighting corruption, building frameworks for good governance, and closing legal loopholes abused by the country’s elite.\n“Now, of course, the government is completely destabilized, it’s easy for the gangs to smuggle weapons themselves. But how did they begin? Just two years ago, smuggling was going through official channels, and it happened that way because everyone was corrupt,” Esperance said.\nBertrand, the UNODC representative, also emphasized the importance of building up Haiti’s institutions as its new government takes shape. Her agency is working to strengthen the country’s customs authority and coast guard, for example, including providing much-needed equipment from protective gear to cargo scanners.\n“It’s time for people in Haiti to live peacefully – for their kids to go back to school, for them to be able to eat every day.” And that means, she says, ensuring that “national authorities are well-trained, well-equipped, and ready to face and curb down the level of violence.”\nCNN reached out to Homeland Security Investigations, part of the US Department of Homeland Security; the US Department of Commerce’s Office of Export Enforcement, Haiti’s National Police and Haiti’s General Customs Administration for comment.\n",

    "content": "Editor's note: This column is part of 'Why Do We?' — a weekly video series hosted by culture expert Martin Lindstrom that untangles unique quirks of human behavior. Click here for the full series page.\nIt's not every day I get the chance to sit down with a Nobel laureate, but the challenging question raised by Newsweek left me no choice. Why do we procrastinate on taxes?\nWhether we like to admit it, we've all been there. Breaking up, fixing that dripping tap, learning that new skill — the list goes on. A friend of mine recently procrastinated on his health check, likely suspecting that the message he would receive wouldn't be rosy. According to a recent study, 20 to 25 percent of the adult population procrastinates regularly, while a staggering 70 to 95 percent of all students report procrastinating on academic tasks.\nAnd then there's that dreaded tax return hanging over our heads.\nSo I sat down with economist Richard Thaler — recipient of the 2017 Nobel Prize for his pioneering contributions to behavioral economics and best-selling author of the book, Nudge. Thaler's work fundamentally challenged the traditional economic assumption that individuals always act rationally, laying the groundwork for the concept of \"nudge theory.\" Since procrastination is itself irrational, Thaler seemed the perfect choice to help me get to the bottom of my quandary.\nFrom the onset, Thaler wasn't anything like what I was expecting from a Nobel laureate. Despite the seriousness of his work, I found Thaler fun and approachable. When I asked him about the Prize, he merely laughed and told me that he assumed the Nobel committee in Stockholm probably couldn't get hold of their first choice, so he got the call as a last minute stand-in. Despite his self-deprecatory nature, it didn't take more than a few minutes with Thaler to see his brilliant mind at work.\nBut back to taxes.\nDid you know that if you just inform the tax authorities that you'll be filing late, in most instances nothing will happen? But we choose instead to procrastinate, incurring penalties which could just as easily have been cleared up with a dose of candor and honesty!\nJoin my conversation with Richard Thaler where we cover everything from urinals, Richard's love affair with a sound button, and of course his take on why we procrastinate.\n",

    "content": "Wisconsin Republicans reacted to former President Donald Trump reportedly calling Milwaukee \"a horrible city\" during a closed-door meeting on Thursday.\nTrump visited the U.S. Capitol for the first time since his supporters sieged the building on January 6, 2021, in a failed attempt to halt certification of President Joe Biden's victory. The ex-president met with GOP lawmakers as a precursor to the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee—set for July 15 to July 18—where Trump is expected to be chosen as the party's nominee.\nJake Sherman, founder of Punchbowl News who covers the Hill, reported on X, formerly Twitter, that Trump told House Republicans on Thursday, \"Milwaukee, where we are having our convention, is a horrible city.\"\nTrump spokesperson Steven Cheung responded to Sherman's reporting to X on Thursday, writing, \"Wrong. Total bull****. He never said it like how it's been falsely characterized as. He was talking about how terrible crime and voter fraud are.\"\nNewsweek reached out to Cheung via email for comment on Thursday.\nHouse Republicans from Wisconsin defended Trump but shared different interpretations of the former president's comment.\n\"Another classic example of s****y reporting by a Democratic Party shill pretending to be a journalist. Lies busy omission. @realDonaldTrump was specifically referring to the crime the CRIME RATE in Milwaukee,\" Representative Derrick Van Orden wrote on X.\nVan Orden included a photo of a Spectrum News article titled, \"Milwaukee ranks third for violent crimes nationwide,\" from May 2023.\nSherman shared an April article from Wisconsin Public Radio titled, \"Homicides in Milwaukee down nearly 50 percent compared to 2 years ago.\"\nSome said that Trump was referring to election integrity. After Trump lost to Biden in 2020, he claimed that the election was rigged against him. Biden won Wisconsin by a slim 0.7 percent margin, and there is no evidence to suggest there was election fraud in Wisconsin or any widespread fraud in 2020.\nRepresentative Scott Fitzgerald told Matt Smith, political director of WISN, a Milwaukee ABC affiliate, that Trump's comment was delivered after a question posed to him about election integrity: \"What he was talking about was the elections in Milwaukee. They're concerned about them.\"\nLawrence Andrea, Washington correspondent for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, said on X that Representative Glenn Grothman told him that Trump was \"concerned about the election in MKE\" and \"felt we need to do better in urban centers around the country.\"\nRepresentative Bryan Steil said on X: \"I was in the room. President Trump did not say this. There is no better place than Wisconsin in July.\"\nSteil told Smith, \"He wasn't talking about the city. He was talking about specific issues in the city,\" before the congressman listed issues such as crime and the public school system but would not say which issues Trump mentioned, according to the clip Smith shared on X.\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, a Democrat, told reporters on Thursday, \"Donald Trump wants to talk about things that he thinks are horrible, all of us lived through his presidency, so right back at ya, buddy.\"\nJohnson called Trump \"unhinged\" for making the comment and said he was \"wrong\" about Milwaukee.\nBiden seized the chance to score some points with Wisconsinites, posting to X on Thursday, \"I happen to love Milwaukee,\" to which Johnson replied, \"Milwaukee loves you back, President Joe Biden!\"\n",

    "content": "It was 2020 and, for some of us, the worst year of our lives. But, as the Disturbed song goes: \"Sometimes, darkness can show you the light\".\nWith all that unfolded around us during the COVID pandemic, I found myself at 500lbs and with a job that had me traveling from home to hotels to hospitals, even though most of the world was shut down.\nI had always been overweight from a young age. In fact, I can't remember a time when I wasn't. But this was the largest I had ever been. I wore a 6XL shirt—I'm large and tall, so it was more like a 7XL because they always ran big—and had a 64-inch waist.\nSo when I was home, I was stuck in my office frustrated, scared, and uncertain of what was next. I lost several friends to COVID, and working in hospitals fueled everything that was going on in my head.\nWas I next? Would I infect my family? I was frightened.\nMy wife urged us to go for a walk, suggesting that we stay away from other people and perhaps head into the woods. That is when I realized how out of shape I was.\nWe walked a block: I was out of breath, my back and feet hurt, and it was a struggle for me. My wife was in much better shape than me. We'd been married for 27 years at that point, and you get to know a person and what drives them.\nMy wife never allowed me to quit. Every day, she would ask: \"You want to go for a walk?\" If I said no, I'd feel like I let her down, so I never did.\nAmazingly, before I knew it, I'd lost 75lbs. It's a drop in the bucket when you weigh 500lbs, and I'd lost weight before only to gain it back. The last time I gained weight back, so I made a promise: If I ever lost weight again, I would never gain it back.\nI knew what I had to do, and walking seemed to be the thing that allowed me to lose weight. I am driven and competitive, and if you tell me I can't, I will prove otherwise. I'm sure my wife knows that too; she has helped me fuel that fire.\nI started walking everywhere. The only time I used my car was when I had to drive to the next hotel or hospital for work.\nThe funny thing about walking is it allows you to clear your mind, and it highlights the beauty around us. When you drive, you focus on what is ahead. But when you walk, you have the opportunity to see everything.\nWalking also allowed me to hold myself accountable with food. If I had a craving for a large steak and cheese extra greasy—I mean, what other way is there to have one?—I would walk a mile to the sub place, enjoy my meal, and walk back and not feel guilty.\nI called it accountability. There's nothing worse than trying to lose weight and having a craving, so I didn't ignore that craving, I fed it. But the accountability freed me from the remorse afterward that usually led to more eating. I'd earned it.\nThe only time I felt remorse was when I didn't walk, so I walked every day. I started with a block, then a mile, then two miles. And every day I would push myself further. The next thing I knew, it was 5km every day.\nThis led me to find new places to walk. I started walking in the woods, parks, trails. I even got an app to show me what was available no matter where I was. It was exciting; where will I discover next?\nI used to laugh when people would say they went for a walk in the woods. I would say: \"Why?\" I get it now.\nPerspective: that's a huge word for me and one that has changed the way I live and how I see the world. Until you put yourself in someone else's sneakers, you will never have the perspective on what makes them who they are and why they do the things they do.\nI took a job with a small startup that gave me the opportunity to travel the world. It was then I realized I had to document my journey of weight loss and personal growth, so I started the \"Walking the World\" group on Facebook.\nThe goal was to use the Facebook group to drive me forward and hold myself accountable. People around me started to notice what I was doing, and their support only drove me more. \"Hey I saw you walking, keep it up, looking good.....proud of you.\"\nI traveled to the Netherlands and walked from one end of the country to the other, from Groningen to Amsterdam and Rotterdam. I did 45,000 steps walking in Amsterdam alone one night. What an amazing city Amsterdam is, especially at night.\nThen I was off to Paris, France. I arrived at 9 a.m. but the hotel room wasn't ready so I walked to the Eiffel Tower and had a French roast coffee and a chocolate croissant. Again, accountability through walking and no regret—it was amazing.\nWalking back, I was able to catch Vice President Kamala Harris and her motorcade driving past me on her visit to the Institut Pasteur.\nNext stop was Lyon in France and the Parc de la Tête d'or and the amazing waterfront. Lyon is a beautiful city. With COVID restrictions ending, locals had set up restaurants on boats in the waterways for open seating. It was amazing to see how other countries handled the COVID crisis.\nThen I was in London, England when my first stop was Abbey Road. Music has always been a huge part of my life and I don't know if I could have accomplished any of this without it.\nAs I approached, I sang \"All You Need Is Love,\" only to have other people join in. It was when I realized the world around us has a soundtrack; if you listen closely, you will hear it. We all have our own soundtrack.\nThe day I hit my ideal weight and was approved to have all the extra skin taken from my abdomen, I celebrated like I only could: I hiked the Wishbone Trail from Carver to Plymouth in Massachusetts; 13 miles of every terrain possible.\nIt was like when you watch the final group on the TV show Survivor as they look back at the journey they had just traveled. It gave me strength and clarity. It spoke to me and said: If you want something bad enough and you never give up, you will accomplish it.\nI have walked all across the U.S. and Canada and made a trip to Manchester, England.\nI have put a map of the world on my office wall and every time I walk somewhere new I put a pin in. Someday, I will fill that map.\nI am often asked: How much weight did you lose and what is your weight now?\nI have lost over 217lbs so far, but the journey is ongoing. Along with the weight loss I am working to build muscle. When you lose that much weight you also lose muscle mass, so it's important to build that back as well. How much you weigh is important, but quality of life and the things you can do outweigh that number.\nMy doctor told me I have added 40lbs of muscle and that is not the norm, but my body type is not one of a small man. I am 6'1 with a 14 EEEE size shoe. At some point, it is less about the number and more about your health and all of the things I can do now that I have never been able to do before.\nDon't get me wrong: I still step on the scale. But the mirror and my doctor are better indicators of my progress now. This journey is ongoing and will be part of my everyday life. I moved to Philadelphia after living all of my life South of Boston.\nMy new adopted home has welcomed me and the people in the city of brotherly love have been amazing. I have a granddaughter and a grandson on the way here, and living here allows me to enjoy every moment with them. Having the stamina to keep up with them is glorious.\nMy daughter is getting married this year. I was asked to be the officiant for her wedding and I am working extra hard to look good, and I am going to dance the night away. There's always something new and exciting on this journey.\nI have made it my goal to empower others to never give up. I am not an influencer, I am an empowerer. I will never tell you what is right for you, I will only tell you that if you want something bad enough: Yes you can. It is never easy and the journey may be long, but if you never give up: Yes you can.\nThis journey did not happen overnight. You have to start somewhere. I started walking a block and eventually hiked 13 miles, but I never quit and never gave up. I have a lot of people to thank for that.\nAll of you who honked your horns as I walked around town, and who encouraged me to keep moving—thank you.\nA family friend who had not seen me in over a year almost rear-ended someone because he couldn't believe what he saw. Please keep your eyes on the road, and thank you.\nNow it's time for me to pay it back and that is why I wrote this. I want you to know, yes you can, just keep moving. Find your soundtrack and turn it up to 11 (Spinal Tap reference, FYI) because it's contagious.\nI am proof of that.\nTake a moment to listen to your soundtrack and that of the world around you. If you don't like what you hear, own it because only you can change it.\nEric Pupek is a husband, father and grandfather who changed his life one step at a time, walking the world.\nAll views expressed are the author's own.\n",

Ham was hired just two years ago and had taken the team to the Western Conference Finals a year ago, but in the world that is the Lakers, that isn't good enough. Los Angeles demands excellence from its team and coaching staff, something Ham couldn't live up to.\nHe came under fire this past season due to his inability to make in-game adjustments when needed. Ham also never took accountability for his mistakes, something that rubbed the players and organization the wrong way.\nLos Angeles will now be looking for their third head coaching hire since 2020 and they are hoping the third time is the charm. Los Angeles wants stability at the coaching position, but the club's inability to identify the right person for the job has been troubling.\nRumors have been flying about the potential of them going after Tyronn Lue if he is let go by the Los Angeles Clippers, but all signs point to the two sides staying together.\nIn fact, Lue mentioned that he hopes to stay with the Clippers for a long time. He has built up strong relationships with members of the Clippers' front office and would love to continue working alongside them, per Ohm Youngmisuk and Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN:\nLue likely staying with the Clippers would serve as a blow to the Lakers' plans. But even if Lue did want to join the Lakers, Los Angeles would need to give the Clippers some type of compensation, unless he was fired. Clippers owner Steve Ballmer isn't just going to hand Lue over to the inter-city rivals so a firing is unlikely.\nThe connection that Lue has with Lakers superstar LeBron James has made him their primary target. Lue led James' Cleveland Cavaliers clubs to three consecutive NBA Finals appearances from 2016-18, including a win in '16.\nBut Los Angeles will likely have to look elsewhere for its new head coach. Names such as Mike Budenholzer, Kenny Atkinson, and JJ Redick have surfaced for the Lakers, but they are expected to take their time executing interviews.\nThe hope for the Lakers is that they can find the right person to lead the ship forward, maximizing the potential of the roster that the front office puts together. James can become a free agent this summer as well, but all indications are that he will remain with the team for his final few years in the NBA. As it always is for the Lakers, it will be a drama-filled summer but one that could dictate how the next decade goes for this franchise.\n",

    "content": "A new poll spells potential trouble for former President Donald Trump as he stands trial in Manhattan in his criminal hush money case.\nTrump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, became the first former president in U.S. history to stand trial in a criminal case last month. Following an investigation by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office, Trump was indicted in March 2023 on 34 charges of allegedly falsifying business records relating to hush money payments that were made to adult film star Stormy Daniels during his 2016 presidential campaign. Daniels alleges she had an affair with Trump in 2006, which he has denied. The former president has pleaded not guilty to all charges and said the case against him is politically motivated.\nDespite Trump's legal troubles, which include three other criminal indictments—all of which he has pleaded not guilty to—it remains a tight race in the polls between the former president and his likely challenger in November, President Joe Biden, the Democratic incumbent.\nHowever, this can change if Trump is convicted. According to an ABC News/Ipsos poll produced by Langer Research Associates and conducted between April 25 to 30 that was published on Sunday, 80 percent of Trump's supporters said they will continue to stand by him if he was convicted of a felony in the hush money case. Meanwhile, 20 percent of his base would either reconsider their support (16 percent) or withdraw their support of Trump (4 percent).\nThe sample size of the subgroup of Trump supporters was 937 adults with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4. The national sample size of the poll was 2,260 adults and the margin of error for the full sample was 2 percentage points. Of the national sample size, 31 percent were Democrats, 29 percent were Republicans and 28 percent were independents.\nNewsweek reached out to Trump's and Biden's campaigns as well as political experts via email for comment.\nMeanwhile, results varied in a matchup between Trump and Biden, depending on how adults in the poll identified.\nJust looking at all adults surveyed, excluding people who said they wouldn't vote, 46 percent supported Trump while 44 percent supported Biden. However, Biden led Trump among registered and likely voters. A total of 46 percent of registered voters supported Biden while 45 percent supported Trump. Meanwhile, 49 percent of likely voters supported Biden while 45 percent supported Trump.\nWhile it is still unclear how much damage a felony conviction in any of the four criminal indictments can have on Trump's campaign, a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted from February 9 to 12 found that 55 percent of American adults would not vote for Trump if he was convicted of a felony. That number is 51 percent among Republicans.\nThe full sample size of that poll was 1,237 people, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.91. The sample size of Republicans was 502, with a margin of error of plus or minus 5.26 percentage points.\n",

    "content": "Russia's tally of personnel and equipment losses is closing in on four significant markers, showing the extent of the cost of Moscow's full invasion of Ukraine on its own forces, according to Kyiv's latest figures.\nUkraine's defense ministry said on Saturday that over the previous day, Russia had lost 12 tanks, which takes the total over the course of the war to 7,366, only 134 shy of 7,500. Ukraine also said it had taken out 31 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) putting the total number of destroyed drones at 9,611, only 389 short of the 10,000 mark.\nMeanwhile, Moscow's forces also lost another 27 armored fighting vehicles on Friday for a total of 14,156—less than 900 away from the 15,000 mark.\nBut Russian troop losses continue to mount up, with Kyiv's estimate of 1,260 casualties for Friday being the seventh consecutive day this figure had topped 1,000. That includes both those who are killed and injured and Kyiv says its estimate of both personnel and equipment losses are \"very approximate, and do not claim to be particularly accurate.\"\nNewsweek has contacted the Russian defense ministry for comment.\nGetting an accurate figure of Russian troop losses is difficult but French Foreign Minister Stéphane Séjourne said in an interview released on Friday that Paris estimates Russian casualties were 500,000, 150,000 of whom had been killed.\n\"What is all this for?\" he told independent Russian outlet, Novaya Gazeta Europa. \"In short, there is no need.\"\nRussia has not updated its tally of losses since September 2022 when Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said was just under 6,000.\nKyiv is often tight-lipped about its losses, although in a rare admission, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in February that 31,000 of his troops had been killed.\nHowever, Shoigu said on Friday that Ukraine's troop losses had surpassed 111,000, as he claimed that Russian forces \"continue breaking the enemy's system of strongholds along the entire line of contact.\"\nRussia's Defense Ministry said it has recently captured settlements around the town of Avdiivka, in the Donetsk oblast, which was seized in February.\nShoigu announced the capture of 211 square miles of territory so far this year. This was higher than the figure of 155 square miles he had announced in April.\nThe Institute for the Study of War estimates Russia controls around one fifth of Ukrainian territory, or more than 38,000 square miles.\nThe think tank has predicted that Russia will conduct a major offensive in the coming weeks as it seeks to capitalize on Ukraine's lack of ammunition as it eagerly awaits the delivery of U.S. military aid following a $61 billion package passed by U.S. Congress\n",

    "content": "Thick murky clouds fill the sky, with freezing winds carrying snow faster than 100 miles per hour. With a frigid –30 degrees Fahrenheit temperature, life-threatening snowstorms and avalanches are frequent.\nAnd these are typical conditions on the world’s highest mountain: Mount Everest.\nThe behemoth towers 29,032 feet (8,849 meters) between Nepal and Tibet in the Himalayas, with its peak surpassing most clouds in the sky.\nAn attempt to climb Everest requires months, sometimes years, of training and conditioning – even then, reaching the summit is far from guaranteed. In fact, more than 300 people are known to have died on the mountain.\nAnd yet the mountain still draws hundreds of climbers who are determined to reach its peak every spring. Here’s what it takes to make the climb and what has motivated some climbers to summit the world’s highest peak.\nDr. Jacob Weasel, a trauma surgeon, successfully summited Everest last May after conditioning for nearly a year.\n“I would put on a 50-pound backpack and do two hours on a stair stepper with no problem,” Weasel told CNN. “So, I thought that I was in pretty good shape.” However, the surgeon said he was humbled after discovering that his fitness was no match for the lofty athleticism required by the mountain.\n“I would take five steps and have to take 30 seconds to a minute to catch my breath,” Weasel recalled of his struggle with the lack of oxygen available while ascending Everest.\nClimbers aiming for the summit usually practice an acclimatizing rotation to adjust their lungs to the thinning oxygen levels once they arrive on the mountain. This process involves mountaineers traveling upward to one of the four designated camps on Everest and spending one to four days there before traveling back down.\nRelated article\nIf you’re dreaming of climbing Mount Everest, this is what it takes\nThis routine is repeated at least two times to allow the body to adapt to declining oxygen levels. It increases a climber’s chances of survival and summiting.\n“If you took somebody and just plopped them up at the high camp on Everest, not even on the (top), they would probably go into a coma within 10 to 15 minutes,” Weasel said.\n“And they would be dead within an hour because their body is not adjusted to that low of oxygen levels.”\nWhile Weasel has successfully summited dozens of mountains, including Kilimanjaro (19,341 ft), Chimborazo (20, 549 ft), Cotopaxi (19,347 ft), and most recently Aconcagua (22,837 ft) in January, he said none of them compares to the high-altitude of Mount Everest.\n“Because no matter how well you are trained, once you get to the limits of what the human body can take, it’s just difficult,” he continued.\nAt its highest altitude, Everest is nearly incapable of sustaining human life and most mountaineers use supplementary oxygen above 23,000 feet. The lack of oxygen poses one of greatest threats to climbers who attempt to summit, with levels dropping to less than 40% when they reach the Everest “death zone.”\nThe first target for mountaineers is Everest base camp at approximately 17,000 feet, which takes climbers about two weeks. Then they ascend to the three remaining camps stationed along the mountain.\nCamp four, the final one before the summit, sits along the edge of the death zone at 26,000 feet, exposing climbers to an extremely thin layer of air, subzero temperatures, and high winds powerful enough to blow a person off the mountain.\nRelated article\nSherpa who saved climber in Everest death zone says it was hardest rescue ‘in my life’\n“It’s difficult to survive up there,” Weasel told CNN. He recalls passing bodies of climbers who died on the mountain – which isn’t uncommon. The bodies of the fallen mountaineers are well-preserved, exhibiting little to no decay due to the intense cold temperatures.\n“I am probably more familiar with death and the loss of life than most people,” the surgeon said. “For me it was just a reminder of the gravity of the situation and the fragility of what life is… even more so motivation for appreciating the opportunity.”\nHigh-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) is one of the most common illnesses climbers face while attempting to summit. “Your brain is starved of oxygen,” Weasel said.\nHACE results in the brain swelling during its attempt to regain stable oxygen levels, causing drowsiness, trouble speaking and thinking. This confusion is often accompanied by blurred vision and sporadic episodes of delusion.\n“I had auditory hallucinations where I was hearing voices [of friends] that I thought were coming from behind me,” Weasel recalled. “And I had visual hallucinations,” he added. “I was seeing the faces of my children and my wife coming out of the rocks.”\nWeasel recalled crossing paths with a friend, Orianne Aymard, who was trapped on the mountain due to an injury. “I remember staring at her for like five minutes and just saying, ‘I’m so sorry,’” Weasel said.\n“I’ve spent over a decade of my life training to help people as a surgeon, and being in a position where there’s somebody who requires your help and you are unable to offer any assistance… that feeling of helplessness was tough to deal with,” Weasel told CNN.\nAymard survived. She was rescued and suffered from several broken bones in her foot, in addition to severe frostbite on her hands. Despite all her injuries, Aymard is considered one of the lucky ones.\nEverest has long been a tomb for climbers who have succumbed to harsh conditions or accidents on its slopes.\nWhen a loved one or fellow climber is severely injured or dies on the mountain, it’s routine to leave them behind if you’re unable to save them, according to Alan Arnette, a mountaineer coach who summited Everest in 2014.\n“What most teams do out of respect for that climber, they will move the body out of sight,” he said. And that’s only if they can.\n“Sometimes that’s just not practical because of the bad weather, or because their bodies will get frozen into the mountain,” Arnette told CNN. “So, it’s very difficult to move them.”\nRelated article\nMount Everest: Nepal to remove trash and dead bodies from world’s tallest mountain\nSeeing a corpse on Everest is comparable to seeing a horrible car accident, according to the mountain coach. “You don’t turn around and go home,” Arnette said. “You respectfully slow down… or say a prayer for that person, and then you continue.”\nIt’s been 10 years since the single deadliest accident on the world’s highest mountain, after an avalanche killed 12 Sherpa guides. And 2023 was recorded as the deadliest year on Everest, with 18 fatalities on the mountain – including five people that are still unaccounted for.\nThe process of recovering bodies is extensive, sometimes impossible. Helicopter rescues and search missions are challenging due to the high altitude and frequently treacherous conditions, resulting in some rescuers dying in their attempt to save others.\nThe 3,000 feet climb from camp four to the summit can take anywhere from 14 to 18 hours. Therefore, mountaineers typically leave the camp at night.\n“That entire night was cold,” Weasel recalled. “It’s dark, it’s windy.” But it was proven to be worth it in the morning, he said.\n“Watching the sunrise from 29,000 feet and having that pyramid of Everest’s shadow projected onto the valley below you…,” Weasel told CNN. “It was probably one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen in my life,” he continued.\n“It’s weird standing up there and knowing that everything else on the planet is below where you’re standing.”\nThe size of the mountain is humbling, the surgeon said. “I’ve never felt so small,” he recalled. “That mixture of humility and connectedness with something bigger than yourself is the proper place from which we ought to approach our existence on this planet.”\nLike Weasel, Arnette summited at sunrise, and experienced this same feeling of “smallness.” At the top there were “more mountains than you can count,” Arnette remembered. “It was a sense of enormous gratitude and at the same time I knew I had to get back down.”\nAfter about 20 minutes to an hour, climbers typically start to descend back to the base of the mountain.\nBefore leaving for Nepal, Weasel was gifted an eagle’s feather as a beacon for his Native American heritage.\nHe was determined to plant the feather on top of Everest “as a symbol of our people and what we’ve endured for the past several hundred years,” Weasel told CNN. “Showing that our spirit is not broken, but we’re able to rise above the things that have happened to us,” he added.\n“I remember planting that eagle’s feather on the top of the world and the feeling of real privilege that I felt in representing our people.” And this is why he decided to summit Everest, to be an example that anything is possible for young Native children and his tribe.\n“Knowing what it’s like up there, for me personally, the only real justification for going and putting your life, and other lives, at risk is if you’re climbing for a reason that is much bigger than you,” said Weasel.\nArnette attempted to climb Everest three times before he successfully summited.\nRelated article\nNepal to require all Mount Everest climbers to use a tracking chip\n“My first three tries, I wasn’t clear on my why,” Arnette said. When his mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, he looked at his purpose for climbing differently.\n“I wanted to do it to raise money for Alzheimer’s and honor my mother,” Arnette said.\nThere are approximately 300 people that have been issued a permit from the Nepal government to climb the mountain this year, according to Arnette. And he said the number is down from previous years.\n“I think one of the reasons is because we had the 18 deaths last year, and people realize that Mount Everest is a dangerous mountain.”\nHowever, he doesn’t believe that should deter climbers from attempting to summit. “I’m a big believer that when you go climb these mountains that you come home a better version of yourself,” Arnette told CNN.\n“Everest has become too commercialized with ‘you’re stepping over dead bodies’ and ‘it’s littered with trash,’” the mountain coach said. “The reality is that it is a very small degree all of that, but there’s a lot of joy that people get out of doing it,” he continued.\n“And that’s the reason that we climb mountains.”\n",

    "content": "Editor’s Note: Mark Hannah is a senior fellow at the nonprofit Institute for Global Affairs at the Eurasia Group and host of its “None Of The Above” podcast. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.\nThe $95 billion military aid package President Joe Biden signed Wednesday was a feat of tough-minded negotiation to get funding to Ukraine and Israel after months of congressional horse-trading. But if the aid inflates those countries’ war aims, it could discourage the kind of tough-minded negotiation that is the only way to end their wars.\nBiden is right to help democratic countries confront their illiberal enemies. Israel and Ukraine suffered terrible crimes of aggression. But lofty expressions of unconditional support can paradoxically hurt the countries they are meant to help by hindering the kind of negotiated peace that saves civilian lives and restores stability.\nThe funds might motivate Ukraine and Israel to pursue unwinnable victories: the full restoration of Ukraine’s borders and reclamation of Crimea, and the destruction of Hamas, respectively. In international politics and armed conflict, fraught as they are with mutual distrust and competing views of fairness, sometimes countries can’t achieve justice — they can only achieve peace.\nThe new infusion of aid gives the US a lot of leverage with Ukraine and Israel. Washington has largely refused to exercise its leverage thus far, but it must do so now or peace in the near future doesn’t stand a chance.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to maintain that “total victory” over Hamas is the only outcome he will accept. But as the war grinds on, Israel reports having killed fewer than half of Hamas’ fighters while its tunnel network hasn’t been completely dismantled, indicating the group can likely sustain an insurgency against Israel for the foreseeable future. And even if it were possible to destroy Hamas, that outcome could prove to be a catastrophic success when images of the accompanying civilian devastation fuel ever more radicalization among Palestinians and stirs angry Arab publics who pressure their leaders to scuttle Arab-Israeli normalization efforts.\nSimilarly, the Ukrainian government insists it will continue fighting until it regains all of the territory it has lost, including Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014, and there is no sign the US administration is pushing it to reconsider. But as Gen. Mark Milley, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told me a year ago, “neither side is likely to achieve their complete political objectives through military means” so “it will probably end somewhere, somehow at a negotiating table.” And that was before Ukraine lost some of its best troops and equipment in last summer’s highly anticipated offensive, which failed to strike a knockout blow to Russia.\nRelated article\nOpinion: What John Fetterman and Mike Johnson have in common\nTo its credit, the administration seems clear-eyed enough to privately acknowledge Ukraine’s chances for retaking additional territory are slim. But there is still no public indication the US is trying to lay the groundwork for a negotiated settlement. Signaling American resolve can preserve Ukraine’s bargaining position, but it risks convincing Ukraine to reject a reasonable peace deal — if one is eventually offered — and continue fighting in pursuit of morally righteous but unattainable goals.\nLikewise, while the administration has ramped up humanitarian aid to Gaza, encouraged negotiations to get Hamas to release Israeli hostages and called for the Palestinian Authority to administer Gaza, it could do more to convince Israel to fundamentally rethink its destabilizing goals. The Biden administration should publicly and privately convey to Israel’s leaders that their current strategy is unlikely to succeed and undermines regional security.\nThere will be at least a few objections to orienting American policy toward the best possible outcomes in these conflicts — achieving peace and stability in the near term — rather than the unrealistic goals of our partners.\nWar has a way of eliciting worldviews organized around simplistic binaries. After the terror attacks on September 11, 2001, then-President George W. Bush declared that every country had to decide: “Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.” When Biden spoke of the war in Ukraine, Americans were told we faced a choice between offering Kyiv unconditional support or “withdrawing” from the conflict and letting Putin “erase” Ukraine. But these kinds of Manichean views that divide the world into evil aggressors and righteous victims do not make impossible military victories any more achievable.\nRelated article\nOpinion: Congress must let Ukraine win, say Barbra Streisand, Sean Penn, Imagine Dragons, Timothy Snyder and other luminaries\nSome people will say that the US can’t simply tell Ukraine and Israel, both sovereign countries, what to do. Indeed, this has largely been Biden’s public position, evident in his mantra “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine” and in the State Department’s insistence that “the United States doesn’t dictate to Israel what it must do.”\nThese countries do have agency — but so does the United States. American involvement in assisting these nations’ war efforts gives it the right and responsibility to share the course of each conflict in ways that protect its interests. The US can respect Ukraine’s and Israel’s agency without subjugating its own.\nIn Ukraine, this doesn’t mean threatening the withdrawal of aid, which would weaken its battlefield and negotiating position. Instead, the US could have enforced the restrictions it had already made (on Abrams Tanks, F-16s, cluster munitions and long-range missiles) or it could now materially support diplomatic efforts as enthusiastically as military efforts. However, the recent aid package includes long-range missiles, or ATACMS, which suggests Ukraine is readying an offensive against Crimea. For a year and a half, Biden judiciously refused to send these to Ukraine, calling them a “red line” for Putin, who might use nuclear weapons were Crimea attacked.\nIn Israel, putting conditions on military aid is a better idea. The US did use leverage after an Israeli military strike killed aid workers from World Central Kitchen — with sources telling CNN that Biden warned Netanyahu that the US would reconsider how it’s supporting Israel’s war unless Israel allowed for more humanitarian aid in Gaza. After that, Israel acceded to the ultimatum and, per a reported demand by Biden, publicly announced the change that day. Unfortunately, there’s little evidence the president has kept up the pressure. When the aid package passed Congress, a pro-Israel lobbying group cheered that the security assistance came “with no added conditions.”\nOne historical example illustrates how the US might use its leverage with Netanyahu today. After Israel encircled the Egyptian military in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger flew to Tel Aviv and pressured Prime Minister Golda Meir to enact a ceasefire. Egypt’s attack was, like that of Hamas, an unprovoked and surprise act of aggression. Kissinger feared a victory by the Soviet-backed Arab states. But recently declassified documents show he also feared an all-out Israeli victory.\nSign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook\nKissinger wrote that “from an Israeli point of view, it is no disaster to have the whole Arab world radicalized and anti-American, because this guarantees our continued support. From an American point of view, it is a disaster.” Kissinger advised that the US needed “to be taken even more seriously” by Israel, and “our insistence on a more politically oriented policy cannot go unheeded.” This advice rings even truer today.\nFundamentally, negotiated settlements are often morally unsatisfying. Russia shouldn’t be allowed to invade a sovereign country and get away with it. Israel has the right to defend itself. But too narrow a focus on what’s morally just obscures an appreciation for what’s strategically possible. What’s possible, in both Ukraine and Gaza, is peace.\n",

    "content": "After pro-Palestinian protesters briefly disrupted the University of Michigan's graduation ceremony on Saturday, videos shared to social media show the moment the crowd erupted into cheers as the group of students was escorted to the back of the venue.\nAbout 75 people, many of whom held Palestinian flags and signs, protested on Saturday afternoon during the university's spring graduation ceremony at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor.\nThe protesters marched up the main aisle while chanting and carrying signs, including a banner that read: \"No universities left in Gaza.\" While photos captured during the ceremony show numerous students donning traditional Arabic keffiyeh with their graduation caps, at least one decorated his cap with the Israeli flag.\nAbove the stadium, planes flew competing messages, with one reading, \"Divest from Israel now! Free Palestine!\" while the other read: \"We stand with Israel. Jewish lives matter,\" the Associated Press reported.\nUniversity of Michigan spokesperson Colleen Mastony told Newsweek in an email on Saturday evening that no one was arrested and said the protest did not delay the nearly two-hour ceremony, which \"celebrated the achievements of 8,500 undergraduates and 6,622 graduate and PhD students before a crowd of 62,000 wellwishers.\"\n\"The mood was joyous and the ceremony unfolded successfully and was completed without interruption,\" Mastony said. \"Approximately 75 protesters staged a small demonstration at the beginning of the program, walking up the main aisle and chanting before public safety personnel escorted them to the rear of the stadium, where they remained through the conclusion of the event.\"\nMastony continued: \"Peaceful protests like this have taken place at U-M commencement ceremonies for decades. The university supports free speech and expression, and university leaders are pleased that today's commencement was such a proud and triumphant moment, worthy of the achievements of our extraordinary graduates.\"\nVideos shared to X, formerly Twitter, show the demonstration and the moment the crowd erupts into cheers as the group is escorted away. However, it was unclear at the time of publication whether the crowd was cheering in support or opposition.\nThe videos show protesters chanting phrases such as \"Disclose, divest, we will not stop, we will not rest,\" and \"Regents, regents, you can't hide! You are funding genocide.\" Israel has rejected the allegation that its actions in Gaza are genocidal.\nAnother video appears to show people chanting in response to the protesters, yelling \"Shut the f*** up.\"\nX user Aviva Klompas captioned the clip: \"The pro-terror mob is currently ruining graduation day at@UMich.\"\nAuthor Oil London shared a video of the demonstration and wrote: \"University of Michigan commencement ceremony RUINED after mob of anti-Israel activists stormed the ceremony waving Palestinian flags. 'Palestine will live forever.'\"\nAdam Y. Abusalah also shared a video of the protest on X, writing: \"Graduates at the University of Michigan demonstrate for Palestine at the commencement ceremony in Ann Arbor today. 'Disclose, divest, we will not stop, we will not rest.'\"\nU.S. Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro, a commencement speaker, paused several times during his remarks, before saying, \"Ladies and gentlemen, if you can please draw your attention back to the podium,\" the AP reported.\nMeanwhile, pro-Palestinian demonstrations have spread across campuses in the U.S. following the arrests of protesters who set up a \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment\" at Columbia University in New York City on April 18. Since then, encampment demonstrations began popping up at universities all over the country, and hundreds of protesters have been arrested. Participants have been demanding that universities divest from companies supporting Israel as well as a permanent ceasefire to end the Israel-Hamas war.\nIsrael responded militarily after Hamas, a Palestinian militant group, launched a surprise attack on October 7, 2023, on the country that killed roughly 1,200 people and saw over 200 more taken hostage into Gaza. In nearly seven months of fighting, the Palestinian death toll has surpassed 34,000, with more than 76,000 injured in the besieged territory, according to the AP, per the Gaza Health Ministry, which notes that at least two-thirds have been children and women.\nThe staggering number of Palestinian deaths has sparked widespread condemnation from across the globe. Meanwhile, some protests have turned disruptive and violent, prompting police intervention and causing top U.S. lawmakers to pass legislation. Last week, the House of Representatives approved the Antisemitism Awareness Act to address reports of rising antisemitism on college campuses amid allegations of Jewish students being targeted during campus protests.\n",

    "content": "Amelia Showalter was debating whether asking a stranger to join her on a ghost tour was a mad idea.\nShe was sitting in a crowded bar in Edinburgh’s Old Town, the last dregs of a glass of Scottish whisky in front of her.\nAlso in front of her: Lucas Demaria. An Argentinian DJ she’d just met. He was a fellow Edinburgh tourist and a self-confessed “big nerd.” And he was someone Amelia was “very much liking talking with”\nAmelia swallowed the last of her whisky, and in turn swallowed her reservations. She wanted to carry on her conversation with Lucas. And she was in a city she’d never visited before. If he said no, it didn’t matter. What did she have to lose?\n“I’m heading on this ghost tour soon,” Amelia said. “Do you want to come? It’s supposed to be spooky.”\nLucas raised his eyebrow.\n“Not that I actually believe in ghosts,” Amelia added quickly.\n“Sure,” said Lucas, laughing. “Why not.”\nThe next thing they knew, Amelia and Lucas were walking, shoulder to shoulder, down Edinburgh’s cobbled streets. Dusk was falling and the city, with its stone spired buildings and hills and crags in the distance, had a dreamy atmosphere.\nThe ghost tour focused on the city’s bloody history, with the guide recounting the chilling tale of grave robbers Burke and Hare, stories of plague and taking the group into Edinburgh’s eerie Blair Street underground vaults, a series of abandoned chambers beneath the city’s South Bridge.\n“You’d think it wouldn’t be very romantic,” Amelia tells CNN Travel today. “But it was, because you’re kind of pretending to be scared.”\nAmelia and Lucas stood closer and closer as the tour progressed. Their hands brushed against each other, but didn’t quite touch.\nAnd then, tour over, the two ducked into a bar. They sat together, drinking and chatting into the night.\n“And at some point I was like, ‘We should make out,’” says Amelia.\n“And I was like, ‘Yes,’” says Lucas, laughing.\n“I feel like at that point we were both like, ‘Come on, we’re going to kiss,’” says Amelia.\n“It was going that way for sure,” says Lucas.\nAmelia and Lucas went on the spontaneous ghost tour on June 4, 2018, which just so happened to be Amelia’s 35th birthday.\nBack then, Amelia lived and worked in Washington D.C., running a political data consultancy. She’d previously worked on President Barack Obama’s campaign in 2012.\nFrom time to time, Amelia’s work led to interesting travel opportunities – and that’s how she ended up visiting the UK in June 2018. She got invited to speak at a conference in London, and decided to tack on some extra days exploring the UK.\n“I was like, ‘Well, if I’m going to be sort of traveling on my own, when I turn 35, I should do something fun – I should go celebrate somehow,’” says Amelia.\nAmelia decided to attend a “Game of Thrones” convention in Manchester in the north of England (“I love sci-fi, fantasy, all that stuff,” she says). Then she headed up to Scotland to squeeze in a day of solo travel in Edinburgh.\n“I just had the one day there,” recalls Amelia. “So I went to the National Museum of Scotland. I ate some haggis. And then I wanted to have some Scotch.”\nAmelia figured it would be fitting to sample a 35-year-old Scottish whisky on the day of her 35th birthday. She Googled Edinburgh’s best whisky bars and the internet suggested Edinburgh institution Bow Bar, situated on the city’s colorful, winding Victoria Street. Amelia headed in that direction, pushed open the blue door and grabbed a seat at the bar.\nShe’d just started sipping her drink when she spotted Lucas. He caught her eye because he was – unlike almost everyone else inside Bow Bar– drinking a beer.\n“I just thought it was so strange that this person was drinking a beer in a whisky bar,” says Amelia. “I really wanted to know, ‘What beer is so good that you’re doing that instead of drinking some whisky?’”\nWithout really thinking twice, Amelia turned to the stranger and asked the question.\nIn June 2018, Lucas Demaria was 36 and starting to “give up on trying to find the one,” as he puts it.\nDisillusioned with romance, Lucas decided to focus on exploring the world.\n“I started traveling late in my life,” Lucas tells CNN Travel. “And it just blew my mind.”\nHe arrived in Edinburgh for the first time on the morning of June 4, 2018. He’d heard the city was scenic, but he couldn’t quite believe how spectacular it really was.\n“I made it there and was like, ‘Oh my God, this is a beautiful city,’” recalls Lucas. “I had in my mind eating haggis, so I dropped the bag in the hostel, started walking, ate haggis, and then I told myself, ‘Okay, I need to drink some scotch’ But I’m very into beer. And I know really nothing about scotch.”\nLucas stumbled across the Bow Bar while wandering around on foot. It looked like the place to go to satisfy his whisky quest. But once inside, the range of options was pretty intimidating. Lucas stared at the bottles, mystified. In the end he ordered a beer to enjoy while he mulled over the whisky options.\nWhen Amelia struck up conversation, questioning his drink choice, Lucas told her a truncated version of this explanation. He’d actually been debating how to strike up conversation with Amelia before she got in there first – he’d noticed her almost right away: “Sitting at the end of the bar, a beautiful lady,” as he recalls it.\nDrink orders explained, the conversation moved on. Lucas was wearing a “Star Wars” T-shirt, and Amelia commented on it, saying she was also a fan.\n“I showed her my ‘Star Wars’ tattoos,” says Lucas.\nAt the time, Amelia was into cosplay – recreating and wearing the costumes of fictional characters. So after she’d admired the tattoos, she got out her phone, and showed Lucas some photos of her hand-sewn “Star Wars” costumes.\n“It was a nerd meeting,” says Lucas, laughing.\nFrom there, the two talked a bit about their impressions of the UK, realizing along the way that they shared the same favorite British band: The Beatles.\nThe conversation flowed in a way that surprised them both – neither Lucas or Amelia usually spoke to strangers in bars.\n“It’s not in my nature,” says Lucas. “But I would do that while traveling.”\n“Yeah, I would never just go start talking to a random person in a bar in D.C., which is where I lived at the time,” agrees Amelia. “But when I travel, I’m just a much more open-minded person.”\nIt was this outlook that prompted Amelia to invite Lucas to join her on the ghost tour – and prompted Lucas to say yes.\nAfter the evening of whisky drinking, ghost stories and growing closer, Amelia and Lucas had to say their goodbyes. Amelia was heading down to London for her conference, while Lucas still had a few more days exploring Edinburgh. The two exchanged contact details, and started communicating via messaging app WhatsApp.\n“First it was just text, for a couple of weeks, with some photos,” recalls Amelia.\nAnd then, one day when she was back home in Washington D.C., Amelia saw a voice recording from Lucas pop up on her phone.\nVoice notes are pretty commonplace in the US now, but in 2018, Amelia had never come across the concept. In contrast, Lucas regularly sent voice notes to his friends in Argentina.\nAmelia clicked play, and Lucas’ voice echoed around her bedroom. Her heart started racing.\n“To hear his voice and everything, I was just so excited,” she recalls. “And it made me realize, ‘Oh, I really like this guy.’ Because when I was hearing his voice again, it was just so wonderful.”\nBefore long, Amelia and Lucas were video calling regularly.\n“We’d be talking for an hour, a couple of hours,” recalls Amelia.\n“Several times a week,” says Lucas.\nRelated article\nThey fell in love on vacation but went their separate ways. Four years later, she sent him an email: ‘Remember me?’\nAmelia’s a data scientist by trade, and even while caught up in the heady emotions of falling for Lucas, she tried to think things through logically.\n“When we met, I started making a little spreadsheet of how certain I felt that he was the love of my life,” recalls Amelia.\n“I wasn’t being overly romantic – the first entry was 10% – a 10% chance Lucas was the love of my life. Which is actually really high if you think about it, just because what are the odds that any person is the love of your life?”\nAs she spent more and more time WhatsApping Lucas, Amelia added more data to the spreadsheet.\n“It went up to 20%,” she says. “I kept plotting it out.”\nBut Amelia knew the only way of securing a higher score would be to see Lucas again. The prospect had been raised on their video calls – but they had to figure out the logistics.\nLucas’ DJ job was always busier during his Argentinian summer months, starting November through to January. If he was going to embark on another vacation, it needed to be before then.\nAmelia considered visiting Lucas, and Lucas debated visiting Amelia, but ultimately the two decided meeting in a third country was the best plan.\n“So in October of 2018, we scheduled a 10-day trip to Peru together,” recalls Amelia. “Our second date.”\nOn their respective flights to Peru, Amelia and Lucas played back their months of video conversations in their head. They were both excited, but also apprehensive.\n“I think my biggest fear, going to Peru, was, ‘What if I get there, and all of a sudden, it just feels wrong? Like I’ve built this whole thing up in my head,’” recalls Amelia. “Because you can kind of do that with long distance.”\nBut as soon as Amelia saw Lucas, her fears dissolved.\n“Immediately, I was like, ‘Oh, no, this is great,’” Amelia says. “Within the first two days, when we were walking around Lima, it was like, ‘This feels really serious.’ And it felt good.”\nIn between hiking the Inca Trail, marveling at Machu Picchu and eating mountains of delicious Peruvian food, Amelia and Lucas started talking about marriage.\n“By the end of the trip, we were not exactly engaged. But we were sort of engaged to be engaged,” says Amelia.\nShe updated her spreadsheet: the percentage was steadily climbing.\nThe idea of marrying someone you’d only met twice seemed bizarre, but both Amelia and Lucas felt calm and excited when they considered their future together – with just a dash of surprise at the whole thing. After all, their lives were taking a direction neither of them had anticipated – it was a happy shift, but a shift all the same.\n“I never thought about getting married either until I met her, basically,” says Lucas.\nAmelia echoes this.\n“I had really gotten fine with the idea of being single,” she says. “I was like, ‘Well, maybe I’m just going to be one of those people that doesn’t meet anybody. And that’s okay. I’m just going to have a life on my own.’”\nThe future suddenly looked very different for both of them.\nIn February 2019, Lucas came to D.C. to visit Amelia. He met her parents, friends and loved ones. Not long after, Amelia visited Lucas in Argentina.\nIt was during that trip that the couple officially got engaged. They picked out the ring together, making official something both of them knew was on the cards from pretty much day one.\nExplaining this feeling to loved ones was sometimes a little “strange,” says Amelia. She recalls saying: “I met this guy in Scotland, but he’s from Argentina. And I think we might get married” and fielding disbelieving responses, and some concerns.\n“It was just definitely a strange thing to explain to people,” Amelia reflects today. “But I think also, it’s such a different thing when you’re in your 30s – because you know yourself better. I think it would be ill advised to do that when you’re 20, because you don’t really know yourself and it’s easy to get kind of caught up. But I think after 15, 20 years of dating, you know yourself – and you have had enough other relationships to know what doesn’t work.”\nRelated article\nShe swore she’d never get married. Then, she traveled to London and a surprise meeting changed her mind\nAmelia and Lucas were married at a small courthouse ceremony in Washington D.C. in the summer of 2019. Then, four months later, the couple threw a big D.C. celebration for family and friends.\nAs a DJ, Lucas had worked hundreds of weddings. He’d seen stuff he liked, stuff he didn’t like – and all in all, knew what added up to a great evening. Amelia was on the same page. The couple wanted the evening to feel like, “a night at the bar with all your friends,” as Amelia puts it.\nAmelia and Lucas rented a cafe-bar called Emissary in D.C. for the evening.\n“We had endless appetizers,” recalls Amelia. “So there wasn’t a sit down dinner. It was just food whenever you want, open bar, with all the usual stuff that’s on the menu, and espresso when you want because it was also a cafe.”\nLucas mixed the music in advance, while Amelia made her own wedding dress using the sewing skills she’d perfected from her years of cosplay.\nAnd when she was planning her speech and considering what to say, Amelia dug out the spreadsheets she’d compiled when she first met Lucas.\n“I printed signs with the graphs I made,” she says. “Everyone thought it was very funny.”\nMeanwhile Lucas’ best friend from Argentina made a speech in which he recounted the moment Lucas first told him he’d met Amelia – and how he’d known she was someone special based on the excited, heartfelt tone of Lucas’ voice.\nThe wedding also nodded to Amelia and Lucas’ first conversation in Bow Bar about their shared love of “Star Wars.” Midway through their first dance – to The Beatles’ “In My Life” – the couple interrupted proceedings to have a mini lightsaber battle.\n“Secretly, we had hidden some lightsabers with a couple of our friends,” explains Amelia, laughing. “So halfway through the dance. We did a little lightsaber action, little tiny dance fight, and then back to dancing.”\n“You wouldn’t think that lightsabers would work with the Beatles in my life. When I say it out loud, it sounds like a really weird combination, but it was really fun.”\nA month or so later, Lucas and Amelia relocated from D.C. to Seattle, Washington, where Amelia had grown up and where her parents still lived.\nShe was ready to leave the US capital, and figured if she and Lucas might have a kid, it’d be nice to be closer to family.\nAs for Lucas, serendipitously, Seattle happened to be a perfect fit. He loved grunge music (“I was a kid in the ‘90s,” he shrugs), IPA beers and black coffee. He was instantly “so happy” there.\nRelated article\nTwo strangers met in Berlin. Here’s how they ended up having ‘three weddings’\nCut to today and Lucas and Amelia still live in Seattle. Lucas set up his own successful Seattle-based DJ business, while Amelia’s still working in political data analysis. The couple are also kept busy by their three-year-old son Jude.\nHe’s named – of course – for The Beatles song, “Hey Jude.” The name seemed appropriate, given Lucas and Amelia both love The Beatles and talked about the band that first night in Edinburgh.\n“It’s so funny because those things – the fact that we both love ‘Star Wars’ and The Beatles – it mattered a lot at the beginning because it was like, ‘Oh, we have these things in common,’” reflects Amelia. “And now I don’t think about them so much, because we just have a whole life together.”\n“I think shared values are, in the end, way more important than a shared taste for movies,” agrees Lucas.\nIt’s their similar  approach to life, Lucas suggests, that’s led him and Amelia to the happiness they continue to enjoy today.\nPlus, while they still enjoy watching the same TV and movies, Amelia and Lucas’ tastes do occasionally diverge. Amelia loves a Broadway musical, for example, which isn’t Lucas’ vibe. Meanwhile Amelia’s never quite got her head around Lucas’ passion for heavy metal.\nThe pandemic, and then the birth of Jude, put a pause on Lucas and Amelia’s desire to travel the world together post-wedding. But in 2023, the couple embarked on a long-awaited “amazing” Honeymoon to Japan, leaving Jude in the care of his grandparents.\nAlso on the travel agenda is one day returning to Edinburgh, this time with Jude in tow. Amelia and Lucas want to show their son where they met, and retrace the steps of their first evening together.\n“We’re going to take Jude to the bar,” says Lucas.\n“Put him on the bar,” adds Amelia, laughing. “And say, ‘This is your fault.’”\n“Free drinks for us,” jokes Lucas.\nIn reality, they’ll probably hold off on returning to Edinburgh until Jude’s old enough to enjoy the trip in his own right.\n“Maybe on our 10 year anniversary, or something,” says Amelia. “There’s so much of Scotland I’ve never seen, so we definitely want to go back there someday.”\nSomething Lucas and Amelia still marvel at is the idea that they’re so compatible, despite the fact they grew up thousands of miles from each other – and only happened to be in the same bar, in the same city, in the same country by happenstance.\n“It’s so weird, he’s just a random guy in a bar,” says Amelia.\n“From a different country,” adds Lucas.\nNeither are who the other envisaged when they imagined a prospective life partner.\nLucas – who recalls breaking up with an ex who lived 15 minutes away from him because he felt like they were from “different worlds” – finds it incongruous yet incredible that he ended up marrying someone he met on vacation.\nAs for Amelia, she always figured she’d end up with a fellow Ivy League graduate, who also worked in the D.C. politics world.\n“It wasn’t like, ‘Oh I must be with that kind of person,’” she says. “But you just get an idea of, ‘This is probably who I will end up with.’ I never would have assumed it would be a DJ from Argentina.”\nAll this suggests, says Amelia and Lucas, that compatibility has little to do with shared backgrounds. It goes back to that shared values thing and being on the same wavelength, they say – and the idea of being open, of willingly embarking on adventures.\n“I mean, it doesn’t mean you’re going to absolutely find the love of your life from traveling,” says Lucas.\n“You could find the love of one night, and that can be fun too,” says Amelia.\nAmelia and Lucas are also grateful that their relationship continues to develop as they grow together.\n“We were in love,” says Lucas of their 2018 selves. “But we didn’t know each other 100% as we do know.”\n“I always felt certain about you,” says Amelia to Lucas. “But I’m more in love with you all the time. It’s wonderful.”\n",

    "content": "The summer before my first year of high school, I took daily two-mile runs down the country road I lived on in western Massachusetts. I was training for my third season on the varsity soccer team and enjoyed pushing my body, sprinting from one telephone pole to the next, then slowing to a jog, then sprinting again.\nBut one morning when I went for my run, something was different—I'd barely made it past the first telephone pole when my body begged me to stop. Running felt impossible and even walking was difficult, so I turned around, went home, and sank into the couch, where I stayed for much of the next year.\nAlthough I didn't know it then, I'd developed Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, or POTS, a mysterious and often misdiagnosed disease that's part chronic fatigue syndrome, part fibromyalgia, and part dysautonomia—dysfunction of the nervous system that causes changes to blood pressure, heartbeat, and other essential body processes.\nI've been POTS-free for 10 years now, but as the disease sees a resurgence in the wake of COVID-19 (studies show that almost 80 percent of Long Covid patients have POTS and POTS-like symptoms are common among those who experienced severe COVID-19), I'm reminded of my own experience with the condition, and hope it passes for other patients as it did for me.\nFatigue was the first symptom I noticed that summer, but soon there were others. My body became ultra-sensitive to pain—even a gentle hug from my parents felt like it was bruising my skin, and the prick of a needle to draw blood (something I was used to since I have cystic fibrosis, a genetic respiratory disease that requires regular blood tests) was suddenly excruciating.\nI experienced numbness and tingling all over my body, I could feel every heartbeat echo loudly in my chest, and my feet turned a frightening shade of purple when I sat with them on the floor rather than propped up on a cushion.\nThere seemed to be no obvious root cause of my symptoms, which had doctors stumped.\nMy primary care physician prescribed the ADHD medication Concerta for chronic fatigue, which kept me awake for 24 hours straight. A specialist tested me for Lupus, my cystic fibrosis doctors thought my disease worsening and encouraged me to increase my treatments. Acupuncturists and energy healers tried in vain to ease my symptoms, putting me through the intense pain of needles and massage.\nSome doctors, after seeing that my test results were normal, even suggested ibuprofen and told me to push through it.\nWithout answers, I began to wonder if I was making it all up.\nPerhaps even worse than the physical symptoms of POTS was the condition's emotional effect. At 14, all I wanted was to spend time with my friends, play on the soccer team, join classes and extracurricular activities. But with the fatigue, pain, and brain fog I was experiencing, participating in my former life felt impossible.\nLooking back as a healthy 20-something, I can still vividly remember the questions that broke against the shore of my mind over and over during that time: Why is this happening to me? Will I ever finish high school? What if I feel like this for the rest of my life?\nSome days were worse than others. I remember my mother's hushed voice as she called the school administrator: \"She won't be coming in today. We'll try again tomorrow.\"\nOn the days I did go to school, I had little in common with my friends, who had been supportive at the beginning but soon moved on with their own lives, tired of asking me how I was feeling.\nUnlike them, I didn't have the luxury of forgetting I was sick.\nIf sheer willpower could have gotten me past my symptoms, it would have—I'd never wanted to go to school or get out of bed so badly. But my body couldn't keep up with what my mind wanted from it, and that was the source of a whole lot of distress.\nLuckily, my parents were determined to get to the bottom of my mysterious health issues, and eventually found a diagnostician well-versed in rare diseases. After just a few minutes, the diagnostician finally had an answer: POTS.\nHe claimed that when he shook my hand at the beginning of the appointment it was cold, then when he examined me a few minutes later it was warm—a telltale sign of dysautonomia.\nA table test (in which my blood pressure was taken while I was sitting, lying down, and then standing) confirmed the diagnosis.\nThe battle with POTS was just beginning, but finally I was armed with a word for my suffering, a condition I could blame for my fast-paced teenage life grinding so suddenly to a halt.\nReading stories of people suffering from Long Covid and POTS, I'm instantly brought back to that phase in my life. I remember feeling like a stranger in my own body, constantly fighting against it to get through each day.\nDoctors, friends, and healthy people didn't understand—the symptoms were overpowering, and the fear that they would always be there only added to the exhaustion.\nGetting a diagnosis lit a fire under me, even though there was no cure for POTS and little treatment for the condition doctors still didn't seem to understand. By the time I saw a dysautonomia specialist, I had already missed most of ninth grade, and was desperately worried about what that meant for my future.\nI wish I could say I was given some magical cure, a pill I popped once that made the symptoms subside, or an exorcism that took the dysautonomia from my body. Instead, I was recommended an exercise regimen and prescribed medication that helped my body pump blood and manage water retention.\nMy muscles had atrophied after months of disuse, and that plus the fatigue made exercising difficult. But I did the best I could, determined to get back to \"normal\" life, no matter what it took.\nBy the start of my sophomore year of high school (my teachers mercifully passed me onto the next grade despite my spotty attendance), I could at least go to a few classes a day, although my once steady attention span had dissolved into intense brain fog that made it difficult to recall simple words.\nDesperate to get away from my reputation as a sick girl and the couch where I'd spent most of my hours for the past year, I applied for a study abroad program in Italy and was accepted.\nAlthough I can't say for sure, I believe that the six months I went on to spend in Italy cured me of POTS.\nI can make no medical claims (nor did my doctors have any insight), but my suspicion is that the slower pace of life, cleaner diet, and generally more joyful lifestyle in Italy worked wonders for my health.\nSix days a week I'd ride my bike along the beach in Rimini from my host family's apartment to my high school, even though the motion of pedaling made my muscles scream.\nI'd follow along in class as best I could from 8am until 1pm, then bike home again for a three-course meal, complete with a glass of wine and a cup of espresso.\nAfter lunch, the whole house would nap—unlike in the U.S., where my packed schedule had stretched from 8am until 8pm without much free time, in Italy rest was part of each day.\nOn the weekends, I'd meet up with my friends to walk around the center of the city and chat, and despite more of a spiritual than religious upbringing, I went to church every week so I could hang out with my friends, who were all Catholic.\nI remember clutching the back of the church pew each time we had to stand during Mass, begging my body to stay standing for just a second longer, just a second longer... But the recognition of and surrender to a power greater than myself helped me release some of the mental burden of my experience with POTS.\nA few weeks after I returned home from Italy (just about two years after my symptoms had started) I woke up one morning healthy again.\nThere was no warning, no sign that this would be the day, just a sudden surge of energy I'd forgotten I was capable of. Joy seeped through every cell in my body—I finally felt like I could live my life rather than survive it.\nI took a run that morning for the first time in two years, tears streaming down my cheeks as I made it past one telephone pole and then another.\nI'm not a doctor nor a healer—I don't have the answers. Maybe it was a coincidence that my health returned after six months in Italy, or maybe it really was that active and pleasure-focused lifestyle that put my body back on the right track.\nAll I have to offer those who are suffering from Long Covid or POTS is a tiny sliver of hope: For me, POTS went away and has not come back. I wish that sweet relief on every single person suffering from these debilitating disorders.\nZanny Merullo Steffgen is a chronically ill freelance writer based in Colorado.

    "content": "Nobody has anything nice to say about Michael Cohen.\nDonald Trump’s former fixer and lawyer is expected to take the stand Monday as the key witness in the Manhattan district attorney’s case against the former president, prepared to give testimony connecting to Trump the $130,000 hush money payment Cohen made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election.\nThrough three weeks of testimony, jurors have already heard plenty about Cohen through numerous witnesses, who have painted an unflattering portrait of an aggressive, impulsive and unlikeable attorney.\nDavid Pecker, former head of National Enquirer parent company American Media Inc., said Cohen was “prone to exaggeration.” Former Trump aide Hope Hicks said Cohen liked to call himself a “fixer” – a role she said was possible only because “he first broke it.” And Daniels’ former attorney Keith Davidson said he only worked with Cohen because he was a “jerk” whom Daniels’ then-manager Gina Rodriguez – along with everyone else – didn’t want to deal with.\n\n“Gina called me up to tell me that: ‘Some jerk called me and was very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me. And I, um, would like you, Keith, to call this jerk back,’” Davidson testified in the third week of the trial.\n“I hate to ask it this way, but who was that jerk?” asked Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass.\n“It was Michael Cohen,” Davidson responded.\nNow Cohen is the witness whom prosecutors are relying on to deliver testimony that can help them prove Trump falsified business records when he allegedly reimbursed Cohen for the $130,000 to Daniels to keep her from going public about a past encounter ahead of the 2016 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied the affair.\nCohen is the only witness who will testify about Trump’s alleged involvement in both the decision to pay Daniels and the plan to reimburse Cohen for advancing the money. Cohen will likely serve as the narrator for the prosecution and take the jury from the initial meeting in which Pecker, Cohen and Trump allegedly agreed to buy negative stories that could hurt Trump’s presidential run to the payment made to Daniels just days before Election Day to an Oval Office meeting in February 2017, just weeks after Trump was sworn in.\nProsecutors allege that during the February meeting, Trump and Cohen agreed how Cohen would be paid back. That arrangement, prosecutors say, included a false story that Cohen was working under a retainer agreement. The paperwork, from the invoices and general ledger entries to the checks signed by Trump, make up the 34 criminal charges in the case.\nProsecutors have waited to call Cohen until the end of their case, after introducing phone records, emails, text messages and bank records that they hope bolster his credibility with the jury. They have not tried to hide from the jury that he and other witnesses have plenty of problems.\n“We are going to be very up-front about the fact that several of the witnesses in this case have what you made might consider to be some baggage,” Steinglass told a panel of prospective jurors during jury selection.\nThe testimony will pit Trump against Cohen, who once said he would take a bullet for the former president. They last saw each other when Cohen testified in Trump’s New York civil fraud trial last fall. Cohen’s testimony was brief, but the showdown was tense.\nThis week the stakes are higher, with a potential criminal conviction and possible jail sentence on the line for Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.\nIt brings to a close a long journey for Cohen, who is still aggrieved that he served three years in prison and home confinement after pleading guilty to federal campaign finance charges related to the payoff, among other crimes.\nCohen met with prosecutors more than a dozen times and testified before the grand jury in the hush money trial. He has immunity on state charges for his role in the alleged conspiracy.\nHe will also face blistering cross-examination by Trump attorney Todd Blanche. The former president’s lawyers are expected to hammer at Cohen’s credibility, including digging into his past, and suggest to the jury that Trump had no idea what deal Cohen struck or how it was recorded on the books of his company.\n“Even before he takes the stand, Cohen has been attacked and undermined by the prosecution’s own witnesses. On one hand, he could be damaged goods before he takes the stand. But he also might benefit from low expectations if the jury finds him to be better than advertised,” said Elie Honig, a CNN senior legal analyst and former state and federal prosecutor.\nThe charges filed against Trump date to events that transpired during the 2016 election. But in many ways, the case against Trump stems from his former fixer’s decision to plead guilty in 2018 in federal court to two counts of making unlawful campaign contributions in violation of federal campaign finance laws. He implicated Trump directly in the scheme and admitted that he orchestrated to pay Daniels on Trump’s behalf.\nCohen also pleaded guilty to tax charges and to lying to Congress about Trump’s business venture to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison, which he served behind bars and under house arrest.\nCohen’s plea prompted the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office to launch the investigation surrounding the hush money payments that led to Trump’s indictment last year.\nCohen became dedicated to antagonizing Trump. He published two books, “Disloyal” in 2020 and “Revenge” in 2022, and launched a podcast, “Mea Culpa” – all of which spent plenty of time bashing Trump and cheering on his prosecution.\nOn social media, Cohen continued to attack Trump in the weeks leading up to the trial, and even after it began. The social media jabs reached the point that Judge Juan Merchan told prosecutors Friday to give Cohen a message “from the bench” that he should stop speaking about the case. (Merchan has said he cannot legally gag a witness.)\nTrump has often punched right back in interviews and on social media, including in several instances that violated the judge’s gag order on the former president barring discussion of witnesses in the case.\nBeginning with the first witness in the case, Pecker, jurors have heard criticisms from witness after witness of Cohen ahead of his own expected testimony.\nPecker, who met with Cohen and Trump at a key Trump Tower meeting in 2015, was asked by Trump attorney Emil Bove whether Cohen was “prone to exaggeration.”\n“Yes,” Pecker said.\nBove then asked Pecker whether he could not trust everything Cohen said. The judge sustained an objection to the question, telling Trump’s attorney in a sidebar discussion that it was not the right place to “impeach” Cohen’s credibility.\nMore witnesses would keep doing so anyway.\nCohen’s former banker, Gary Farro, then testified that he was specifically given Cohen’s account because he could be firm with individuals who “may be a little challenging.” Farro said it was fair to call Cohen an “aggressive guy.”\n“Anything he did need, he called me, and it was always something that was urgent,” the banker said.\nArguably the most negative assessment of Cohen came from Davidson, who negotiated the hush money deal with Cohen on Daniels’ behalf in 2016. Davidson described a 2011 conversation about a blog post on Daniels and Trump on thedirty.com, where Cohen unleashed a “barrage of insults and insinuations and allegations.”\n“I don’t think he was accusing us of anything. He was just screaming,” Davidson said.\nDaniels’ former attorney went on to explain how he ended up involved in the hush money deal, when Daniels’ manager asked him to help finalize the deal for a nondisclosure agreement.\nAsked why he got involved, Davidson said: “The moral of the story was: No one wanted to talk to Cohen.”\nDavidson recalled under questioning from Steinglass that after Trump was elected in 2016, he got a call in December from a “very despondent and saddened” Cohen.\n“He said something to the effect of: ‘Jesus Christ.

I’ve saved that guy’s a** so many times, you don’t even know.’”\nOthers who didn’t interact with Cohen as much as Davidson didn’t have much better things to say. Jeff McConney, the former Trump Organization controller, was asked what Cohen’s position was at the company.\n“He said he was a lawyer,” McConney responded.\n“Did he work in the legal department?” asked prosecutor Matthew Colangelo.\n“I guess so,” McConney said derisively.\nAnd Hicks, who worked at the Trump Organization before becoming a key aide on the 2016 campaign, described to jurors how Cohen – Trump’s fixer – was prone to inflate his influence on the campaign.\n“There were times where Mr. Cohen did things that you felt were not helpful to what you were trying to accomplish, right?” Bove asked Trump’s 2016 campaign press secretary.\n“Yes,” Hicks responded. “I used to say that he liked to call himself ‘a fixer’ or ‘Mr. Fix It,’ and it was only because he first broke it that he was able to come and fix it.”\n",

    "content": "It was the early 1980s and I'd been Habitat for Humanity's executive director for a year or so of this nascent New York City project. I was only around 25 at the time.\nWe laid claim to this building on East 6th Street but didn't have ownership. The Lower East Side was like the South Bronx at that time—pretty bombed out, with frequent fires destroying buildings. It started to become gentrified, but nothing like it is today.\nHabitat International in Georgia was not very well known back then, with only several dozen projects around the world, many of them in Africa and elsewhere in the Americas.\nBut former president Jimmy Carter, two years out of office, had become interested in Habitat.\nOne day, I happened to pick up the New York Daily News, which I never read. There was a small article saying Carter would be in New York to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the installation of the Greek Archbishop, a friend of Carter's, on April 1, 1984.\nI sent the clip to Millard Fuller, the founder of Habitat who had recently gotten Carter interested in the organization, thinking it'd be great if the former president could stop by our project while he was in New York, but never believing it would be possible.\nMillard woke me up at about 7:00 in the morning with a call. He said: \"Rob, I got news for you. Jimmy Carter's coming to your project.\"\nWell, that got me up. We made plans for Carter to come, and my instructions were to meet him on Sunday morning in the presidential suite of the Waldorf Astoria on Park Avenue.\nI had never met anyone of that stature before. I was so nervous waiting outside the suite that it felt like someone had stuck a vacuum cleaner hose into my mouth and sucked out all the moisture. Then he showed up.\nOne of the first things I noticed was how old he looked compared to when he left office. It happens to everybody; the only president who looked younger at the end of his time in the White House was Ronald Reagan.\nI said, \"Hello, Mr. President,\" thanked him for coming, and then I pulled out these cheesecakes from a famous deli in Brooklyn called Junior's.\nI said: \"Mr. President, if you don't come back to New York for any other reason, you have to come back for Junior's cheesecakes.\"\nI pulled out the first one and said: \"This one's for you and...Mrs. President.\" I didn't even know what to call her. And then I said: \"And this one's for Nancy Konigsmark.\"\nNancy had been married to Hamilton Jordan, a staffer in the White House, and she was Carter's appointment secretary. I had been dealing with her about the logistics of the meeting.\nThen I said: \"And this one's for these fellows for taking such good care of you,\" and pointed to the burly Secret Service agents accompanying him.\nCharacteristically, Carter was very gracious and said: \"Well, thank you, Rob. Thank you very much. That's very nice.\" But I could tell he thought: \"Am I in New York City? This is the hokiest thing I've ever experienced in my life.\"\nWe got in the car. He'd had a dispute with Ed Koch, the mayor of New York, over Israeli policy. On the way down, he said: \"What's the status of the purchase of the building from the city?\"\nI told him we were still working through that, and he said: \"I'll call the mayor and ask him to increase the price for you and then he'll give it to you.\" This showed he had a marvelous sense of humor. He wasn't known for that, but he had quite a dry wit.\nWe got down to the Lower East Side, East 6th Street near Avenue D. The Secret Service were going nuts because it was the 9th precinct which at the time had the highest homicide rate in the city, mostly because of drugs. The Lower East Side is nothing like it is now.\nToday, my wife and I attend a church in Manhattan and we run into 20 and 30-somethings who come from Kansas City and places like that. They say: \"I like New York, but I was hoping to live on the Lower East Side. I can't afford it. I'm gonna have to live on the Upper East Side.\"\nIn the 80s, when I lived on the Lower East Side, there were three different brands of heroin being sold on my block. It just shows how much New York has changed. (What hasn't changed is the shortage of affordable housing, more acute than ever).\nBefore we started work on the building, the junkies had taken the marble slabs out of the staircase. The day before Carter's arrival, we got volunteers to put together a temporary wooden staircase, but we still had to navigate our way up to the roof, which was full of holes.\nFrom the top, Carter looked downtown and saw the World Trade Center and Wall Street and all that it represented. Then he looked in the other direction, saw Midtown Manhattan and all the wealth and power that it represented.\nFinally, peering over the edge to the rubble-strewn backyard of the building, the former president saw an elderly woman cooking her breakfast over an open fire.\nThat view of the woman stuck with him. He wrote about it subsequently in at least one book, contrasting the image with the fact that he was in the richest city in the richest country on Earth.\nWhen we got out to his car, Carter said to me: \"Rob, Millard Fuller is my boss. If there's anything I can do to help you here, let him know.\"\nI blurted out: \"Well, maybe you can send up some volunteer carpenters from your church.\"\nHe said, \"I'll think about it,\" and the next day he called Millard Fuller and said he was not only going to send some carpenters, he was going to be one of the carpenters. That changed everything.\nThat was April of 1984 and they made plans to come up in September. They chartered a Trailways bus out of Atlanta, driving overnight to the church I was attending at the time, Metro Baptist on West 40th Street, near the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Hell's Kitchen.\nThey stayed on bunk beds in the church—including Carter—and then took a bus down to the Lower East Side each day, about a 20-minute ride. He worked throughout that week, but his first day of work was actually Labor Day in 1984.\nLabor Day used to be the official kickoff to the presidential race. Both Reagan and Walter Mondale were marching in Labor Day parades, and Mondale was in New York. Meantime, the former president was on the Lower East Side working in a rubble-strewn building.\nThe AP did a story prior to their coming and the interest exploded. Nowadays, you have sitting presidents working on Habitat projects. Habitat is a major charity today, but back then it was not well known.\nThe notion that a former leader of the free world would spend an entire week working eight to ten-hour days in a hot building in one of the roughest neighborhoods in New York City was just unfathomable.\nThe morning shows all broadcast from the Lower East Side. Carter did a press conference that Monday on the steps of the building, but he couldn't wait to get back to work.\nHe recognized what his presence would mean for the organization so he was willing to do a few interviews. But his real interest was in the work on the building. He had to be pulled away from the job, being the first to work and the last to lay off.\nIn subsequent years, I've heard he was surprised that a good deal of his image came from the Habitat experience. Maybe he was frustrated because the Carter Center was involved throughout the world in many things, from eradicating river blindness caused by Guinea worm in Africa to monitoring elections.\nBut he was most famously known for his Habitat work because it's so visual and dramatic.\nHabitat had never done anything like this before, having mostly worked on single-family homes. A 19-unit building in the most visible city in the world was something new, but it instantly put the organization on the global map.\nIt was also a major fundraising challenge. They were building houses for $30,000, but this thing ultimately cost over a million dollars. That didn't happen overnight, and things were slow, so Carter came back the following summer for a week.\nCarter was a runner, and one day, we actually jogged together from the Metro Baptist building down to the project site, about four miles, which was cool.\nAnother day, the whole group took the subway and walked through Times Square, then got on the subway and went down to the Lower East Side.\nOn the subway car, two older women saw him, asked me if that was who they thought it was and said no one in their family was going to believe they had shared a ride with the former President of the United States.\nThere was a good deal of buzz and it was a heady experience for me as a young man.\nI didn't have any long fireside chats with the former president. Our interactions tended to be more observational and informational than conversational, but he was serious about the work itself.\nThe second year, it was more finished work rather than gut rehab. This project, started in '84, stretched into '86. Early '86, I saw him at a board meeting. A good deal of his and Habitat's reputation was resting on this.\nWhen he asked about the project's progress, I said: \"We're gonna get a certificate of occupancy by June.\" He said, \"1986?\" It was humor with a barb, but we finally got it done and people moved in.\nA couple of years later, when he was in Charlotte, I went down to the project while he was there. Carter was sitting under a tree taking a break.\nTruth be known, I was a pretty good communicator but not a sterling administrator, and in my mid-20s I hardly knew how to run a project like that. I suspect our nascent board tapped me for the position because I was the only one available— AKA, unemployed. But finally, we got a board that recognized it was time for me to go.\nSo when I joined Carter in Charlotte I was on the cusp of leaving Habitat, looking to get into journalism or public relations. I asked him if he would write a letter of recommendation. He said no, but that I could give people his name and if anyone called, he would tell them what he knew about me.\nThat project, more symbolic than anything else, helped launch the visibility of Habitat. It wasn't going to address the critical housing need of East 6th Street, let alone New York City, but it served its purpose.\nJimmy Carter is often called the best former president we've ever had. He's a man who has lived his faith until the end. The contrast he offers to today's Christian nationalism and culture wars is stark.\nI was a fan of him as president, and I think, like everyone in that exalted position, he couldn't control everything. He didn't control the Iranian hostage crisis, or the staggering combination of inflation and unemployment, all that contributed to his being a one-term president.\nBut of this there is no doubt: He truly cared about the United States and the poor around the world, evident in the Carter Center's work in Africa and elsewhere.\nNo politician can suffer from a diminished self-concept and still be in the game, but what I've always admired about Carter is his humility.\nOn the first day of his work on our project, a foreign journalist asked how it felt to be \"a former vice president.\" Carter smiled and said that having never been a vice president, he couldn't say. Then, softly, \"it shows how fleeting fame is.\"\nNot long after, he told us about being in Japan and making a speech, leading with a joke. By his admission joke-telling was not his forte, but his led to an extended and surprising round of uproarious laughter.\nCarter later asked the translator what he said. Sheepishly, the translator admitted he just told the audience: \"President Carter just told a joke. Everyone laugh.\"\nHow many politicians can tell stories like that on themselves? That Carter could is evidence, for me, that his perspective has long been an eternal rather than a temporal one.\nAnd my short time with Habitat and Jimmy Carter was not just a seminal moment in my own life. It reinforced my own Christian faith.\nWhat are the chances that I'd pick up the Daily News that day and see a three-inch squib about Carter coming to New York? I have come to realize there are too many coincidences in my life to regard them as mere coincidences.\nExactly 40 years later, my \"accidental\" encounter with this remarkable man—and all that followed—remains Exhibit A.\nRob DeRocker is an economic development marketing consultant based in Tarrytown, NY and St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands.\nAll views expressed are the author's own.\nAs told to Shane Croucher.\nDo you have a unique experience or personal story to share?

    "content": "There’s nothing quite like settling back into your train seat, the urban skyline out the window fading into lush natural landscapes as you make your way to your next destination.\nAccording to rail experts, an increasing number of luxury travelers are looking to experience this sensation, all part of a global shift towards slower and more sustainable tourism activities.\nAnantara is among the hospitality giants now tapping into this demand, with the high-end hotel brand offering a new five-hour luxury train experience in southern Vietnam that connects the popular resort destinations of Na Trang and Quy Nhon – its second route in the country.\nThe first “The Vietage by Anantara” luxury train carriage launched in 2020 – a six-hour journey connecting Da Nang and Quy Nhon.\nAnanatara’s head of PR and marketing for Vietnam, Kate Jones tells CNN the new carriage heads in the opposite direction and aims to expose travelers to even more of Vietnam’s beautiful views. Like the first Vietage carriage, it will be attached to Vietnam’s state-run commercial railway that runs up and down the country.\n“The main difference is that the new route connecting Nha Trang and Quy Nhon passes through many more coastal areas than the journey between Da Nang and Quy Nhon,” says Jones.\n“There is a selection of really quite stunning bays and some striking coastline facing the East Sea. There are some mountainous areas and still plenty of rice paddies and lotus ponds, but the coastal scenery is the biggest view ‘pull’ for this five-hour journey.”\nThis is slow travel at its best – the trains hit an average speed of 51.9 kilometers per hour (32.2 mph) according to Anantara.\nThat gives guests on the Quy Nhon-Nha Trang route plenty of time to enjoy their complimentary afternoon tea set, which includes local caviar, Vietnamese artisanal cheeses, a selection of cold cuts and premium Vietnamese teas.\nFor the six-hour journeys between Da Nang and Quy Nhon, passengers are served a pre-ordered three-course gourmet meal.\nGuests on either route also get complimentary snacks, free-flow wine, cocktails, mocktails, teas, coffee and soft drinks, plus a 15-minute head and shoulder treatment.\nThe Vietage carriage is fitted out with a sit-up bar, restroom facilities and six private booths that seat two, each of which comes with power outlets, charging stations, free wifi and amenity baskets with pillows, blankets and other essentials.\nTravelers can reserve their seats online at Thevietagetrain.com, while those wanting to combine their rail journeys with a stay at one of Anantara’s properties – – Anantara Hoi An Resort, Anantara Quy Nhon Villas or Avani Quy Nhon Resort – can book packages through those individual hotel websites.\nThe cost of a one-way Vietage journey is $420 per person. The new route departs from Nha Trang Train Station at 2 p.m., arriving at Dieu Tri Station in Quy Nhon at 6:29 p.m. For those preferring to travel in the opposite direction, trains depart Dieu Tri Train Station at 2:15 p.m. - arriving at Nha Trang Train Station at 6:36 p.m.\nRelated article\nThis train route is being revived after over 100 years\nThe original route departs from Da Nang Train Station at 8 a.m., arriving at Quy Nhon’s Dieu Tri Station at 2:03 p.m. There is also an evening option that departs Quy Nhon at 7:00 p.m., arriving in Da Nang at 12:53 a.m. the following day. This Vietage journey is slightly cheaper, costing $315 per passenger.\nAs for demand, Jones says many are turning to rail travel rather than “rushing through airports to get from A to B.”\n“The domestic aviation industry in Vietnam right now is also facing some challenges with the disappearance of two airlines and a reduced fleet with the national carrier, so overall air travel is currently not popular, plus overly expensive,” she says.\n“The Vietage is the only experience of its kind in Vietnam and, of course, with the return of the Belmond train, the awareness of luxury rail travel is growing in Southeast Asia.”\nIn addition to traveling slowly and more sustainably, Jones says rail travelers gain real visual insights into the country, taking in scenes like “rural villages, fishermen casting their nets, farmers in fields with the water buffaloes – things you definitely don’t experience at 35,000 feet.”\n",

The champion diverged from racing tracks to tackle 20-foot waves, describing a moment when he believed \"it was all over.\"\nThe harrowing incident underscores the risks extreme sports pose even to seasoned athletes like Hamilton. Surfing with professional Kelly Slater—who warned him of the dangerous conditions—highlights the level of challenge and thrill-seeking inherent in Hamilton's off-track activities.\nHamilton recounted being advised against entering the water due to the overwhelming surfing conditions at Pipeline. Ignoring the risks, he plunged into the waters, only to find himself struggling in the \"kill zone,\" an area so fraught with danger that one wrong move could be catastrophic. He explained:\n\"Biggest wipeout I had I was with Kelly Slater, on Pipeline. It was like 20ft waves and Kelly was like 'there's no way you're coming out there. You're crazy.'\n\"I turn around and see this set of four waves coming and that for me was like: 'it's over, it's all over.' As I threw my board, I dove down and grabbed the reef and I could hear this wave crash behind me. My board got ripped and snapped in half.\n\"I came back up, obviously gasping for air and the next one was coming so back down, grabbed the reef again as another wave comes over. So I did that three times. I got up, I'd nearly run out of air. I'd nearly drowned, but managed to swim back from there.\"\nSpeaking about his passion for surfing during an interview with DAZN in 2021, Hamilton commented (translated by Google):\n\"It's my favorite sport. There are no phones, you merge with nature and feel more connected than ever to the world. That's the best feeling ever.\n\"I'm crazy because I always try to get on the big waves. I try to go under the wave, go up, go from one side to the other, but I'm not able to, obviously. Normally I have to swim a lot.\n\"The last time I went, I paddled out to a wave the size of this building. It was incredible. I had never experienced anything so terrifying. But I didn't catch the wave, I stayed on the side watching. That day, my board broke in two, I lost it... It was something intense.\"\n",

    "content": "TikTok said Wednesday it would suspend a controversial program in the European Union that has prompted growing alarm among EU regulators.\nThe program at issue appears within TikTok Lite, a less data-intensive version of TikTok’s main app, and which contains a feature that rewards users with cash for engaging with TikTok content and app features.\nRelated article\nBiden just signed a potential TikTok ban into law. Here’s what happens next\nTikTok said it was “voluntarily” suspending the rewards program after the European Commission announced Monday it could impose fines and a mandatory suspension over concerns that the feature may drive addiction by encouraging users to interact with the platform more.\n“TikTok always seeks to engage constructively with the EU Commission and other regulators,” TikTok said in a post on X. “We are therefore voluntarily suspending the rewards functions in TikTok Lite while we address the concerns that they have raised.”\nThe EU warnings to TikTok reflected an exercise of new oversight powers granted by the Digital Services Act, the trading bloc’s recently enacted law governing online platforms. In opening a probe into TikTok Lite earlier this week, the European Commission said that TikTok could be fined for failing to provide information it owes to the Commission about the app, including a risk assessment report and a separate report outlining steps the company has taken to minimize those risks.\nFailure to hand over the risk assessment and risk mitigation report could result in fines of up to 1% of TikTok’s global annual revenue and “periodic penalties” of up to 5% of TikTok’s average daily revenue, the Commission said previously. TikTok also faces further, additional fines of up to 6% of its global annual revenue if the TikTok Lite feature is determined to be in violation of the DSA.\nTikTok’s move to suspend TikTok Lite’s reward features in Europe, meanwhile, comes as it faces its biggest threat yet to its United States operations. President Joe Biden on Wednesday signed a bill that could lead to a nationwide TikTok ban, after Congress passed the bill earlier this week as part of a wide-ranging foreign aid package meant to support Israel and Ukraine. Under what is now US law, TikTok is forced to find a new owner within months or be banned from the United States entirely.\n",

There were no fatalities, he said, adding that 30 homes and 10 cars were damaged, without offering any further information about the source of the blast.\nNewsweek has reached out to the Russian Defense Ministry for comment via email.\nRussian glide-bombs have rained down on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, in recent months. Across the front line, Moscow has used adapted Soviet-era bombs, fitting the munitions with guidance kits and wings, to strike targets.\nRussian jets fire the precision-guided bombs out of the range of Kyiv's air defenses, and they glide towards their target, often with devastating effect. Ukrainian officials in Kharkiv have reported several strikes, including those using guided aerial bombs, in recent days.\nLast month, footage appeared to show a 1,500-kilogram (3,300-pound) converted bomb landing on a Russian-controlled village in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, although the munition did not detonate. Separately in April, Russian independent media outlet Astra reported that Moscow had mistakenly dropped a Kh-59 missile on a village in the Belgorod region.\nIn January, Russia bombed the village of Petropavlovka, in the country's Voronezh region, by mistake. The defense ministry said at the time that there had been an \"abnormal discharge of aircraft ammunition\" over the village, state media reported. A few days later, a Moscow-installed official said one of its jets had accidentally dropped a FAB-250 bomb on Rubizhne, in Ukraine's annexed Luhansk region.\nIn April 2023, a Russian warplane accidentally bombed Belgorod, causing a huge crater and a large explosion in the city.\n",

    "content": "The US government has asked leading artificial intelligence companies for advice on how to use the technology they are creating to defend airlines, utilities and other critical infrastructure, particularly from AI-powered attacks.\nThe Department of Homeland Security said Friday that the panel it’s creating will include CEOs from some of the world’s largest companies and industries.\nThe list includes Google chief executive Sundar Pichai, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella and OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, but also the head of defense contractors such as Northrop Grumman and air carrier Delta Air Lines.\nThe move reflects the US government’s close collaboration with the private sector as it scrambles to address both the risks and benefits of AI in the absence of a targeted national AI law.\nRelated article\nAI could disrupt the election. Congress is running out of time to respond\nThe collection of experts will make recommendations to telecommunications companies, pipeline operators, electric utilities and other sectors about how they can “responsibly” use AI, DHS said. The group will also help prepare those sectors for “AI-related disruptions.”\n“Artificial intelligence is a transformative technology that can advance our national interests in unprecedented ways,” said DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, in a release. “At the same time, it presents real risks — risks that we can mitigate by adopting best practices and taking other studied, concrete actions.”\nAmong the panel’s other participants are the CEOs of technology providers such as Amazon Web Services, IBM and Cisco; chipmakers such as AMD; AI model developers such as Anthropic; and civil rights groups such as the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.\nIt also includes federal, state and local government officials, as well as leading academics in AI such as Fei-Fei Li, co-director of Stanford University’s Human-centered Artificial Intelligence Institute.\nThe 22-member AI Safety and Security Board is an outgrowth of a 2023 executive order signed by President Joe Biden, who called for a cross-industry body to make “recommendations for improving security, resilience, and incident response related to AI usage in critical infrastructure.”\nThat same executive order also led this year to government-wide rules regulating how federal agencies can purchase and use AI in their own systems. The US government already uses machine learning or artificial intelligence for more than 200 distinct purposes, such as monitoring volcano activity, tracking wildfires and identifying wildlife from satellite imagery.\nMeanwhile, deepfake audio and video, which use AI to push fake content, have emerged as a key concern for US officials trying to protect the 2024 US election from rampant mis- and disinformation. A fake robocall in January imitating Biden’s voice urged Democrats not to vote in New Hampshire’s primary, sounding alarms among US officials focused on election security. A New Orleans magician told CNN that a Democratic political consultant hired him to make the robocall. But there is concern that foreign adversaries like Russia, China or Iran could exploit the same technology.\n“It is a risk that is real,” Mayorkas told reporters on Friday while discussing the AI advisory board. “We are seeing adverse nation-states engaged and we work to counter their efforts to unduly influence our elections.”\n",

    "content": "With so many options for a quick tweak here and a little lift there, it's no wonder that many across the world are rushing into beauty treatments in an effort to achieve a certain aesthetics. From breast enhancements to botulinum toxin, the result and recovery time may differ, but all these treatments are for often one reason only: looks.\nWith Statista revealing 70% of U.S. consumers considered some form of cosmetic procedure in 2023, there's bound to be a few regrets of overfilled lips or unnecessary nose jobs, but people are slow to admit they made mistakes when it comes to treatments. One woman is now owning up to her moments of misjudgment in the hopes of educating others on the importance of properly considering your options before booking in.\nMarta Mielczarska, a 30-year-old content creator living in Los Angeles, shared a TikTok video detailing five cosmetic treatments she'd undergone—and the reasons she regretted them.\nThe video has since gone viral, with over 100,000 views since it was shared in April, as users listened to Mielczarska's reasoning for why she regrets each treatment.\nMielczarska, who was \"blessed with giant eye bags,\" turned to under eye filler as an alternative to a fat removal surgery, as she said \"nobody's cutting me up near my eyes.\"\nAdmitting in the video, \"I know I'm not the best candidate for [this treatment] because I don't have hollow eyes,\" the filler added more volume to her face, with her sharing that although it did get rid of the bags she felt she \"just looked very almost swollen.\"\nSpeaking to Newsweek, Mielczarska shared \"The filler worked, however, to achieve the look we also had to put a little bit of filler in my cheeks to even out my face which gave me a overfilled, puffy face look.\"\nLuckily the filler has naturally thinned over the years, as she shared, \"I do not think I need to get it dissolved because the look I have now after three years is natural and not overfilled anymore.\"\nSticking to the injectables category, Mielczarska admitted, \"I've had some bad Botox before in my life. It did not look cute.\n\"Same goes for the lip filler. I've found a really good person, but I've had some really bad lip filler before.\"\nHer main regret for these treatments weren't the procedures themselves, but the practitioners she chose to see, as she told Newsweek, \"It's difficult because you don't know until you know. You always think that people who do injections know what they are doing since it is literally their profession.\n\"I was looking for cheapest options and that is not always the best when it comes to your face. Now, I have a couple of trusted places for specific things and I will not be experimenting with new ones to not make any mistakes again.\"\nAnother area she wished she'd left alone was her eyebrows, as she said in the video: \"I've done it probably eight years ago, and it was supposed to last only a year, but it's still there and it's not going away.\n\"It just looks very weird and faded. They did a really good job, but still, I wish I never got it.\"\nSpeaking to Newsweek, Mielczarska admitted to being influenced by others when it came to this treatment, as she shared, \"Microblading was popping and I hopped on the trend.\n\"I also remember being 20 and waking up with friends at the same house and my girlfriend making a comment asking, 'Marta, where are your eyebrows?' and that made me even more self-conscious .\n\"At the time I liked the results because I finally had eyebrows, but now they look faded and not as fresh and I do not want to redo them as the trend has passed. I was not blessed with a lot of brow hair as I am naturally blonde, so I am still searching for a better solution for lush 'trendy' brows.\"\nSomething she called a \"serious addiction,\" Mielczarska is pulling back on her lash extensions, despite them being part of her routine for eight years.\nShe told Newsweek, \"They make my life so easy cause I wake up and I am ready to go. I took a little break during COVID because salons were closed, but I was putting falsies almost every day which was extremally annoying.\n\"Now, I am just torn in between convenience and nature. I want a natural look and I see the videos of girls getting them removed and they look absolutely beautiful and much better without them, but somehow I cannot explain to myself that I will look better when I take them off.\"\nAfter a botched initial surgery, Mielczarska was forced to go under the knife for a second time just a few years later. Upon reflection, she shared that, \"I wish I never did it, and I'm really considering an explant right now.\"\nShe told Newsweek, \"From what I hear, a lot of surgeons suggest you go bigger than you want for your first augmentation cause you will regret going too small and this is what I did—which I absolutely shouldn't).\n\"I have a fairly small frame and the implants that were put on me the first time looked absolutely ridiculous! I felt like it's the breast and me behind them. They completely did not match my frame or my personality.\n\"On top of that, three years after, I had complication—double bubble, when the implant drops below the pocket creating the look of a double bubble—and I hated looking at myself in the mirror.\"\nAfter seeking help from a new doctor she was able to get the results she'd initially wanted, but despite that Mielczarska said, \"I could not be happier with the new results, but in general I wish I never got it because looking from the perspective I was young and I definitely did not need that to feel confident.\n\"Now I am thinking about having plastic in my body and it does not make me feel good. I do not know if I am going to be brave enough to remove them completely, but maybe one day!\"\nOverall, her experiences have made her rethink the way she approaches cosmetic treatments, as she said, \"I am definitely not going to be doing any major treatments ever again, but rather focus more on my skin condition and smaller things like anti-wrinkle injections.\n\"All the mistakes I made were because I was young, I did not have money to get good care and right treatment and I was not educated enough in that area. Now I know better how to make the right choice and have trusted places that I know will not let me make those mistakes again.\"\n",

    "content": "Former President Donald Trump's guilty verdict could represent a blow to his presidential campaign.\nTrump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, faced trial in New York City on 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment allegedly made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg alleged the payment was meant to prevent her from speaking publicly about her claims of having an affair with the former president.\nOn Thursday, a jury handed down a guilty verdict on all 34 felony counts following the trial, which lasted more than a month throughout April and May, while several states held their primary nominating contests.\n\"This was a disgrace. This was a rigged trial by a conflicted judge who was corrupt,\" Trump said outside the courtroom following the verdict.\nTrump, who has long denounced the prosecution as a \"witch hunt,\" has said he is innocent of all charges in this case and other criminal and civil cases he is facing.\nSentencing is scheduled for 10:00 a.m. on July 11, just four days before the Republican National Convention.\nTammy Vigil, a senior associate dean at Boston University's College of Communication, told Newsweek that the verdict will complicate his campaign.\n\"This might result in increased motivation to turn out to make sure the nation does not elect a convicted felon to the presidency,\" she said.\nStill, he is likely to continue to \"protest his innocence\" and may even fundraise off of the verdict, she said. His most ardent supporters are likely to continue supporting him, regardless of the verdict.\nGrant Davis Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University, said that undecided voters may have \"pause\" before voting for Trump due to the guilty verdict while they weigh other factors and concerns.\nHe said that the effect may be marginal, limited to only true undecided voters, but that that could still matter due to the close nature of the election.\nThe guilty verdict could have negative consequences for his presidential campaign, according to some polls.\nTrump has held a narrow, yet consistent, polling lead over President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, for months. But the verdict may convince some voters currently backing Trump to instead vote for Biden in November, according to polls.\nA Marquette Law School poll, conducted among 902 registered voters nationwide from May 6 to 15, found that a significant number of voters would abandon Trump in the case of a guilty verdict.\nThe poll found that in a scenario where Trump was found guilty, 43 percent of respondents backed Biden, while 39 percent said they would vote for Trump. But when asked who they would vote for if Trump were found not guilty, 44 percent said they would vote for Trump, and 38 percent said they would vote for Biden.\nThe poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.6 percentage points.\nMeanwhile, an ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted from April 25 to 30 found that 1 in 5 Trump supporters would reconsider or withdraw their support for Trump in the case of a guilty verdict. The sample size of the subgroup of Trump supporters was 937 adults with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4.\nNotably, he still faces three other criminal trials. Department of Justice (DOJ) Special Prosecutor Jack Smith has led two investigations, one of which focuses on alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and the other deals with classified documents found at Trump's Mar-a-Lago property in Florida.\nMeanwhile, Trump is also expected to eventually face trial in Fulton County District Attorney's investigation into alleged attempts at election interference in Georgia, a swing state that backed Biden in 2020.\nHowever, it remains unclear whether any of these trials will be held before the presidential election in November, as all have faced delays in recent months. Trump has pleaded not guilty to charges in each of those cases.\n",

    "content": "Around Australia, travelers are stranded and trying to get home after low-cost airline Bonza unexpectedly announced it has “temporarily suspended services.”\nThe airline, Australia’s newest, had a fleet of six planes, all painted a bright purple color and given Aussie-inspired names like Sheila and Matilda.\nAccording to a report in CNN affiliate 9News, Bonza is now in severe financial trouble.\nIn a statement made on April 30, Bonza CEO Tim Jordan reportedly said that “discussions are currently underway regarding the ongoing viability of the business.”\n“We apologize to our customers who are impacted by this,” he added.\nRelated article\nHow the pandemic killed off 64 airlines\nCatherine King, Australia’s transportation minister, told reporters Tuesday that she had spoken with representatives from Bonza and urged them to keep passengers fully informed.\n“We have made it very clear to Bonza that our expectations are that they inform passengers about what their options are, what changes are being made, and that they respect their consumer rights, of which they do have some,” King said.\n“Our focus right at the moment is to assist Australian passengers who are stranded at the end of school holidays.”\nBonza launched with much fanfare in January 2023, using the slogan “Here for Allstralia.” It specialized in flying to smaller, under-served destinations like Launceston in Tasmania and Gladstone in Queensland.\nWhile that was a boon for residents of those areas, it has proven an additional challenge among those now struggling to get back home following Tuesday’s flight cancellations.\nRelated article\n‘I want to get off the plane.’ The passengers refusing to fly on Boeing’s 737 Max\nQantas, Australia’s largest air carrier, services only six of the 36 routes that Bonza has been flying. The airline said that any affected Bonza passenger can get a free ticket on a Qantas or Jetstar flight where seats are available, and has encouraged affected customers to call their hotline for help.\nVirgin Australia has also stepped into the breach.\n“We will immediately support any passengers stranded mid-journey by offering complimentary seats on Virgin Australia-operated flights to the airport nearest to their final planned Bonza destination,” the airline wrote on X (formerly Twitter).\nBonza’s last Instagram post went up on April 28.\nCurrently, the company’s website is still online, but it’s not possible to book flights and all travel dates appear blacked out.\n",

Newsweek emailed X and a spokesperson for Trump for comment Thursday.\nTrump's post was flooded with replies from people sharing their dissatisfaction with the update.\n\"He is hiding that he can possibly like a porn tweet, a racist tweet, or whatever it is that he doesn't want everyone to see. My take, he only has access to it and he will in the future use it against anyone who goes after and against him,\" one person theorized.\n\"I'm sure he's doing it for his vanity, just like Trump. Elon couldn't stand criticism on Twitter, so he bought it to control it. Now, I'm betting he couldn't stand people pointing out the various disgusting and conspiratorial posts he likes, so he got rid of it,\" said another.\n\"What if everybody were to post \"like [heart emoji]\" in every single post they like? I'm sure that wouldn't mess up everyone's feed! [laugh crying emoji],\" someone else wrote.\nA fourth person added: \"I wish we could sue him for this platform he destroyed.\"\nNot everyone is unhappy, as some people have taken to Musk's post about the news to tell him that they welcome the update.\n\"Great new feature Elon. Will definitely help users feel more comfortable liking posts that they agree with,\" responded the controversial English internet personality Oli London.\n\"Good move. It's a step toward providing people with more privacy. If people want to share what they like, they can repost the content,\" wrote social media personality Ed Krassenstein.\n\"It's sad that people will get attacked for liking something,\" another person added.\nThis news comes after X updated its policy to allow what it calls \"consensually produced and distributed\" adult content on the platform, a move that has sparked criticism on social media that it will damage the user experience.\n\"We believe that users should be able to create, distribute, and consume material related to sexual themes as long as it is consensually produced and distributed. Sexual expression, visual or written, can be a legitimate form of artistic expression,\" X's page on \"adult content\" policies reads.\n\"We believe in the autonomy of adults to engage with and create content that reflects their own beliefs, desires, and experiences, including those related to sexuality. We balance this freedom by restricting exposure to Adult Content for children or adult users who choose not to see it.\"\nThe platform noted that it will restrict such content behind a warning before users can access it. It would require that those who post on the platform change their settings to allow for such warnings.\n\"If you regularly post adult content on X, we ask that you please adjust your media settings,\" it said about the policy last month. \"Doing so places all your images and videos behind a content warning that needs to be acknowledged before your media can be viewed. You can also add a one-time content warning on individual posts. If you continue to fail marking your posts, we will adjust your account settings for you.\"\nThe policy suggested that underage users will not be able to access the content.\n\"Users under 18 or viewers who do not include a birth date on their profile cannot click to view marked content,\" it said.\n",

    "content": "Vladimir Putin, Muammar Gaddafi, Mark Zuckerberg. Presidents and Hollywood stars; political dissidents, abuse survivors and immigrants. One thing unites them all: a slightly scuffed, white wooden box.\n“More world leaders have sat on that box than any chair in history,” the photographer Platon, owner of that very box, told CNN in an interview conducted over Zoom. For some world leaders, the scarcity of his set — sitting on the box in front of a plain black or white sheet of paper — can be intimidating, stripping them of their usual grandeur. For others it’s liberating, allowing the human to shine through the professional storyteller. For the subjects of Platon’s new book “The Defenders,” the box became an opportunity.\n“There’s a statement that’s quite common in the human rights community,” Platon said. “‘Giving a voice to the voiceless’. I have learned through my experiences that it’s not right to say that. They have beautiful, powerful, strong voices; the issue is that those voices have been ignored.” Through his work, he explained his mission is to help amplify people’s stories, tuning into their humanity as though they were “an old-fashioned radio”.\nBorn in Greece in 1968, Platon Antoniou moved to the UK aged eight and completed his studies in photography at the Royal College of Art, before leaving London for a career in New York. There, he worked on George magazine with John Kennedy Jr. and as a staff photographer at the New Yorker magazine.\n“The Defenders” takes a different tack to Platon’s earlier work. As a young photographer, he confessed he was dazzled by the world of politicians and celebrities he was working with, walking the corridors of the Kremlin and Downing Street and “having a chat about life” in George Clooney’s garden. Turning his lens to the powerless, by contrast, has upturned his ideas of power altogether.\nRelated article\nThe photographer who changed the way the world saw New York\n“Having photographed all these world leaders, often the people I meet in the trenches of the human rights movement are proper leaders,” he said. “They transform their adversity into compassion for others. And that’s something I very rarely see on that level in the political sphere. So I called them — I call the book — “The Defenders,” because it’s a superhero title. These are ordinary people who do extraordinary things, and I do think of them as superheroes. Changing the narrative is very important for me.”\nAmong “The Defenders” are Burmese and Egyptian dissidents, the imprisoned Russian punk band Pussy Riot, and survivors of sexual violence at Dr. Denis Mukwege’s Panzi Hospital in Congo. One of the girls that Platon photographed there was Esther Faraja. She appeared in an episode of Netflix’s “Abstract: The Art of Design,” profiling Platon, although he said the details of the trauma she suffered were “too harsh to put in the film.”\n“As I was taking the picture, she wasn’t crying,” he recalled. “I’m a privileged, middle-aged white man, and I’m a mess. I said to her, ‘how is it that I’m crying, and you’re not crying? And yet, you’re the one that has suffered?’ And she said: ‘the reason I don’t cry in your picture is because I don’t want to make you feel sad. I don’t want anyone to feel sad when they look at a picture of me. My mommy and daddy brought me into this world to bring joy to the world. And I will keep my promise’.” Platon is as awestruck now as he was standing in front of her. “Now that is a leader,” he said. “I made a promise to her that I will deliver her message of compassion and strength, combined, to as many people as I can.”\n“The Defenders” is an attempt to tell dozens of stories like hers, each captured in one 500th of a second. “Time is a very interesting concept; it doesn’t really ever exist,” Platon mused. “You try to freeze a moment that helps us understand the past and will still be relevant in the future. And yet, it was a moment in the present. And it was such a tiny fragment of a moment that if you blinked, you wouldn’t even have seen it.”\nTwo political giants offer obvious examples of time’s bizarre effect. Vladimir Putin, photographed by Platon for Time’s Person of the Year in 2007, initially liked the image that Platon produced. He appears powerful. In the time since its publication, however, the same image has been taken, edited, and circulated by political dissidents to mock Putin and belittle his power.\nRelated article\nWhy this morning-after portrait of Faye Dunaway became an iconic Hollywood moment\n“I heard in the last two years that anyone who’s caught circulating my picture in connection with human rights issues will go to jail,” Platon said. “Now, it’s the same picture. And Putin likes it.”\nBill Clinton, on a December 2000 cover of Esquire courtesy of Platon, has also been changed with age. “At the time, that picture represented insane levels of charisma,” Platon recalled. “He was great with people — everyone says there’s no one more charismatic than Bill Clinton. We look at it through a different lens now, but it’s the same picture. When I get it right, that same picture works for everybody.”\nIt doesn’t work for Hillary Clinton, though. “Hillary refuses to sit for me,” Platon noted. “She’s one of the only politicians who’s ever said no. And that’s interesting. The ‘no’ now is actually as interesting as the ‘yes’.”\nDistilling broad, complicated, emotional human stories into one fleeting moment is a tribulation of all photography, including that of world leaders, but it was particularly difficult when it came to the sensitive topics broached in “The Defenders”. “Many of (the people photographed) risk their lives and their security telling me these stories,” Platon said. “I cannot be reckless. I cannot be — I must not be — a thrill-seeker.”\nExerting due diligence and handling sensitive subjects thoughtfully is something that Platon admits is a luxury of time; he is able to spend months on a project, producing the most considered and provoking images he can. Increasingly, however, a lot of the photography flooding social media is taken hastily, captured on phones and shared without so much as a pause for breath. In “The Defenders,” Platon remembers the Burmese politician Aung San Suu Kyi coming out of house arrest and being bewildered by the sea of smartphones pointed at her.\n“Now everyone’s a photographer, and everyone’s a filmmaker,” Platon observed. “In many ways, that’s fantastic. People are holding the powers that be accountable in a new way. The danger is that there’s so much information that we’re constantly distracted. It’s very difficult to get that moment of reflection and pause, and to stand back and think for yourself. As you’re even doing that, your phone is dinging and clicking and beeping — it’s constant noise.”\nIn standing back, Platon was able to join the dots between the movements he was documenting; they weren’t isolated struggles, he realized, but connected ones. “Obviously each geopolitical situation is inherently different, but they are all fighting for very basic human principles,” he said. “I photographed LGBTQ+ defenders in Burma and in Russia. That’s two very, very different countries, with the same cause.”\nIn capturing and amplifying the stories of “The Defenders,” Platon hopes to inspire and instruct other people, just as he was inspired and instructed.\n“It’s really a handbook to the new generation to say: roll up your sleeves, get involved. Society needs a new generation of activists who will think differently. They will have a different path to navigate, but the principles remain timeless and the same. It’s the principles that unite us all. The way we fight, the tools we fight with, the strategies — we have to change those, because times change. But the principles stay the same.”\n“The Defenders”, published by MW Editions, is available now.\n",

    "content": "Soccer is becoming firmly entrenched in mainstream pop culture with hit television shows like “Ted Lasso” and “Welcome to Wrexham,” the documentary series detailing Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney’s ownership of the Welsh soccer club, introducing the sport to new audiences in the US and abroad – as Chris Ewing is quickly discovering.\nOn any given evening, Ewing receives emails informing him that some fan in a far-flung location – say, Los Angeles – has just invested in his tiny Scottish soccer club, the Caledonian Braves.\n“Then 10 minutes later, there would be someone from Australia invest in the club and it’s just like, ‘Wow, I can’t believe it,’” Ewing, the club’s founder, tells CNN Sport.\nNestled in the leafy outskirts of Motherwell, a town about 20 kilometers southeast of Glasgow, the Caledonian Braves play in the Scottish fifth division with a team of mostly amateur players at a ground with capacity for just 500 fans.\nBut, despite its small home, Ewing’s vision of creating a fan-owned club, steeped in values of diversity and community with ambitions of reaching the Scottish Premier League, has attracted more than $300,000 in investment from more than 1,000 owners around the world, far outstripping the annual running costs of about $58,000, he says.\nAmong those owners include an NBA player, an NBA coach and a players’ union executive as well as soccer players in the US’ National Women Super League (NWSL). Investors in 49 US states have bought in – Wyoming is the only state pending on the list, he says.\n“A community club, most people would think, is a local community bound by a certain geography,” says Ewing.\n“But I think that today when we have internet, we have social media, we have an app as well that promotes fan engagement, I feel like a community can be just shared ideals and shared values, and it can be global.”\nVisiting Scotland and learning about the country’s history was an “amazing” experience for Mujtaba Elgoodah, one of the club’s lead investors, he remembers.\nMore used to basketball than soccer, Elgoodah was the manager of team development for the Golden State Warriors when they won the 2022 NBA title and is now part of the National Basketball Players’ Association executive leadership team.\nBut, when braving the bitterly cold Scottish weather to visit the club in February, he discovered “there is nothing like a good football match,” Elgoodah tells CNN Sport.\n“Just seeing the intensity and even picking up different slang words that the crowd was throwing out there was amazing too,” he adds.\nElgoodah had been intrigued by the Braves’ story and ethos when he happened across their story on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, last year.\nHe set about assembling a group of investors who could appreciate both soccer’s potential for growth and the importance of community alongside his longtime investment partner Nassir Criss, a serial entrepreneur and venture capitalist.\nTogether, they involved NWSL’s Kansas City Current stars Elizabeth Ball, Kristen Hamilton and Hailie Mace with their wealth of soccer knowledge, and introduced Boston Celtics performance coach Isaiah Covington to Ewing after he had also noticed the club’s story on social media.\n“I didn’t grow up around soccer,” Covington recalls. “But in the last few years, I have a host of nieces and nephews and that’s all they play now.”\nThough still nowhere near as popular as American football or basketball, soccer is the fastest-growing sport in the US and the most popular choice for adults under the age of 30. As a high school sport alone, it has grown by almost 300% in the last 40 years.\n“You see … all these celebrities owning football clubs, it’s kind of the new wave that people are on,” Hamilton says.\n“And so I think that that’s been a really huge, powerful movement in the US saying, ‘Hey, you know, we can’t own an NFL team, but we can own a small football team.’”\nWith its idea for lots of small investors helping it achieve huge ambitions, the Braves embodies an American style “entrepreneurial spirit,” Criss tells CNN Sport.\n“How do we take something new that no one’s ever really heard of, this wee club with massive ambitions to being a global franchise and pour in resources, community, people to actually accelerate that on a very big scale,” he says.\nAs more and more money pours into soccer, the gap between fans and owners has become a cavern at many clubs. In the battle for soccer’s soul, the two groups are often pitted against each other – the fans as representing the history and traditions of the sport, the owners cast as turning clubs into commercial entities or vehicles for sportswashing.\nAgainst this backdrop, fan ownership has emerged as somewhat of a utopian panacea for some fans.\nWhile it is still an unusual model in the UK, particularly in the English Premier League and Championship where clubs operate at huge losses, the Braves are not the first to pursue this goal.\nThey were set up as a company limited by shares in 2022 meaning that fans can buy into it, and expect to file their first set of accounts in October. Ewing founded a previous attempt at this ownership model from 2019 to 2021 but dissolved it before ever trading, he says.\nIn Scotland, fans have become majority owners at topflight clubs St Mirren, Motherwell and Heart of Midlothian in recent years while several others, including Rangers and Celtic, count fans among their minority owners.\nIn German soccer culture, meanwhile, the 50+1 concept of fan majority ownership is deeply entrenched thereby giving fans more of a say in the running of clubs, a model Ewing says he hopes to eventually emulate.\nBut fan ownership isn’t easy, namely working out how to marshal hundreds of opinions into some sort of coherent opinion.\nEwing, who doesn’t take a salary from the club, admits that managing expectations has proved challenging “because people think they can just say, okay, let’s do x, y, z.”\n“With the best intentions in the world, it’s maybe not as easy as that, but I think as well, the big thing for me is that people get to love the highs and the lows.”\nThe Braves have an app and Discord channel, helping to foster this sense of community and allowing fan owners to have a voice on the direction of the club. Fans picked the club’s name, logo and the name of its ground – Alliance Park.\nAllowing fans this ownership over the team is proving infectious, its investors are finding.\n“Anytime I ever post about the Braves … people will DM me and be like, “’Who’s this team … and how do I get involved?’” Ball says.\nSuch a project is a marked difference from Ewing’s original venture, Edusport Academy, which he established in 2011, intending to provide a place for promising young soccer players, mostly from France, to hone their craft and learn English.\nAs time went by, the academy’s first team started playing in the Scottish soccer leagues and separated to form the Caledonian Braves in 2019.\nNow, as the Braves continue to grow, it has set its sights on rising up through the leagues but in a sustainable way that preserves the club for years to come.\n“(We’re) flipping the narrative that you don’t have to be Tom Brady or Matthew McConaughey or Ryan Reynolds,” says Ewing. “You can be anyone really from anywhere and you can also own a football club for as little as $100.”\n",

    "content": "Tech teams are working harder than ever in today's technology-driven world. As with teams across any department, extra support is critical when the scope of the work expands.\nTo help, 12 Newsweek Expert Forum members offer their tips for boosting support geared specifically toward tech teams. Whether you're exploring continuous learning opportunities or improving collaboration tools, these strategies can help you enhance support for your tech teams and foster innovation.\nOne effective way for companies to better support their tech teams is by investing in ongoing training and development opportunities. Providing access to relevant courses, workshops and conferences keeps tech professionals updated on the latest trends and technologies. Creating a collaborative culture that fosters knowledge sharing among team members increases productivity and job satisfaction. - Jason Hennessey, Hennessey Digital\nOne way companies can support their tech teams is by being proactive with open communication and process updates. Often, tech teams are very siloed. It's important for companies to bring their greater technology teams into more strategy and higher-level conversations to bridge knowledge and understanding gaps between business and technology. This often leads to greater innovation. - Chloe Alpert, Enobl\nThe best way for companies to support tech teams is to be nimble in their approach to methodologies and be open to new ways of doing things. Oftentimes, new tech becomes available to help streamline operations and communications but is late to be adopted due to technophobia on the management side. Be willing to embrace new tech that is introduced when it's appropriate, even if it's unfamiliar. - Henry Kurkowski, eWireless\nTech companies can lean into the use of artificial intelligence tools for their employees. Instead of only instrumenting policies to avoid its use due to concerns over regulations and privacy, provide healthy, compliant parameters that enable your teams to learn how best to drive efficiency with AI. AI is as transformative as general availability was in the 1990s, and it's here to stay. - Sabina Pons, Growth Molecules\nEnsure that your tech teams are up to date with the latest training and developments they need to remain at the peak of their game. AI and blockchain are some of the new buzzwords. Decide if a new technology direction is for your company, then ensure that your teams are properly trained and certified in those. - Zain Jaffer, Zain Ventures\nI would propose innovation sabbaticals, which are more structured and periodic breaks that allow tech team members to explore personal projects or new technologies unrelated to their normal work endeavors. This initiative aims to blend professional development with psychological restoration. Inevitably, it leads to greater creativity while also ensuring individuals update their tech knowledge and skills. - Dr. Kira Graves, Kira Graves Consulting\nIt's important to be proactive and listen to your tech team to stay up-to-date with state-of-the-art methods for improvement. Our tech team excelled when we followed this approach years ago. - Tammy Sons, Tn Nursery\nIn today's technology-driven world, companies can better support their tech teams by encouraging continuous learning. Provide professional development opportunities. By investing in training programs, workshops and certifications, companies empower their tech teams to stay updated with the latest trends and technologies, fostering innovation and growth within the organization. - Anna Yusim, MD, Yusim Psychiatry, Consulting & Executive Coaching\nEncourage experimentation. Many tech teams enjoy tinkering. Having permission to experiment \"on the job\" provides a productive and fun counterpoint alongside the running of business activities. Experimentation also often builds a sense of camaraderie that pays dividends in other ways. - Karen Mangia, The Engineered Innovation Group\nRecognize and address the unhealthy habits prevalent in tech teams that can lead to burnout and disengagement, including excessive screen time. It's common for employees to become consumed by projects and deadlines, neglecting their well-being in the process. However, this all-or-nothing approach isn't sustainable. Companies need to encourage a workable balance between perseverance and recovery. - Leah Marone, Corporate Wellness Consultant\nTech teams need help dealing with non-tech people. Sometimes, it is hard for tech professionals to read the minds of non-tech colleagues. Investing in an \"interpreter,\" like a good project manager who can be the glue between the different teams, can be very useful to avoid misunderstandings and put less pressure on the tech team. - Krisztina Veres, Veres Career Consulting\nContinuous training can help address any existing skill gaps within the team. Prioritizing this will ensure that all members are proficient and can handle the demands of their projects effectively. - Britton Bloch, Navy Federal\n",

    "content": "President Joe Biden has suggested he will appoint progressive justices to the Supreme Court if he wins a second term in the White House in November.\n\"The next president, they're going to be able to appoint a couple of justices... Look, if in fact we're able to change some of the justices when they retire and put in really progressive judges like we've always had, tell me that won't change your life,\" he said during a campaign rally in Philadelphia on Wednesday.\nThe conservative justices appointed by his rival, former President Donald Trump, are \"already gutting voting rights, overturning Roe, decimating affirmative action, and so much more,\" Biden said. \"Are we going to let that happen? We can't.\"\nNewsweek has contacted the Biden and Trump campaigns for comment via email.\nThe comments serve as a warning about the high stakes of November's election, given Trump's appointment of three justices in one term in office cemented the Supreme Court's 6-3 conservative majority.\nTwo of the court's conservative justices—Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito—are in their seventies, while Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal, will turn 70 next month.\nIf Biden wins in November and has the opportunity to nominate justices to replace any who retire, his appointments could affect the county for decades.\nTrump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has promised to appoint more conservative justices if he wins back the White House.\n\"You know many presidents never get the opportunity to appoint a Supreme Court justice. I had three, they are gold,\" he said at an event in 2023. \"And maybe we'll get three or four more. Can you imagine? Let's have seven. Let's have seven or eight or maybe even nine.\"\nBiden's comments on Wednesday were part of a renewed effort to mobilize Black voters ahead of November's election. Black voters helped secure Biden's 2020 win, but some polling has suggested Biden is losing support among the key demographic.\nAt Girard College, a boarding school with a predominantly Black student body, Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris thanked Black voters for sending them to the White House in 2020 and argued that their agenda has massively improved the lives of Black Americans.\nBiden pointed to his appointment of Ketanji Brown Jackson as the first Black female justice on the Supreme Court as a \"promise made and a promise kept.\"\n\"Because you voted, I was able to keep my commitment to appoint the first Black woman on the United States Supreme Court—Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson,\" he said.\n\"And I appointed more Black women to the federal circuit courts than every other president in American history combined.\"\nHarris also pointed to the lasting impact of Trump's presidency on the nation's highest court, saying he had \"handpicked three members\" of the Supreme Court \"with the intention that they would overturn Roe vs. Wade,\" the landmark 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.\n\"And as he intended, they did,\" Harris said. \"If he wins a second term, I promise you: He's going to go even further. So, all of this is to say, who sits in the White House matters.\"\nUpdate 5/30/25, 3:35 a.m. ET: This article has been updated to add additional information.\n",

    "content": "Moscow has accused the U.S. and other allies of Ukraine of preparing strikes on Crimea, warning that in such a scenario, there would be \"retaliation.\"\nRussian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told a briefing on Friday that the Crimean bridge, which links Russia with the peninsula illegally annexed by Moscow since 2014, was \"again under attack.\"\nOver the course of the war started by Vladimir Putin, there have been repeated strikes on the bridge, also known as the Kerch Bridge. The structure for Kyiv symbolizes Russian occupation but is also a key link to transport Moscow's troops and equipment to the frontline and a strike on it could impact its war effort.\nAs well as the bridge, Ukraine has also stepped up its attacks on Russian naval assets in the wider region with repeated strikes on vessels and infrastructure belonging to the Black Sea Fleet, much of which Moscow has relocated to Novorossiysk, in Russia's Krasnodar region.\nZakharova said preparations \"are being carried out openly, with ostentatious bravado and with the absolute and direct support of the collective West.\"\nShe referred to the reported delivery of U.S.-supplied ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems) long range missiles last month, citing the Russian defense ministry's claim that six of the missiles had been shot down over the peninsula last week.\nU.S. officials said last month that Kyiv had started using ATACMS missiles for the first time on a Russian military airfield in Crimea, hitting Russian forces in another occupied area.\nWashington had first delivered mid-range older models of ATACMS missiles last year with a shorter range of around 100 miles but the newer missiles have a range of up to 190 miles, potentially putting hundreds of Russian military facilities in Crimea within range.\nIn her briefing, Zakharova also noted reports that Kyiv was set to receive its first delivery of F-16 aircraft, \"which, according to the British, can also be used in the operation to destroy the Crimean Bridge.\"\n\"We would like to once again warn Washington, London and Brussels that any aggressive actions against Crimea are not only doomed to failure, but will also receive an indestructible blow of retaliation,\" she said, without specifying further.\nNewsweek has contacted the U.S. State Department for comment.\nFollowing her comments, the Russian defense ministry said on Saturday its air defense forces shot down four ATACMS missiles over the Crimean Peninsula, claiming that they had successfully downed 15 of the missiles in recent weeks.\nRussia often claims to have downed Ukrainian missiles and drones without reporting damage, although later reports can show how military targets or infrastructure have actually been struck.\n",

    "publishedAt": "12:32 PM EDT, Wed April 24, 2024",
    "content": "A portrait by Gustav Klimt that was unseen for almost a century has sold for $32 million – the bottom end of its pre-auction estimate.\nThe “Portrait of Fräulein Lieser,” thought to be one of the Austrian painter’s final works, created huge excitement in the art world, but it ended up selling at the lower end of its valuation of €30 million-€50 million ($32 million to $53.4 million).\nBids started at €28 million and the work went for a hammer price of €30 million. This does not include the auction house’s fees.\nThe sale price was less than half that fetched by another Klimt painting – “Dame mit Fächer” (Lady with a Fan) – in London last year. The last portrait completed by Klimt became the most expensive artwork ever to sell at a European auction, when it sold for a £85.3 million ($108.4 million).\nRelated article\nKlimt portrait missing for nearly a century could sell for $54 million\nThe “Portrait of Fräulein Lieser” had long been considered lost, according to Vienna auction house im Kinsky. However, it recently emerged that it had been privately owned by an Austrian citizen.\n“The rediscovery of this portrait, one of the most beautiful of Klimt’s last creative period, is a sensation,” the auction house said in a press statement on its website prior to its sale on Wednesday afternoon.\nThe intensely vivid and colorful piece had been documented in catalogues of the artist’s work, but experts had only seen it in a black and white photo.\nThe sitter is known to have been a member of a wealthy Austrian Jewish family who were then part of the upper class of Viennese society, where Klimt found his patrons and clients. Nevertheless, her identity is not completely certain.\nBrothers Adolf and Justus Lieser were leading industrialists in the Austro-Hungarian empire. Catalogues of Klimt’s work state that Adolf commissioned the artist to paint his teenage daughter Margarethe Constance. However, new research by the auction house suggests Justus’ wife, Lilly, hired him to paint one of their two daughters.\nThe statement on the auctioneer’s website reveals that the sitter – whoever she was – visited Klimt’s studio nine times in April and May 1917. He made at least 25 preliminary studies and most likely began the painting in the May of that year.\n“The painter chose a three-quarter portrait for his depiction and shows the young woman in a strictly frontal pose, close to the foreground, against a red, undefined background. A cape richly decorated with flowers is draped around her shoulders,” the auction house said.\nIt added: “The intense colors of the painting and the shift towards loose, open brushstrokes show Klimt at the height of his late period.”\nWhen the artist died of a stroke the following February, the painting was still in his studio — with some small parts not quite finished. It was then given to the Lieser family.\nIts exact fate after 1925 is “unclear,” according to the auction house.\n“What is known is that it was acquired by a legal predecessor of the consignor in the 1960s and went to the current owner through three successive inheritances,” the statement said.\nThe painting was to be sold on behalf of its Austrian owners, who have not been named, along with the legal successors of “Adolf and Henriette Lieser based on an agreement in accordance with the Washington Principles of 1998,” the auction house said.\nEstablished in 1998, the Washington Principles charged participating nations with returning Nazi-confiscated art to their rightful owners.\nRelated article\nRussian billionaire loses Sotheby’s art fraud lawsuit involving ‘Salvator Mundi’\nClaudia Mörth-Gasser, specialist in modern art at im Kinsky, explained the situation in an email to CNN.\nShe said the auctioneer checked the painting’s history and provenance “in all possible ways in Austria,” adding: “We have checked all archives and have found no evidence that the painting has ever been exported out of Austria, confiscated or looted.”\nBut by the same token, she added: “We have no proof that the painting has not ever been looted in the time gap between 1938 and 1945.”\nAnd this is the reason “why we arranged an agreement between the present owner and all descendants of the Lieser family in accordance to the ‘Washington Principles,’” she said.\nKlimt’s portraits of women “are seldom offered at auctions,” the press release stated. It continued: “A painting of such rarity, artistic significance, and value has not been available on the art market in Central Europe for decades.”\n",

Researchers removed germ cells in both females and males to compare the biological responses.\nIn female killifish, \"germ cell removal shortened lifespan, decreased estrogen, and increased insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling,\" the study said. In contrast, germ cell removal in males improved their health with increased vitamin D signaling, resulting in increased longevity.\nRead more: Find the Right Tax-Advantaged Health Savings Account\nDr. Michael Holick, a specialist in vitamin D research at Boston University's Vitamin D, Skin, and Bone Research Laboratory, explained the vitamin D process to Newsweek in a phone interview: \"When you make vitamin D in your skin from sun exposure or you ingest it, it goes to your liver and its converted to 25-hydroxy vitamin D, but then it goes to your kidney where it gets activated to the 125-dihydroxy vitamin D—that is the active form of vitamin D that causes signaling by interacting with the vitamin D receptor that is then going to the nucleus to unlock genetic information.\" Vitamin D \"by itself is inactive, it has to get activated first in the liver and then the kidney,\" he explained.\nHe found the recent study's findings to be unsurprising, as the beneficial effects and connection to increased longevity of vitamin D are \"well documented.\" He noted a previous study of worms (C. elegans) that showed they lived longer when given vitamin D \"because it improved the protein status of the animal.\" In addition, he highlighted that the latest Endocrine Society's vitamin D recommendations state, \"In the general population ages 75 years and older, we suggest empiric vitamin D supplementation because of the potential to lower the risk of mortality.\"\nDr. Holick added, \"There's very good documentation that the higher your vitamin D status, the lower is your risk for mortality. And I believe that is for all ages.\" He emphasized that vitamin D can improve neurocognitive function, reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and type 2 diabetes, and lower the risk of autoimmune disorders.\n\"We know that when you make vitamin D in your skin from sunlight, it lasts two to three times longer in your body than when you take it as an oral dose,\" Dr. Holick said. \"But if you take vitamin D every day, it's not an issue. But sunlight, we believe not only makes vitamin D in your skin, but has a lot of other potentially important effects.\" He recommends \"sensible sun exposure.\"\nNewsweek reached out to several medical researchers for comment via email on Thursday.\n",

Or this year might yet prove to be Ukraine's dark night before the dawn.\nDuring a recent visit to Ukraine, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg urged allies to fulfill their military aid commitments to Kyiv and declared: \"It's not too late for Ukraine to prevail.\"\nRussia's grinding westward push is continuing all along the eastern front, with Moscow's troops straining at great cost to seize new territory in the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia regions. The total capture of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts has been a key Kremlin goal since it fomented rebellion in eastern Ukraine in 2014, and a decade on the ambition appears in reach.\nThe current plodding offensive is laying the groundwork for an expected fresh summer campaign. Among the potential targets of the new push are the Donetsk city of Chasiv Yar—which is already on the front line and may even fall before summer—and the Kharkiv city of Kupiansk, a vital gateway to Ukraine's second city of Kharkiv.\nThe Institute for the Study of War wrote this week that Russia's capture and stabilization of a salient northwest of Avdiivka \"presents the Russian command with a choice of either continuing to push west towards its reported operational objective in Pokrovsk or trying to drive northward to conduct possible complementary offensive operations with the Russian effort around Chasiv Yar.\"\nNewsweek has contacted the Russian Defense Ministry by email to request comment.\nChasiv Yar is only six miles east of Bakhmut, which has long been a hotspot on the Donetsk front, even after its fall to Russian forces in May 2023. Now abandoned by almost all of its prewar residents, the city was a vital staging point for Ukrainian forces and sits on a hill with commanding views over the surrounding area.\nIt is also a gateway to the cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, both strategic level objectives for Moscow's forces in their bid to capture all of the Donetsk region.\nKyiv focused significant resources in Chasiv Yar after Moscow fomented rebellion in the Donbas in 2014, making it home to an important military hospital and later the headquarters for the Joint Forces Operation against Russia and its local proxies.\nPokrovsk is around 26 miles northwest of Avdiivka at the junction of two major roads heading to the city of Donetsk and to Bakhmut, as well as a railway heading through Avdiivka. A successful drive all the way to Pokrovsk would expose the southern flanks of Chasiv Yar, Kramatorsk and Slovyansk.\nPavel Luzin, a Russian military analyst and visiting scholar at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, told Newsweek it is \"hard to say\" whether Moscow's forces will be able to scale up their current drive for a larger summer push.\n\"There are not too many resources for a bigger offensive,\" Luzin said. \"Also, almost all these expectations are inspired by Moscow itself.\n\"What we do see is that Russia was trying to surround a significant group of the Ukrainian forces in Avdiivka, exactly like in Ilovaisk in August 2014 and in Debaltsevo in February 2015, but was incapable of doing this. Perhaps, Russia will make another attempt in the same way, because it needs stronger positions in order to get a break in the war.\"\nThis break, Luzin added, would allow the Kremlin to rest and reinforce its mauled forces. Leaders in Kyiv have repeatedly warned that Moscow is only interested in a temporary ceasefire to this end, not in a lasting peace. Luzin concurred.\n\"They need a break, but they are not going to end the war,\" he said.\nPutin may hope to win space for a pause having won all of Donetsk and Luhansk, long at the center of his project to dismantle Ukrainian sovereignty.\n\"For today, they want to get at least Donetsk and Luhansk,\" Luzin said. \"The problem is that the Kremlin claims Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions as Russia territory as well.\"\nWhile Ukraine digs in, Kyiv will also be looking to disrupt Russian communications, logistics, and industry as much as possible. Long-range drone strikes on targets inside Russia have become commonplace, and Ukraine shows little sign of easing its attacks even in the face of American displeasure.\nThe arrival of the longest-range iteration of the American ATACMS—the MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System—will give Kyiv greater reach than ever before. The longest-range munition can hit targets out to 186 miles, almost double that of shorter range ATACMS munition first provided in late 2023. Among its possible targets is the logistically arterial and symbolically powerful Kerch Strait Bridge.\nBut as with all new weapons, Kyiv has a closing window in which to exploit the ATACMS.\n\"As we know, the Russians are able to adapt in a very short period of time,\" Ivan Stupak, a former officer in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and now an adviser to the Ukrainian parliament's national security, defense and intelligence committee, told Newsweek.\n\"I think we have up to two months to eliminate as many Russian war objects as is possible before the Russians will adapt,\" Stupak added.\nThis year may see a significant shift in air power, with Ukraine awaiting the delivery of dozens of American-made F-16 fighter jets. Kyiv has said the aircraft will boost its defense against cruise missiles and drones being launched at cities nationwide, and also give much needed relief for front line troops being bombarded by Russian airstrikes.\nMoscow's glide bombs have been pivotal in the first part of 2024, allowing its aircraft to drop massive munitions on Ukrainian positions from a relatively safe distance. F-16s will make front line areas more dangerous for Russian pilots, given Ukraine expects to be using air-to-air missiles with ranges of up to 310 miles.\nWhile Ukraine has been waiting for F-16s, Russia has been losing planes. Recent months have seen an uptick in reported Russian aircraft being downed, including far behind the front line. Those losses—and the subsequent added strain placed on surviving planes—may prove challenging for the Russian air force in the aerial battles to come.\nStill, leaders in Kyiv and some allies abroad have repeatedly warned that a drip-fed and small force of F-16s will do little to change the overall picture. It remains to be seen if Western powers can master the logistical and political challenges to deliver a large number of the jets in a manner that can give Ukraine a battlefield edge.\nBut the newly arriving aircraft will help bolster a Ukrainian air force whittled down by two years of war. Kyiv's pilots survived Russia's initial onslaught despite the vast numerical superiority of the invaders. Ukrainian airmen performed far beyond expectations, inflicting serious losses on their Russian counterparts and making large areas of Ukraine too dangerous for Moscow's aircraft.\nThe naval asymmetric cat-and-mouse game will likely continue. Kyiv's drones and cruise missiles have proven deeply problematic for the Black Sea Fleet. The force has adapted its tactics and defenses to some degree, but new iterations of Ukrainian long-range weapons will continue to pose a potent littoral threat.\nThat threat has already forced Moscow to withdraw its most high-value naval assets from occupied Crimea, the traditional home of the Black Sea Fleet and the nexus of power projection in the region and into the Mediterranean Sea. Kyiv is constantly developing its naval drones and is expected to continue strike efforts even deep into Russian waters.\nUkraine has no significant conventional navy of its own, though leaders in Kyiv have long been working with Western partners to secure new vessels, including armored riverine boats from the U.S.\nThese small ships will not be able to challenge the Black Sea Fleet, a job which will remain assigned to the asymmetric drone fleet that has proven so successful. Ukraine will spend the rest of 2024 hoping to twist the knife and exacerbate Russia's problems at sea.\n",

    "content": "As evidenced by recent communications from the SEC, corporate boards are increasingly being made to bear ultimate responsibility when it comes to cybersecurity; while the management of cybersecurity risk is the responsibility of CEOs — who normally delegate much of the day-to-day management to a CISO or the like — the oversight of that management is the responsibility of directors.\nYet, despite what seems to be a decades-long barrage of daily news reports of cyberattacks wreaking havoc, when it comes to overseeing the mitigation of cyber risk, corporate boards often fail to perform as needed and intended. It is not hard to understand why such a problem exists; cybersecurity is a relative newcomer to the list of major risks that businesses face, and cyber risks evolve far faster than do other \"classic\" forms of risk, such as those related to accounting, legal, or physical dangers. The business world has far less relevant collective experience managing cyber risk than it does most other forms of risks — and there is even less wisdom that we can leverage from prior generations when it comes to actually overseeing the management of such risks.\nBoards, of course, do not ignore cybersecurity — to the contrary, today's directors are, generally speaking, both well aware of the importance of cybersecurity and highly committed to ensuring that their respective management teams properly mitigate against cyber risk. Boards regularly not only pay homage to cyber risk but back up their lip service by encouraging senior management to allocate steadily increasing budgets for defense against it.\nBut, as the saying goes, \"the road to hell is paved with good intentions\"; while boards certainly want to do what they are supposed to in order to oversee the management of cyber risk, the sad reality is that boards of directors often fail to achieve their mission in this regard, primarily because many boards simply do not have members with sufficient enough relevant knowledge, experience, and skills to understand how to meaningfully fulfill the board's role vis-à-vis cybersecurity. Such a phenomenon also creates a danger; in some cases, ill-conceived board actions can even harm organizational cybersecurity rather than help to improve it.\nIn some cases, boards lacking adequate representation of people with appropriate cybersecurity-related backgrounds can go for long periods of time without appearing to suffer from any problems from the deficiency. In fact, entities with such boards may even boast of having made great investments in information-security programs; eventually, however, after some form of cybersecurity \"incident\" occurs, the false sense of security quickly erodes, the investments are revealed to have been made in a far from optimal fashion, and the barrier to cyberattacks that many thought was the virtual equivalent of the walls of a fort is discovered to appear to be closer in nature to that of Swiss cheese.\nSometimes, cybersecurity-related discussions in boardrooms seem to offer great promise but are, in reality, unproductive sessions in which directors attempt to perform part of the job of the CISO instead of focusing on their responsibility to oversee the CISO's management of cyber risk. Sometimes, important issues may be raised, but, because directors believe that they understand the matter under discussion better than they actually do, they don't realize that important issues remain unresolved. On other occasions, there isn't enough experience in the room to understand the matter under discussion; I am even aware of a board meeting in which a director joked that he needed a translator in order to understand a presentation by the CISO.\nAs fiduciaries, boards are tasked with ensuring that their respective management teams have implemented proper plans to ensure that their respective businesses are adequately resilient in the event of cyberattacks (which are, over time, inevitable) and that any remaining exposures are limited to known, acceptable, and manageable risk levels. As a result, cybersecurity risk is becoming a staple of internal audit functions. Yet, because cybersecurity is a relatively new discipline, many organizations plan and measure cybersecurity-related matters using KPIs that may sound to accountants and lawyers as if they were appropriate and effective criteria for measuring success, but which are, in fact, improperly selected and severely flawed.\nBoard members often hear, and accept at face value, reports of cybersecurity success based on criteria that are not only not meaningful, but often misleading. How many times have I heard of organizations that measured the number of breaches per quarter — without any knowledge of how many attacks were launched to begin with, without understanding the relative potential damage from the various compromises, and ignoring the fact that, by far, the most harmful breaches are likely to be the ones that have not been reported because they have not been detected?\nAlong that line, it is important to understand that boards are tasked to oversee risk — that is, ensuring that senior management has properly implemented appropriate risk management plans — not to perform actual risk management. Yet, when it comes to cyber risks, it is not uncommon to find directors dedicating considerable amounts of time to discussing cybersecurity matters that should be handled by the CISO and remain outside of their areas of focus, while, simultaneously, failing to discuss key elements of what they actually do need to cover.\nI have seen board meetings get sidetracked when directors unnecessarily involved themselves in a detailed discussion about the results of a recent company-wide phishing simulation; instead of focusing their attention on how well the company could withstand a phishing attack — or any form of cyberattack — the folks in charge of overseeing the management of cyber risk expended considerable time and energy on speculating why the employees of particular departments outperformed their counterparts vis-à-vis not falling prey to spoofed emails. The board needs to understand how well the company can withstand the damage of an attack — not whether it is 27% or 28% of employees who need to take a training class.\nIn short, it is of critical importance for boards to ensure that they have members with cybersecurity experience — but time should be taken to ensure that it is the right type of cybersecurity experience; simply adding someone to a board because they worked in the cybersecurity field can lead to problematic circumstances, and ultimately, nasty surprises.\n",

    "content": "Today, news media faces a number of structural challenges: deepening polarization, diminishing trust and a stark decline in reader engagement.\nAt Newsweek, we've delved deeply into the forces driving us here. One way we're addressing these concerns is the Fairness Meter, which allows readers to hold us accountable by rating an article's fairness on a five-way scale. Our fairness meter can be found at the bottom of select articles across Newsweek's editorial content and will help maintain a high standard of integrity, transparency, and accountability.\nThe landscape of polarization and eroding trust\nMedia's increasing polarization owes much to the dominance of social media, but the challenges began even before that with the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987.\nThis policy, which mandated the inclusion of diverse viewpoints, once ensured a breadth of perspectives in broadcast journalism — a formal balance that lent fairness and credibility to the format. Its removal marked the first shift toward what we see today: more extreme and polarized media narratives. Gallup's polls from 2021 and 2022 show that only 34% of Americans trust mass media, with a pronounced partisan divide — 70% of Democrats versus a mere 14% of Republicans trust mass media outlets.\nThis erosion of trust in news media is not an isolated phenomenon. It's part of a broader moment in which public confidence in many institutions has been waning. In an age when misinformation can spread rapidly over social media, the role of responsible media in providing accurate and unbiased information has become more important than ever. We must do what we can to restore this trust, and it begins at the core of the news product.\nChanging dynamics of reader participation\nParallel to the issue of trust is the evolution of reader participation. The digital age has transformed how audiences interact with news content.\nPost-2016 trends indicate a decline in engagement with traditional news outlets, particularly among younger demographics. Young people increasingly bypass traditional news platforms, turning instead to social media feeds and other digital channels for their news and information.\nThis shift has significant implications for how news organizations engage with their audiences and maintain relevance in the digital era.\nThe Fairness Meter\nNewsweek's Fairness Meter is one of our responses. First, it represents a commitment to deepening trust and enhancing reader engagement by involving our audience in the direct evaluation of our content. Second, the tool redefines the more traditional comment-based systems, instead opting for a structured and consistent way for readers to express their views on the fairness of our articles, providing a concrete method for readers to help shape and sharpen our journalistic tenets.\nHere's some of what we've learned after placing the Fairness Meter on over 1,000 stories since it was activated in September 2023.\nThe aspirations of the Fairness Meter aim to go beyond just gauging perceptions of fairness. It's one step in the direction of restoring trust in the relationship between the public and the news media.\nRepatriating news engagement to the news property\nOver time, social media has usurped news organizations as the forum for discussion and debate of news and current events. One byproduct has been the formation of information echo chambers, which often come to confirm the existing biases of different groupings of users. Social platforms — with finely tuned algorithms designed to amplify engagement — frequently prioritize sensational and controversial content, perspectives and comments, fueling what could be referred to as \"enragement engagement.\"\nThis shift has effectively taken over much of the discourse that was once a feature of news platforms. The Fairness Meter is an initiative to bring back reader engagement to the news platform itself.\nThe end of the ivory tower: A call for public accountability\nThe modern media landscape needs a fundamental shift in how news outlets address reader perceptions and engagement. The era of the journalistic \"ivory tower\" — where media outlets operate in isolation from their audience — is over. Today's media must open itself up to public accountability. The Fairness Meter is one way of demonstrating this new approach, allowing readers to actively participate in shaping the stories our journalists report on.\nIgnoring the imperative for engagement and transparency comes with significant risks. The decline in public trust and reader engagement on news platforms is a clear signal. This growing distrust, exacerbated by digital echo chambers and social media-fueled confirmation biases, threatens the foundation of credible journalism.\nThe Fairness Meter is not merely a feedback tool; it fosters dialogue and understanding and demonstrates respect for our audience's intelligence, acknowledging their critical role in shaping the way that we in the media work.\nOriginally published on Poynter.org\n",

    "content": "In the winter of 1969, during the frigid spring semester at the University of Minnesota, a coalition of Black students staged a sit-in protest at Morrill Hall, occupying the office of the bursar and records for almost twenty-four hours.\nLed by Afro-American Action Committee (AAAC) President Rosemary Freeman, a sophomore, and one of only eighty-seven Black students on a campus of 40,000, the organization had communicated their grievances and demands for institutional changes several times previously.\nFreeman was originally from Browning, Mississippi, an all-Black community created by a group of ex-slaves shortly after the Civil War. She first came to activism as a high school student working to register Black voters in the south under Martin Luther King Jr. She'd been previously jailed for her participation in voter registration and was therefore no stranger to contentious political situations.\nThe assassinations of Dr. King and then Robert Kennedy in 1968 intensified the AAAC's desire to call the university to action. Among other things, they wanted the institution to foster diversity on campus via scholarships for local Black high school students and the creation of an African American Studies department.\nUniversity of Minnesota President Malcolm Moos, previously radio silent in response to the committee's outreach, negotiated a common ground to end the protest by the deadline. And thanks to the action of the AAAC, an African American Studies department was created and the university opened its doors more readily to local Black talent.\nIn February 2019, the University's Department of African American and African Studies celebrated the fiftieth reunion of the protest with teach-ins at the student union, the first time for a public reckoning of the events of 1969.\nRosemary Freeman, along with John Wright, Horace Huntley, and Warren Tucker Jr., are rarely known. As the AAAC president and, as she tells it, the one who leveled the playing field between herself and President Moos by greeting him in his own office chair during negotiations, Freeman's involvement is often glossed over in the scant number of available retellings.\nWhen I started my doctoral work in the sociology department at the University of Minnesota almost exactly forty years after the Morrill Hall Takeover (as it has come to be known), I'd never heard the story, nor did I understand the legacy of Freeman's leadership.\nWhich stories get told impact who is able to feel empowered by them. The erasure of Black women's stories weakens our understanding and connection to the legacy of Black women's accomplishments and dims the possibility of our collective strength.\nFifteen years before the Morrill Hall Takeover, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), working with Black families around the country, brought local lawsuits against counties across the South after being blocked from enrolling their children, mostly Black girls, into segregated white schools, culminating in the landmark Supreme Court case that legalized educational desegregation.\nThe stories of coordinated legal action are rarely heard, silencing the voices of all those other families who sacrificed themselves for the integration fight but whose names are absent from historical narratives on the issue.\nBrown v. Board of Education has been watered down to focus on one little girl, Linda Brown, wiping away what was actually a long-term, strategic plan between the NAACP, more than a dozen families, and the students themselves. This organized erasure of complex political protests organized in Black communities maintains perceptions of our ineptness in political organizing.\nIt is not a coincidence that girls and women (often mothers and teachers) led the fight for school desegregation. Black girls learn early in life that they will be expected to be poised and strong-willed in the face of danger and degradation.\nThe girls on the front lines of desegregation were physically and psychologically attacked, ignored, or otherwise pushed to their limits at school. In response, their voices were their weapons.\nThey utilized silence when deliberately provoked and spoke up in classes where teachers ignored their signals to participate voluntarily. They endured, sure, but they also made waves.\nSo much of the work of political organizing and protest has been concentrated among Black girls, in schools. But to highlight our skills of organization and execution of activism is to magnify our strengths, so the strategy and forethought of Black activism must be repackaged as insignificant or nonexistent. I didn't know my own connections to the desegregation movement until recently, which is perhaps to say I didn't know my strength.\nThree years after the Brown v. Board of Education decision, The Little Rock Nine, nine Black students—six girls and three boys—enrolled at the all-white Little Rock Central High School just a few blocks from where my mother lived with her family in Arkansas.\nJust a toddler at the time, my mother and her siblings were often under the care of fifteen-year-old, Carlotta (Walls) LaNier, the youngest of the Little Rock Nine attempting to integrate the local high school and the first Black woman to graduate from Little Rock Central High School.\nCarlotta was my family's regular babysitter; she was also on the front lines of American desegregation. She, along with her eight classmates, withstood the racial slurs and threats of physical violence in the name of education. She also paid a heavy price.\nAfter her graduation, the Walls family was forced to relocate to Colorado to find work and avoid the backlash caused by Carlotta's participation in the equal education fight. Ms. LaNier was a woman I'd never heard directly linked to my family until recently, when I made the decision to uncover her story as a part of ours.\nHistory, as a discipline and a social construct, does not view women, especially Black women, as historical actors. Despite our accomplishments, what we do is not often chronicled as \"real\" history. This is as true at Vassar as at any other HWSCU. In 1969 and again in 1990, Black students protested on campus and occupied buildings to demand fair treatment and increased support structures for Black students.\nIn 1969, thirty-four Black women undergrads took over the main building in the early morning hours, a result of detailed tactical planning, which allowed them to take over the switchboard with relative ease. They remained for three days until then President Alan Simpson responded to their demands.\nIn February 1990, a group of Black students again staged a sit-in at the main building, this time to protest the hiring of Daniel Patrick Moynihan—a white Republican sociologist infamous for his racist theories about the status of Black communities—as a distinguished lecturer at the college.\nMoynihan quit his post as a result of the protests. Recollection of the events is captured in the Vassar Encyclopedia, but you won't hear discussions of their organization on campus or about the improvements made as a result of their efforts.\nThere aren't photos capturing their occupation of Main Hall hung alongside those pictures of almost two hundred years of white students that serve as a visual history of the place. There are no anniversary celebrations or well-kept archives of what these students were fighting against or what they achieved. Their stories are functionally lost from the general history of the college.\nBlack students continue standing on the front lines of protests against police brutality and racism on college campuses across the country. They are being jailed, threatened, and vilified but also ignored in favor of the mainstream appeal of white student activists when the topic is appropriately \"non-racial.\"\nOn college campuses, Black students are challenging their \"othered\" status in ways I never thought possible. Conservatives often perpetuate the false narrative that colleges are places where hyper-liberal professors hijack students' minds with impractical, politically correct ideals. In reality, my students, mostly Black women, come to me not initially looking to protest.\nThey want to belong, to be the proverbial Vassar girls their white counterparts are offered the chance to become. And they are frustrated that the promises of higher education don't seem to apply to them.\nWe are not so different, my students and me. Protest is a last resort, a desperate act from groups of people without access to conventional support, but also with limited information about the activism of their forbearers.\nThese Black women want an education free from all the trappings of white supremacy that limit their potential. I didn't protest when I probably should've. I didn't recognize my connections to Black women activists and disruptors of the past, but they were there to be heard. And so, I try to pass down these stories, as bits of wisdom from the ancestors, that I wish I'd had.\nThis is an adapted excerpt from Black Women, Ivory Tower: Revealing the Lies of White Supremacy in American Education (Broadleaf Books, 2024).

    "content": "Newsweek's core mission is to provide our readers with a deep and nuanced understanding of the world around them. That means embracing a truly global perspective. We aim to transcend surface-level narratives, offering coverage that creates opportunities for true international dialogue.\nTo many, the 21st century is also known as the Asian Century. Asia will lead the world in this next phase of global economic growth. According to Goldman Sachs, by 2050, the world's GDP will be $227.9 trillion. Asia will represent the largest share of global GDP growth at $90.6 trillion, followed by the developed economies at $82.9 trillion and then the rest of the world.\nOur recent exclusive interviews with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, masterfully conducted by our team led by Global Editor-in-Chief Nancy Cooper, are the latest example of this commitment. In this context, I see our role at Newsweek as not merely passive observers but as active facilitators of meaningful dialogue around the future of Asia.\nAs an American who was born and lived the early part of my life in India, I have a nuanced perspective on India's challenges and aspirations. The country's relatively nascent sovereignty, having emerged only 75 years ago from centuries of colonial rule, is a testament to its resilience. The journey from its colonial past to a vibrant democracy is a narrative I hold close to my heart, and it drives my commitment to ensure that Newsweek covers India with the depth and nuance it deserves.\nCoverage of India by mainstream international media at times gravitates toward simplistic narratives that fail to capture the profound complexity and vibrant diversity of the world's most populous nation. Typically, the portrayal emphasizes either the booming IT and economic sectors or the persistent challenges such as poverty and social friction, leaving little room for the varied perspectives beyond and in between.\nSuch coverage can overlook the rich cultural tapestry, the internal innovations in various sectors, and the distinct political dynamics, all shaped by thousands of years of history, that today stand at the nexus of geopolitical change. The level of optimism and pride I'm seeing among Indians—friends, family, and colleagues—is truly inspiring and unlike anything I've experienced before. The global stage is set to witness a confident India, and if the Indian diaspora's contribution to the U.S., the UK, and elsewhere is a preview, the world stands to gain much from India's rising prominence.\nThat's why Newsweek's interview with Prime Minister Modi and the associated story was not just a recitation of current events: Our coverage delved into the complex dynamics of India's geopolitical relationships and their broader implications for global affairs.\nModi's remarks to Newsweek on the Indo-China border disputes and his call for urgent resolution resonated globally, sparking reactions from major geopolitical players, including a direct response from the Chinese government. The response was immediate and extensive, with major news outlets like Bloomberg and BBC amplifying the discussion. The reaction from China was particularly significant, and its Foreign Ministry spokesperson highlighted hopes for diplomatic progress. This international engagement underscores the relevance of Newsweek's efforts and reaffirms our role in fostering meaningful global dialogue.\nA few weeks after our interview with Prime Minister Modi, we met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo. There, too, we gained fresh insights into the thoughts of a significant national leader and his approach to his country's challenges and opportunities.\nThe interview explored the country's pressing need for stronger partnerships with the U.S. and other regional allies to address what he described as \"the most challenging and complex security environment since the end of World War II,\" a situation exacerbated by recent military activities by China and North Korea. Throughout the interview, he frequently emphasized the term \"peace,\" underscoring Japan's intent to be assertive yet remain a peace-loving nation, obeying international rules.\nIt's our view that building a successful digital media company with global relevance today involves understanding political, economic, and social dynamics and committing to comprehensive reporting that resonates at the global stage and captures the evolution of the global order. In that respect, our recent India and Japan coverage serves as a kind of blueprint for Newsweek's global future. The impact of our interviews with Prime Minister Modi and Prime Minister Kishida and the accompanying stories highlights the critical role of media in international relations and democracy, reinforcing our commitment to journalism that not only reports but also enlightens.\n",

    "content": "General Hospital actor Johnny Wactor was shot to death Saturday morning outside of a downtown Los Angeles bar, and his killer is still on the loose five days later.\nWactor, 37, died from a gunshot wound to the chest, according to the County of Los Angeles Medical Examiner. The death has been ruled a homicide.\nLos Angeles Police Department told Newsweek there is no update on the case.\nBased on witness statements, Wactor had finished his shift as a bartender at Level 8 and was walking to his vehicle early Saturday, according to a press release from the Los Angeles Police Department.\nHe was confronted by three people \"who had Wactor's vehicle raised up with a floor jack and were in the process of stealing the catalytic converter,\" the press release states. \"Without provocation, the victim was shot by one of the individuals.\"\nPolice responded to a call for an \"assault with a deadly weapon-shooting\" around 3:25 a.m. to the 1200 block of Hope Street. Officers rendered aid to Wactor and requested emergency medical services.\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department transported Wactor to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\nWactor's brother, Grant Wactor, told PEOPLE that his brother had put his body in front of his female colleague who was also walking to the car and had put his hands up when he was shot.\n\"He did not confront them,\" Grant told PEOPLE. \"He did not try to stop them. He was just trying to diffuse the situation by stepping back.\"\nGrant believes the three men \"weren't expecting anybody to walk up on them.\"\n\"There's nothing more dangerous than a coward with a gun in his hand,\" Grant said.\nAnita Joy has spoken out on Instagram, saying she was \"with Johnny in his last moments.\"\n\"My heart is shattered with his loss but I believe I have gained the best guardian Angel out there,\" Joy wrote in her post. \"I love you Johnny Wacky.\"\nThe three suspects involved were wearing all dark clothing and driving a dark sedan, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.\nThe suspects fled northbound on Hope Street.\n\"These criminals need to be caught - Level 8 needs to provide parking for their late hour staff as they originally promised - This cannot be something that isn't responded to with action, it needs to be addressed in a manner to prevent anything like this ever happening again to the best of their ability - Level 8 needs to contribute to Johnny's family to honor and respect him for all the hard work and effort he did for them,\" Joy wrote.\nWactor was best known for his role as Brando Corbin in the beloved soap opera General Hospital. He also made appearances in NCIS, Westworld, The OA, Station 19, Agent X, Criminal Minds, and other shows and short films.\nHe had moved to Los Angeles to become an actor and made his television debut with Army Wives in 2007.\nHis brother said Wactor was an avid rock climber.\n\"He was a good person,\" Grant told PEOPLE about his brother. \"He was taken way too early, and no one should be taken like this at all. He touched a lot of people. He believed in his core values to the end, and he lived life to the fullest the way he wanted to. And he was happy doing that.\"\nA GoFundMe has been set up by Wactor's godmother, Michaelle Kinard. At the time of writing, over one thousand people have donated more than $97,000. The goal is to raise $200,000.\nComments on the page mention Wactor's talent and his \"imprint that will never be forgotten.\"\n\"Johnny was the kindest soul. My heart is utterly broken and somehow we NEED justice for Johnny!\" Kinard wrote on the page. \"I want to raise money for his mother, Scarlett, and his brothers, Lance and Grant to be able to travel the distance of 2000 miles (the many times it may take) to take care of this heartbreaking business which they have been sentenced.\"\nExcess donation will be given to charities of the family's choosing in Wactor's memory, according to Kinard.\nThe Central Bureau Homicide is investigating Wactor's case and is requesting the public's help.\nAnyone with information regarding this case is urged to call Detectives Gonzales or Martinez, Los Angeles Police Department, Central Bureau Homicide, at 213-996-4142.

    "content": "Nine hours and 30 minutes ahead of New York. Five hours and 30 minutes ahead of London. Three hours and 30 minutes behind Tokyo.\nFor more than a century, India’s clocks have officially fallen short of the full hour in calculating any time difference it has with most countries.\nAnd while it is part of a small group of nations and territories that shares that 30-minute gap - including Iran, Myanmar and parts of Australia - India is perhaps the most unlikely outlier.\nThe huge South Asian nation geographically spans what would normally be two time zones, but much to the frustration of some groups, it clings to its unusual clock settings, refusing to part ways with a system that has a very complicated past.\nIndia’s half-hour zone dates back to colonial rule of India and the era when ever-faster steamships and trains were shrinking the world.\nUntil the 19th century, India - like most places around the world - operated on very localized times, which were often different not just from city to city, but from village to village. But playing a key role in the background was East India Company, a ruthless and powerful British-owned trading organization that gradually seized control of large parts of the subcontinent.\nThe East India Company was managing the one of Asia’s first observatories, in Madras (now known as Chennai) by 1792. A decade later, the first official astronomer at this observatory declared Madras time to be “the basis of Indian Standard Time.”\nIt took a few decades, the advent of steam-powered locomotives and the commercial interests of the East India Company to make that stick, though.\n“The railroads had immense sway over the colonial powers,” says Geoff Gordon, a senior researcher in public international law at the University of Amsterdam.\n“Before the railroads won the contest for Madras time, there was a contest among the powerful cities – Bombay, Kolkata,” adds Gordon. “That fight didn’t last long.”\nMeanwhile, similar debates around the world, driven by the need to better coordinate transcontinental rail travel and improve maritime navigation, led to the establishment of the first international time zones at a conference in Washington D.C. in 1884.\nThe zones were based around the Greenwich Meridian, a line of longitude that runs north-south through the Greenwich Observatory in London. Time zones to the east of the Meridian are typically later than Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) in hourly increments.\nIt took a while for the system to be adopted globally. In India, people were still arguing over Madras Time. Despite the time’s adoption by the country’s railways, it faced considerable opposition from workers and local communities unwilling to have rigid new timings imposed on them.\n“There’s less room to maneuver as your working rhythms are linked up no longer with your boss down the street, the church bell, and the 20 other people that you go to work with,” says Gordon. “But it’s now determined by the railroad that arrives once a day.”\nEventually, Madras Time was established nationwide by 1905, with only a few remaining holdouts.\nThe start of the 20th century saw some push from scientific associations to calibrate India’s time to GMT.\nThe Royal Society in London proposed two time zones for India, both in full-hour increments from GMT and one another: Six hours ahead of GMT for the east and five hours for the west of the country.\nThat recommendation was rejected by the colonial government, which opted for a unified time that sat squarely in the middle: five and a half hours ahead of GMT.\n“It strikes me as sort of typical of the colonial mindset,” says Gordon.\nAnd so, in 1906, India’s British rulers introduced what is now known as Indian Standard Time.\nWhile the 30-minute difference is a lingering remnant of India’s colonial past, some countries have changed their own time zones more recently.\nVenezuela’s former president Hugo Chávez set clocks back by half an hour in 2007 to give schoolchildren more daylight time, a move that was later reversed by current leader Nicolas Maduro.\nIn 2015, North Korea moved out of sync with South Korea by creating “Pyongyang Time,” putting the country eight and a half hours ahead of GMT instead of nine.\nIndia’s colonial-era time zone decision making, however, reflected a chorus of political, scientific and commercial voices both from within the government and outside of it, Gordon says.\nHe compares India during this period to “Brazil,” the 1985 dark dystopian sci-fi fantasy film directed by Terry Gilliam, or the comically complicated contraptions drawn by US cartoonist Rube Goldberg.\n“It’s just this unbelievably haphazard Rube Goldberg-esque construction, that is built up through lots of different inputs, lots of people acting opportunistically, lots of people acting naively,” he adds. “There was a lot of weirdness and wildness.”\nIndia’s single time-zone has been the subject of much debate over the years, with populations in the northeast demanding a separate time zone given how wide the country is.\nThough this problem isn’t unique to India: geographically, China is the third largest in the world and still only has one time zone, which a 2014 study argues is symbolic of the state’s centralized control over people’s everyday lives.\nIndia’s official timekeepers, the National Physical Laboratory, even called for two separate time zones on account of this issue, citing reports of India’s time “badly affecting” the lives of people in the northeast.\nIt proposed two time zones instead: five and a half hours ahead of GMT for one side of India, and six and a half hours for another, specifically what they’ve described as “extreme northeast regions,” including areas like Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.\n“Despite geographical differences—such as the sun rising and setting nearly two hours earlier in the northeast compared to Gujarat—both regions adhere to the same time-zone,” says Maulik Jagnani, an assistant professor of economics at Tufts University.\nJagnani published a widely cited paper in 2019 highlighting the impact of sunlight on natural circadian rhythms in India, with a focus on children.\n“This setup affects children’s sleep patterns […] children exposed to later sunsets go to bed later,” adds Jagnani. “Fixed school and work start times do not allow for corresponding adjustments in wake-up times, leading to reduced sleep and poorer educational outcomes.”\nThe NPL also recognized this issue, adding that the circadian rhythm’s impact on health and work efficiency, is tied to the “overall socio-economic development of the region.”\nHowever, it looks like India’s unusual time zone is here to stay. When the question of introducing two time zones was put to India’s parliament in 2019, a government committee rejected the concept over unspecified “strategic reasons.”\n",

    "content": "Summer is almost here, and you’re looking forward to that long-awaited vacation. You can even picture it: ﻿The sun is shining, the waves are rolling gently and you’re curling up with a book.\nPerhaps you’re diving into a steamy romance novel or losing yourself in a page-turning thriller. Maybe a work of romantasy is captivating you instead. Whatever your flavor of escapism, it’s likely that it could be classified as a “beach read” — that oft-dismissed, unofficial category of books that readers gravitate toward in the warmer months.\nBut what exactly constitutes a beach read? And where did that idea come from? Here’s what to know about the popular term.\nA beach read is, naturally, the sort of book one might read at the beach — or at a lake, a resort or another typical summer destination.\nThe books populating “beach read” round-ups from booksellers, publishers and periodicals generally fall into the category of commercial fiction, designed to lure in readers with their saturated covers and playful illustrations. They’re also almost always marketed to women.\nAmanda Bergeron, who acquires contemporary and historical book club fiction for Penguin Random House’s imprint Berkley, has published several authors whose books frequently appear on “beach read” lists: Carley Fortune, Jasmine Guillory and Emily Henry, to name a few. When looking for the next big summer read, Bergeron says she’s drawn to fast-paced stories with compelling characters. If it transports the reader to another location, all the better.\n“It’s something that you’re excited to spend time with and you can’t put down — something that you’re just so eager to get back to that it will go with you wherever you go, whether that’s the park, the pool, the couch, your yard or even the beach,” she says.\nSome books just scream summer, presenting an obvious opportunity to be marketed as a beach read, according to Bergeron. If it takes place in the summer, perhaps on an island or another breezy locale, there’s a good chance it could be a beach read. Sometimes, the “beach read” designation is so fitting that it announces itself in the title, like Fortune’s 2022 romance novel “Every Summer After,” Jenn McKinlay’s 2023 rom-com “Summer Reading” or Henry’s aptly named 2020 “Beach Read.”\nWhile the romance genre tends to dominate the “beach read” landscape, the label isn’t limited to romance, says Bergeron. A beach read can just as easily be a suspenseful thriller or a puzzle-box mystery novel — at least for Bergeron, it’s a book that readers will want to discuss with others and bring along with them on vacation.\nIn other words, a beach read doesn’t ask the reader to ponder the grim realities of the modern world or plunge into the depths of the human experience. Rather, it offers a break from the slog of daily life and the constant drumbeat of depressing news stories.\n“For God’s sake, I do not want to be challenged,” Celeste Ballard declared in a 2014 humor column for The New Yorker about how to pick a summer read. “No ‘hard’ literature that I have to slog through to discover a deep and twisted meaning.”\nEven though the “beach read” designation can go hand in hand with commercial success (books labeled as such frequently make bestseller lists), it’s also a loaded term.\nAuthor Jennifer Weiner, whose books are often categorized as beach reads, rejected the label for years before eventually embracing it — an internal conflict she examined in a 2020 essay for Goodreads.\n“It’s not hard to discern a whiff of Coppertone-scented sexism in the label,” she wrote. “Fast-paced, diverting books that are by or for men are called thrillers or mysteries or sometimes just plain old books, while the ladies get every kind of label, from chick lit to women’s fiction to upmarket women’s fiction to domestic fiction to, well, beach books.”\nBooks labeled as beach reads tend to emphasize plot and characters over elegant prose and heavier themes. To some, the implication is that the book is less serious or less worthy of one’s time.\nDakota Johnson, who launched a book club earlier this year, seemed to echo that assumption in an interview with Bustle: “Our book club is literary fiction. It’s not beach reads. It’s not silly,” she said.\nThough the term “beach read” is commonly associated with frothy romance novels, Bergeron says that notion can be reductive. Beach reads can absolutely be frivolous — sometimes, that’s exactly what you need — but some of the most celebrated beach reads of the past few years explore weightier topics all while delivering on the promise of fun.\nFor instance, Fortune’s 2023 bestseller “Meet Me at the Lake” depicted postpartum anxiety and the loss of a family member, while Kiley Reid’s buzzy 2019 debut “Such A Fun Age” dealt with race and privilege. “A Love Like the Sun,” a forthcoming novel from Riss M. Neilson, includes representation of chronic illness.\n“The fact that writers are able to do all that and offer readers an escape or a big heart hug is just really exciting,” Bergeron says.\nThe term “beach read” first appeared in literary periodicals around 1990, according to an article by the Los Angeles Public Library — though it’s unclear who coined it.\nThe concept of the summer read goes back much further, says Donna Harrington-Lueker, a professor of English and communications at Salve Regina University and author of Books for Idle Hours: Nineteenth-Century Publishing and the Rise of Summer Reading. Though now ingrained in our culture, the notion of summer reading was actually a 19th century invention of the publishing industry that sprung up in response to the creation of the summer vacation.\nSummer reading was initially a ritual enjoyed by rich men, who could afford to engage in leisure travel and unwind with poetry and literature, according to Harrington-Lueker. That changed in the mid-to-late 19th century as the US rapidly industrialized after the Civil War. The construction of railroads and grand hotels made summer vacations more accessible for the middle classes, giving rise to what Harrington-Lueker calls the “summer novel.”\nThe summer novel was specifically geared toward women, Harrington-Lueker explains. The books generally took place over the summer at a resort and tended to follow the rhythms of the season: There might be scenes anchored around a picnic or a fireworks display, with detailed descriptions of what the female characters were wearing. Typically, the books ended with the heroine getting engaged.\n“These become lessons in how you practice summer leisure, and they become very popular,” Harrington-Lueker says.\nThe proliferation of the summer novel also generated backlash from some religious leaders who considered them a temptation and devoid of morality. The Reverend T. De Witt Talmage notably declared in an 1876 sermon that “there is more pestiferous trash read among the intelligent classes in July and August than in all the other ten months of the year.”\n“Would it not be an awful thing for you to be struck with lightning some day when you had in your hand one of these paper-covered romances—the hero a Parisian roué, the heroine an unprincipled flirt … ?” he chided at the time.\nBut throughout the late 1800s, the publishing industry worked to counter such notions and present summer reading as something desirable, Harrington-Lueker says. Magazines such as The Atlantic Monthly or Harper’s ran advertisements with women clad in muslin dresses, novel in hand, while literary critics extolled the benefits of lighter reading.\n“The cakes and ale of literature have their legitimate time and place after the more solid intellectual dishes of the past season have been digested,” an 1887 editorial in the literary review Book Buyer reads.\nMuch like today, summer reads at the time were seen as an escape from the turmoil of the real world. One 1885 magazine column Harrington-Lueker encountered in her research called that summer’s novels “peculiarly trivial” and hypothesized that publishers were responding to the cholera epidemic, believing “that the general mind will be so far distraught by anxiety as to have no attention to spare for being critical.”\nAs publishers solidified the association between summer and light reading, some institutions promoted more serious reading during the season, Harrington-Lueker said.\nOne notable example is the Chautauqua movement, a late 19th and early 20th century educational program that sought to help Americans improve themselves through reading. From schools requiring students to read so-called classics in the summer to the anti-racist reading lists that were ubiquitous in 2020, the idea of summer as a time for personal enrichment persists today. Indeed, some people reach for heftier titles during vacation precisely because they finally have the time to dig into them.\n“Summer reading becomes a point where people automatically begin to think, ‘How should we be spending our summer? Should we be spending it with escapist fiction that’s going to renew us, that’s going to give us this time apart from a more difficult world? Or should we be using it to engage with topics of more consequence?’” Harrington-Lueker says.\nThat push and pull between reading as escapism and reading as enrichment has long been a part of American culture, Harrington-Lueker adds. In recent years, she says she’s observed that the titles appearing on summer reading lists from The New York Times, Oprah’s Book Club and other cultural tastemakers seem less escapist than they were in previous years.\nBut from Bergeron’s perspective, plenty of readers are still looking for a respite — and this year’s offerings (she name-checked Ashley Poston’s “A Novel Love Story,” Kirsty Greenwood’s “The Love of My Afterlife” and Tia Williams’ “A Love Song for Ricki Wilde”) give them plenty of opportunities to do so.\n“Readers want to be transported,” she says. “(When you think of an) escape often you think light, but I think it’s the ability to inhabit another world or another set of shoes and just spend time in those pages.”\nAt a time when the world feels uncertain and overwhelming, Bergeron says, the beach read beckons.\n",

    "content": "Pundits in the literary world have been bemoaning the decline of literary magazines for years. These complaints have only gotten louder since the pandemic, which has seen an even more visceral contraction of funding and infrastructure for these long-held vessels of literary import, especially in light of a world full of readers who are migrating toward digital formats.\nLiterary journals seem to be fragile entities these days, lacking in both financial support and staffing as educational budgets devoted to the arts dwindle. And their supposedly lower-brow cousins, popular genre fiction magazines like Asimov and The Dark, haven't necessarily been faring much better, with many suffering lack of support, whether that means diminished advertising or subscription revenues. In either case, the magazine market for short fiction writers is dramatically shrinking.\nLiterary publications of decades and even centuries past were patronized by the general public as opposed to just academic or high-brow readerships, and were one of the few means of escapist entertainment in existence before the advent of radio, TV, and films. Stories by the likes of Charles Dickens and Thomas Hardy in fact started off as serialized stories in popular magazine formats, launching the cliffhanger trope in order to entice the reader into buying the next issue. But as literary and genre-based magazines continue to vanish into the digital abyss, another format has been rising to fill the void and provide homes for short-form, printed fiction: The themed anthology.\nAnthologies seem to be making a comeback at small presses. Anthology submission \"calls\" spike in expectation of holidays like Halloween (horror and thriller-based tales) or Christmas (inspirational stories). I've seen sub-genres calling for everything from a revival of noir crime stories, like Devil's Party Press' Hard Boiled and Loaded with Sin, to stories based on song lyrics, to gory retellings starring public domain characters (The Horror Writers of America's upcoming members-only Scaring & Daring middle-grade anthology). Certain independent presses are making anthologies a repeat venture, like 18thWall Productions or Smart Rhino Publications.\nAnthologies seem to have a more viable business model than fiction-based magazines, since each can be done as a one-off project, as opposed to the continued overhead associated with a long-term magazine. Here are a few ways anthologies have advantages over the traditional magazine format:\nThe trend toward financing entertainment projects like films has begun trickling down to more grounded projects like themed anthologies — which, although burdened with initial printing costs, still typically have far lower budgetary requirements than cinematic investments.\nPlatforms like Kickstarter and GoFundMe are being used more frequently to launch themed literary projects. Ventures funded by individual public donations are not reliant on public funding for their survival — so they don't have to worry about their grants being cut.\nAlthough anthologies are cropping up as a mainstay for independent publishers, major publishing houseshave also backed anthology projects. Strategies for such projects include hiring a high-profilewriter in the genre in question as an editor, which not only lends cachet to the finished product but often makes it easier to recruit other high-caliber, name-brand authors to contribute to the piece.\nSuch projects typically also leave slots for up-and-coming storytellers, recruited through more broad submission calls, providing the opportunity for lesser-known authors to be associated with established professionals in their genre. For example, the relaunched Weird Tales magazine recently published the 100 Years of Weird anthology, featuring classic pieces previously featured in the magazine, from \"the giants of speculative fiction\" such as R. L. Stine, Ray Bradbury, H. P. Lovecraft, and Isaac Asimov, mixed with some more contemporaries in the genre.\nAlthough the prestige of appearing in a literary magazine like The Paris Review will hardly be replaced, reading for the pleasure and adventure of it all (as opposed to for more high-brow purposes) has its value. It's also often more marketable — and at least somewhat more lucrative. Let's face it — more people go out of their way to purchase and read genre fiction.\nAnthologies tend to take a less academic and more entertaining, pop-culture approach to collections, drawing on a high-quality talent pool that reaches far beyond the finite world of literary fiction. A more mainstream approach to literature also tends to promote a broader range of thought, as opposed to the similitude that tends to pervade many academic environments of late.\nAcademia also leans toward avoiding a host of topics that this echelon has deemed triggering, which veers toward the suppression of concepts that still need to be discussed and aired within our society. Or at least, within the safe outlet of our entertainment.\nDepending on the business model, anthologies can be self-sustaining projects. These projects often require submission fees from authors in order to cover basic costs for professional cover designs and basic printing fees.\nYet as platforms like Amazon and IngramSpark evolve, the world of print-on-demand book production has shifted the upfront costs away from independent publishers and authors. Posting a book for sale on either of those platforms is free for independent authors, and author costs for print copies are minimal.\nSo, although the slow deterioration of literary and fiction-bearing publications is a sad state of affairs, it's true that nature abhors a vacuum — and market voids tend to be filled one way or the other. The emergence of cleverly themed anthologies could be the saving grace of the short-form fiction world, whether they appear as recurring offerings from a roster of specialty publishers, or as a one-off labor of love from an individual editor, providing near-endless reading experiences for story lovers of all genres.\n",

    "content": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.\nA Chinese tech executive has ignited outrage in China with her fiery endorsement of toxic workplace culture, which eventually caused her to lose her own job.\nQu Jing, the former vice president and head of communications at Baidu, often dubbed China’s equivalent to Google, sparked a public relations crisis for the Chinese search engine after her controversial comments hit a raw nerve with young workers fed up with grueling hours and relentless pressure.\nIn a series of short videos posted last week on Douyin, China’s version of TikTok, Qu spoke about her devotion to her career, strict management style and unflagging demands on her direct reports.\nIn one video, she lashed out at an employee who refused to go on a 50-day business trip during the Covid-19 pandemic, when China imposed stringent travel restrictions and quarantines.\n“Why should I take my employee’s family into consideration? I’m not her mother-in-law,” Qu said. “I’m 10 years, 20 years older than you. I didn’t feel bitter about it or tired, even though I have two children. Who are you to tell me that your husband can’t stand it?”\nIn another clip, Qu shared her personal sacrifices as a working mother. She was working so hard that she forgot her elder son’s birthday and what grade her younger son was in at school. She said she didn’t regret it because she “chose to become a career woman.”\n“If you work in public relations, don’t expect weekends off,” she said in a third video. “Keep your phone on 24 hours a day, always ready to respond.”\nIn another video, she also threatened to retaliate against employees who complain about her, saying they wouldn’t get another job in the industry.\nThe American Psychological Association describes “toxic workplace” as an environment filled with infighting, intimidation and other affronts that harm productivity.\nFollowing the public outcry, Qu has lost her own job at Baidu (BIDU), a person familiar with the matter told CNN on condition of anonymity. CNN has also seen a screenshot of an internal personnel system that appears to confirm she no longer works at the company.\nBaidu did not immediately respond to a request for comment. By Thursday night, Qu had removed the title of “Baidu’s vice president” from her account on Douyin.\nQu had apologized earlier in the day and said her posts did not speak for Baidu.\nThe controversy soon became a trending topic on Douyin and Weibo, China’s X-like platform, dominating online discussions. Users criticized Qu for her aggressive and insensitive approach and accused her, and Baidu, of promoting a toxic workplace.\n“In her voice and in her tone, there’s deep indifference to and lack of empathy for the common plight of her colleagues,” said Ivy Yang, a China tech analyst and founder of consulting firm Wavelet Strategy.\n“A lot of what she said really struck a nerve, because people feel that in their own workplaces very often. The fact that she said it in a way that’s so direct and in your face, it just generated this kind of emotional response,” she said.\n“This is what the bosses are thinking, and she was merely saying it out aloud,” Yang added.\nChina’s young workers have increasingly spoken out against the culture of excessive overwork and extreme competitiveness that has come to dominate many industries, especially the tech sector.\nIn 2019, Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma drew intense criticism after endorsing the “996” trend, meaning working from 9am to 9pm six days a week, and calling it a “huge blessing.”\nYang called the backlash against Ma a “watershed moment” that led people to rethink the relationship between the workplace and themselves — a trend that has only intensified as the Chinese economy slows.\nChina’s economy grew stronger than expected at the start of this year, but problems — including a property crisis, declining foreign investment and tepid consumption — are piling up.\n“When companies demand complete loyalty, time and energy from their employees, employees feel there’s no reciprocity or reward for their sacrifice or contribution, especially when things are slowing down. That becomes the central conflict, and this conflict is also at the heart of the Baidu saga,” Yang added.\nAs public anger mounted, the videos posted on Qu’s personal Douyin account were taken down.\nAfter days of silence, Qu apologized on Thursday for “causing such a big storm” in a post on her personal account on WeChat, China’s most popular social media app.\n“I have carefully read all the opinions and comments from various platforms, and many criticisms are very pertinent. I deeply reflect on and humbly accept them,” Qu wrote.\nShe also sought to put distance between her remarks and Baidu, saying she had not sought approval beforehand and that they did not represent the company’s stance.\n“There were many inappropriate and unsuitable points made in the videos, which led to misunderstandings about the company’s values and culture, causing serious harm,” Qu wrote.\nA person familiar with the matter said Qu’s clips were part of her push to amplify Baidu’s voice on short video platforms, which have become an increasingly important channel for information dissemination in China.\nRelated article\nLabor Day isn’t the holiday it once was for China’s workers\nQu had asked all members of the PR team to create their personal accounts, according to the person, who requested anonymity.\n“The main purpose is to improve everyone’s ability to make short videos. Everyone can have different options over the content, and Cristina chose to speak about her personal experience,” said the person, referring to Qu’s English name.\nQu worked as a reporter for China’s state news agency Xinhua before switching to the PR industry. She joined Baidu in 2021 from Huawei, a Chinese tech giant known for its hard-charging “wolf culture,” where employees are expected to emulate wolves’ bloodthirsty nature, fearlessness and resilience.\nRen Zhengfei, the founder of Huawei, has previously said in interviews that its corporate culture was misunderstood. “Wolf culture,” he has said, meant “sensitivity, team spirit and resilience” and that the company didn’t have a “996 culture.”\nA former Baidu employee said Qu brought Huawei’s “aggressive” corporate culture with her to Baidu.\n“(She triggered) a pretty big culture shock. About 60% of the team left within months of her arrival,” the former employee told CNN on the condition of anonymity.\nThe PR team is expected to always be available, keep their phones on, reply to messages immediately and attend meetings at midnight and on weekends with short notice, the former employee said.\nQu also adopted the military-style language used in corporate management at Huawei, requiring the team to be “disciplined” and “able to win battles,” the former employee said.\nCNN has reached out to Huawei for comment.\nThis article has been updated with additional information.\n",

    "content": "There is something luxurious about putting on a face mask, or relaxing in the bath after a long day, but unfortunately many of the beauty habits that have the biggest impact of hygiene aren't quite as 'sexy'.\nIt is these 'unsexy' tips that make the biggest difference to our personal hygiene and self-care. Reddit users have been rushing to share their top tips after u/caffeinated_hardback asked the online beauty community to share the \"unsexy hygiene tips that make you sexier.\"\nWith a number of tips posted within the thread, Newsweek took five to Dr. Hannah Kopelman, dermatologist at Kopelman Aesthetic Surgery, New York City, who shared her opinion on some of the most-upvoted tips under the post.\n1. u/@NotMarciaBrady: Getting a cream with glycolic acid for my feet. Holy cow, they've never looked this good! I used to slather Vaseline and file at least weekly and that worked for the day, but this cream works for days and my feet are so smooth and don't have dead skin on them.\nThis tip is one Kopelman wished more knew about, as she said: \"Using a cream with glycolic acid for your feet is an excellent tip for achieving smoother, softer skin. Glycolic acid is an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) that helps to exfoliate the skin by breaking down dead skin cells and promoting cell turnover.\n\"This is much more effective than traditional methods, like filing or using Vaseline, which provide only temporary results. By incorporating glycolic acid into your foot-care routine, you're enabling deeper exfoliation, which can keep your feet smooth and free of dead skin for longer periods,\" Kopelman added.\n2. u/@_Dumbledork_: This might be obvious for other people, but I just found out that you should wash your teeth before washing your face, not after. I can't believe a decades worth of pimples on my chin could've been avoided if I just knew this sooner.\nThe same goes for washing your hair, better do it before washing your face, but that was already my routine although it wasn't any conscious decision.\nKopelman called this tip simple, but highly effective. She said: \"The rationale is that toothpaste residue can drip onto your skin and clog pores, potentially leading to breakouts, especially around the chin area. By brushing your teeth first, you ensure that any splashes or residue are washed away when you cleanse your face, reducing the risk of pimples.\n\"Similarly, washing your hair before your face follows the same principle; shampoo and conditioner can leave a residue that may cause skin issues if not rinsed off properly. Adopting this sequence in your routine can help maintain clearer skin,\" Kopelman added.\n3. u/@samalaur: A summer one for you: Wiping my butt and all areas in the bikini area with a salicylic acid and/or glycolic acid. Keeps the area smelling clean and prevents ingrown hairs if you wax or shave in that area. Don't buy the expensive exfoliants at the wax place, just buy a decent percentage acid at your local drugstore or Amazon.\nThis tip has arrived just in time for the summer months. Kopelman said: \"Wiping the bikini area with salicylic acid or glycolic acid is a great tip for maintaining hygiene and preventing ingrown hairs.\n\"Salicylic acid, a beta hydroxy acid (BHA), helps exfoliate the skin and keep pores clear, while glycolic acid, an AHA, assists in removing dead skin cells. These acids can help prevent ingrown hairs, which are common in areas subjected to waxing or shaving. Using these products can also keep the area smelling fresh,\" Kopelman added.\nIt is important not to rush straight in with harsh ingredients on this sensitive area. Kopelman said that \"it's important to choose products with suitable concentrations to avoid irritation, and always do a patch test first to ensure your skin tolerates these acids well.\"\n4. u/@gbtn: I change my pillowcase every day and have a rotation of 8+ silk pillowcases (1 for every day of the week plus 1 for wash day in different colors for easier tracking). My face and hair stay cleaner for longer than ever before!\nIt seems obvious that resting your face on a dirty pillow case can lead to acne and other flareups, but a surprising amount of people didn't know of the impact this has on your skin.\nKopelman said: \"Changing your pillowcase daily, especially to a silk one, is a fantastic hygiene tip that can significantly improve both skin and hair health. Silk pillowcases are gentler on the skin and hair, reducing friction that can cause irritation and breakage.\n\"Frequent changing prevents the buildup of oils, sweat, and bacteria that can contribute to acne and other skin issues. Maintaining a rotation of pillowcases ensures that you always have a clean one ready, making this a practical and beneficial routine for anyone looking to enhance their beauty regimen,\" Kopelman added.\n5. u/@luv_marachk: Instead of using a towel to dry the face after washing, I use soft tissues (and sometimes cotton pads) to prevent transferring bacteria onto the face because towels get so dirty, and you don't even realize it sometimes. This has prevented a lot of break outs for me.\nAnother tip that most won't have given a second thought to; using a dirty or used towel to dry your face can instantly undo all the good work of your skin-care products.\nKopelman said: \"Using soft tissues or cotton pads to dry your face instead of a towel is an excellent practice to prevent breakouts. Towels can harbor bacteria and other contaminants, even if they look clean.\n\"By using disposable tissues, you reduce the risk of transferring these impurities onto your freshly cleansed skin,\" Kopelman added. \"This small change can lead to noticeable improvements in skin clarity and texture. It's a particularly useful tip for those with sensitive or acne-prone skin, as it minimizes the risk of irritation and infection.\"\n",

    "content": "As the Federal Reserve opted against cutting interest rates and kept them consistent at 5.25 percent to 5.5 percent, Americans' saving accounts are growing at unprecedented levels.\nThe Fed has levied one of the highest interest rates in more than a decade as inflation remains stubborn. But one side effect of the rates is that Americans' bank account money is soaring in savings interest.\nRead more: Compare the Best High-Yield Savings Accounts to Grow Your Savings\nSavers last year made $315.4 billion in interest in their deposit accounts, which was a whopping four times the $78.7 billion Americans made in 2022, LendingTree found.\n\"It's the best time to be a saver in over 20 years,\" Alex Beene, financial literacy instructor at the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek. \"If you haven't been taking advantage of these higher interest rates for certain accounts, do so immediately. Every month you fail to do so could amount to many extra dollars not coming into your account.\"\nThe savings gains happened as the average interest rate on regular bank savings accounts is 0.5 percent. In some cases, at larger banks, it's as low as 0.01 percent.\nBut savers using high-yield savings accounts saw interest rates above 4 percent, with some reaching 5 percent to 5.5 percent. That could lead to an additional $500 on a savings account balance of $10,000 over the span of one year.\nRead more: Average Savings Account Rates\n\"I can't stress enough what a renaissance this has been for savers,\" Michael Ryan, finance expert and founder of michaelryanmoney.com, told Newsweek. \"We're finally getting a chance to grow our cash reserves at a meaningful clip without taking undue risk.\"\nBut there are, of course, several negatives with the high interest rates.\nAfter today's Fed announcement, Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride said Americans are no closer to knowing when interest rates will come down again, meaning credit card payments, mortgages and car payments could continue to remain out of reach for many.\n\"The timing of when the Federal Reserve begins to cut interest rates is up in the air and in an indefinite holding pattern,\" McBride said in a statement. \"Until we see renewed evidence that inflation is consistently easing, we're no closer to the Fed cutting rates.\"\nWhile the high interest rates are promising news to savers, those in debt need to prioritize paying off their loans now or risk seeing their payment amounts skyrocket far beyond what they initially owed.\n\"The mantra of 'higher for longer' interest rates is music to the ears of savers who will continue to enjoy inflation-beating returns on safe-haven savings accounts, money markets, and CDs for the foreseeable future,\" McBride said. \"For borrowers however, it dashes the hopes that interest rates will come down in a meaningful way any time soon.\"\nRead more: Average Money Market Account Rates\nKevin Thompson, finance expert and 9i Capital Group founder and CEO, said many Americans will continue to keep cash on the sidelines as yield rates stay healthy for money markets and other savings accounts. And, echoing McBride's sentiment, it's unclear how long this could last, due to what the Fed has consistently called \"sticky\" inflation.\nIn March, inflation had reached 3.5 percent compared to a year ago, which remains far above the 2 percent rate the Fed continues to want for the economy.\n\"The Fed will keep rates higher for longer and the expectation is that we \"may\" see one rate cut this year, if any,\" Thompson told Newsweek. \"So, do not expect rates to come down in the near term.\"\n",

    "content": "Melanie Lynskey has revealed her biggest \"challenge\" while filming Peacock's new historical drama The Tattooist of Auschwitz.\nThe Critics' Choice Award winner is known for playing complex female characters, such as Shauna in psychological horror Yellowjackets, or revolutionary leader Kathleen in zombie drama The Last of Us.\nHowever, Lynskey has taken on a tamer, but no less stimulating role in The Tattooist of Auschwitz. The 46 year old stars as Heather Morris, the author behind the book the six-episode series is based on.\n\"In a way, it's a relief to not be fighting zombies or eating anyone,\" Lynskey told Newsweek, referencing her recent TV roles. \"But you know it was hard in its own ways. It is its own kind of challenge.\"\nLynskey finds it \"fun\" to play complicated women, but the Emmy nominee said portraying a real person came with \"a lot of responsibility.\"\n\"I just [wanted] her to be happy,\" Lynskey said. \"I [wanted] her to feel represented, and feel like she was seeing herself without [me] doing an impersonation of her, which would be so weird.\"\nRead more: Best Affordable Streaming Services\nAlthough she described the process as a \"balancing act,\" Lynskey discovered she could relate to Morris's sudden success in midlife.\nThe Tattooist of Auschwitz was Morris's debut novel, based on her real-life conversations with Holocaust survivor Ludwig (Lale) Sokolov—portrayed by Oscar nominee Harvey Keitel and The Little Mermaid actor Jonah Hauer-King in the show.\nWhile tasked with tattooing identification numbers onto the arms of other prisoners, Sokolov fell in love with a woman named Gita (Anna Próchniak), with Morris documenting their years-long struggle to be together.\nThe 2018 novel became an international bestseller, with Lynskey following a similar career journey. She landed her first movie role aged 17, starring alongside Kate Winslet in Peter Jackson's 1994 drama Heavenly Creatures.\nHer performance was praised by critics, but while Winslet headed to Hollywood, Lynskey preferred low-budget indie projects. This ensured she produced work she was proud of, but meant that few people outside of the industry knew her name.\nMainstream film and TV shows often relegated Lynskey to small parts, such as Reese Witherspoon's childhood friend in Sweet Home Alabama or as Charlie Sheen's stalker neighbor Rose in the early 2000 sitcom Two and a Half Men.\nLynskey left the role after two seasons due to a fear of only being seen as the show's \"wacky neighbor,\" despite Rose being her steadiest acting job to date. At the time, her agent called her \"crazy\" for turning down a spot as a series regular.\nHowever, Yellowjackets changed the game, making Lynskey a bonafide star as well as critically acclaimed. Lynskey stars as the adult version of Shauna in the Showtime series, a Surburban mom who survived a plane crash as a teenager and spent a year-and-a-half stranded in the Canadian wilderness. Her portrayal has led to multiple awards nominations across the show's two seasons, including an Emmy, a Satellite Award and an Independent Spirit gong.\n\"There is something about having led a relatively private life and then suddenly being a lot more public,\" Lynskey said.\n\"I think Heather took to it a lot more easily than I did. I'm still quite shy and awkward. You know people sort of recognize me and I feel like I'm in trouble, but she's great with people.\"\nRead more: Earn Cash Back for Streaming Services\nThere is another benefit to playing Morris—the New Zealand native gets to use her real voice for the role.\n\"It's always nice to get to use my own accent,\" she said. \"She's from Te Awamutu, which is a town that I know. It's incredible.\"\nStream The Tattooist of Auschwitz on Peacock from May 2.\n",

    "content": "Georgia’s parliament is set to pass a highly controversial so-called “foreign agents” bill that has triggered widespread protests across the former Soviet republic nestled in the Caucasus Mountains.\nTens of thousands of people in capital city Tbilisi have been protesting the legislation. Critics warn that it mirrors a foreign agents law already passed in Russia and could jeopardize Georgia’s bid to join the European Union.\nBut Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze has said the government is not planning any “substantial changes” to the bill, and has vowed to get it passed on Tuesday, when lawmakers in the former Soviet country are expected to vote.\nHere’s what you need to know about the proposed law and the uproar it has caused.\nThe bill would require organizations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as “agents of foreign influence” or face crippling fines.\nThe legislation was drafted by the Georgian Dream party, which along with its allies controls parliament. The proposal will receive a vote on Tuesday and it is expected to pass.\nGeorgia President Salome Zourabichvili called the bill “an exact duplicate” of its Russian counterpart in an interview with CNN.\nShe has vowed to veto the bill, but that won’t mean much. Georgia’s government is a parliamentary system, so Zourabichvili is effectively a figurehead. Real power lies with Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze. Georgian Dream’s billionaire founder, former Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, also wields significant political influence.\nA couple of reasons.\nThe proposed law is modeled after a similar one in Russia that the Kremlin has used to increasingly snuff out opposition and civil society. Many Georgians fear their foreign agents bill will be used to the same way it has been in its northern neighbor: to quash dissent and free expression by going after nongovernmental organizations with financial ties overseas.\nGeorgian Dream contends the legislation will promote transparency and national sovereignty and has hit back at Western criticism over the proposal.\nBut the law’s possible passage has touched on a more existential question: whether Georgia’s future lies with Europe or Russia.\nGeorgia has, like Ukraine, been caught between the two geopolitical forces since achieving independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.\nMany Georgians feel deep hostility toward the Kremlin, which invaded Georgia in 2008 and occupies about 20% of its internationally recognized territory – about the same proportion that Russia occupies in Ukraine.\nGeorgian Dream has long been accused of harboring pro-Russian sympathies, especially given that Ivanishvili made his fortune in the Soviet Union.\nPassionately. So much so that lawmakers at one point came to blows over the bill.\nPolling shows that about 80% of Georgians support joining the European Union rather than drifting further into the Kremlin’s orbit, and many of those in favor of deepening ties with the West have taken to the streets.\nCNN's Anna Coren speaks to Giorgi Revishvili about Georgia's foreign agents bill, known to critics as the so called \"Russian law.\"\nRelated video\nExplaining the controversy surrounding Georgia’s foreign agents bill\nMass demonstrations against the bill in Tbilisi have been going on nightly for a month. About 50,000 people came out Sunday evening in the capital, which is home to about 1 million people, to speak out against what they’ve dubbed “the Russian law.”\nThere have been counter-protests as well. One saw the reclusive Ivanishvili deliver a rare speech to a crowd of supporters bussed in to Tbilisi from Georgia’s rural regions, where Georgian Dream enjoys more support.\nThe address showed deep paranoia and an autocratic streak. Ivanishvili claimed that Georgia was being controlled by “a pseudo-elite nurtured by a foreign country” and pledged to go after his political opponents after October’s elections.\nYes, just last year.\nGeorgia’s government tried to pass the same law but was forced into an embarrassing climbdown after a week of intense protests, which saw citizens waving EU flags buffeted back by water cannons.\nThe bill was reintroduced in March, about a month after Kobakhidze became Prime Minister. This time, authorities seem determined to push the legislation through.\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan wrote on X that Washington is “deeply alarmed about democratic backsliding in Georgia.”\n“Georgian parliamentarians face a critical choice – whether to support the Georgian people’s Euro-Atlantic aspirations or pass a Kremlin-style foreign agents’ law that runs counter to democratic values,” he said. “We stand with the Georgian people.”\nThe Kremlin has claimed that the law was being used to “provoke anti-Russian sentiments,” adding that protests against it were being stirred by “outside” influences.\n“This is now the normal practice of a huge number of states that are doing everything to protect themselves from outside influence, from foreign influence on domestic politics. And all countries are taking action in one form or another, but all these bills have the same goal,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in April. “Once again, there is no way to link this bill and the desire to secure Georgia’s internal politics with some kind of Russian influence; this is not the case.”\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement earlier this month that she was following the developments in George with “great concern” and reiterated Brussels’ unease over the law.\n“Georgia is at a crossroads. It should stay the course on the road to Europe,” she said.\nDefinitely.\nGeorgia first applied for EU membership in 2022 and was granted candidate status in December, an important but still early step in the process of becoming a member of the bloc. However, Brussels said last month that the law’s passage would “negatively impact” Georgia’s path to EU membership\n“Georgia has a vibrant civil society that contributes to the country’s successful progress towards EU membership. The proposed legislation would limit the capacity of civil society and media organizations to operate freely, could limit freedom of expression and unfairly stigmatize organizations that deliver benefits to the citizens of Georgia,” EU officials said.\n“The EU urges Georgia to refrain from adopting legislation that can compromise Georgia’s EU path, a path supported by the overwhelming majority of Georgian citizens.”\nCNN’s Anna Chernova contributed to this report.\n",

    "content": "Title IX has helped make the United States home to some of the highest educated, most athletically dominant women on the planet. But that won't stop the Biden administration from destroying Title IX to appease the most radical members of its party.\nBefore the Biden administration announced its new rule, Title IX had one purpose: to ensure women and girls have equal access to publicly funded educational opportunities. It didn't matter if that education took place in an elementary classroom or an NCAA basketball court; the purpose of Title IX was to protect opportunities for women and girls to learn and grow in a safe environment.\nThe Biden administration, however, appears to think women have had enough success.\nUnder its new rule, President Biden's Department of Education has abandoned accepted ideas of sex and gender to single-handedly interpret Title IX as protecting students from discrimination based on \"gender identity.\" Schools must now allow students to participate in any \"activity consistent with their gender identity,\" as asserted by the students themselves, or risk facing a discrimination lawsuit.\nThis will open up schools to lawsuits if they forbid biological boys from using girls' restrooms or locker rooms. The same will be true for schools that ban biological boys from the girls' health or physical education classes.\nPut differently, Title IX will no longer protect women based on their immutable physical characteristics. Instead, activists can weaponize Title IX to force schools to prioritize the comfortable education of the boy with gender dysphoria above the academic and emotional well-being of the dozens of girls who would rather not share a locker room or learn about puberty alongside biological boys.\nPresident Biden's new rule defeats the purpose of Title IX. By interpreting Title IX to be about protecting \"gender identity\" instead of physical gender, President Biden will place countless women and girls in uncomfortable—or even unsafe—learning environments.\nThe Biden administration is unperturbed. It dismissed the concerns of parents who don't want their daughters to share a bathroom with a biological man by denying that the \"mere presence of a transgender person in a single-sex space compromises anyone's legitimate privacy interest.\"\nPut down the bong.\nIt may be President Biden's belief that little girls do not have a legitimate privacy interest in only sharing restrooms with other women and girls, but common sense and most Americans disagree.\nThe Biden administration's Title IX rule will also require language restrictions, mandated by the federal government, on any teacher who wishes to use grammatically correct pronouns. Under the new rule, any teacher who refers to a little boy as \"he\" instead of \"they\" in a way that the federal government finds objectively offensive will trigger a lawsuit for discrimination. Grammar teachers might as well cancel the lesson on pronouns now.\nI have empathy for the small percentage of young people who suffer from gender dysphoria. Those students deserve to receive a quality education, too. We cannot, however, prioritize the comfort of a small set of gender dysphoric students over the safety, education and opportunities of all women and girls.\nTitle IX has protected women and girls for more than 50 years. President Biden ought to hide his head in a bag if he allows his administration to destroy decades of progress for women by turning Title IX into a weapon that his party can use to tear apart schools that don't support these anti-women gender policies.\nJohn Kennedy is a U.S. Senator from Louisiana.\nThe views expressed in this article are the writer's own.\n",

    "content": "Picture it: A spare concert ticket comes your way, leading to a chance encounter with an internationally renowned pop star. When performing at one of the most famous music festivals in the world, they stare past the blinding stage lights into the crowd to lock eyes with you. What transpires, naturally, is a whirlwind romance on the European leg of their sold out tour.\nIt’s a fantasy that — in some variation or another — has captured the human imagination for decades. Films such as “What Price Hollywood” and “A Star is Born” first dabbled in the idea of famous and non-famous relations almost 100 years ago. By 1999, the genre had reached new heights after the release of “Notting Hill” — the seminal Richard Curtis film which saw Julia Roberts, a graceful American movie star, fall for Hugh Grant, a bumbling British bookstore owner. Even more recently, “Starstruck,” the coincidental title of both a 2010 Disney Channel original movie and a 2021 BBC Three series, brought the agony and ecstasy of dating an A-lister as a mere member of the public to the small screen.\nNow, director Michael Showalter breathes new life into the trope with “The Idea of You,” out on Amazon Prime May 2. Based on the 2017 Robinne Lee novel by the same name, Showalter’s version is set in LA — the birthplace of lofty pipe dreams — starring both Anne Hathaway as Solène Marchand, a glamorous 40-year-old art gallery owner and divorced mother of one; and Nicholas Galitzine as 24-year-old Hayes Campbell, the fan favorite of fictional boy band du jour, August Moon.\nAfter a meet cute in Hayes’ trailer at Coachella, sparks fly and Solène finds herself being pursued by not only a fully fledged celebrity, but someone 16 years her junior. The internet hasn’t been shy in drawing parallels between Lee’s novel and the age gap relationship of Harry Styles and Olivia Wilde. And although the book was published four years before the pair began dating, Lee admitted she was intrigued by Styles’ life in particular. “Inspired is a strong word,” she told Vogue in 2020.\nBut more than just a piece of starry-eyed fan-fiction, “The Idea of You” is a Bildungsroman in disguise. Particularly in relation to the acutely female struggle for identity and individuality after motherhood. “We talk about coming-of-age stories as being something that happens in (the) earliest part of your life,” said Anne Hathaway at the film’s SXSW premiere. “I don’t know about you, but I feel like I keep blooming.”\nFlawed, hopeful, vulnerable yet composed, Solène’s three-dimensional character disrupts the misogynistic binary of cougar or crone. It was a consideration costume designer Jacqueline Demeterio took seriously when sourcing her wardrobe. “Solène’s 40. I mean, 40 is not old,” she said. “I didn’t want it to be this older lady meets this younger boy… and has this ‘Pretty Woman’ (makeover) moment.” There wasn’t a stitch of leopard print, teenage fashion or “Golden Girls” style pussybows. “She has her look,” said Demeterio. “She’s not trying to look young, but (her style) has evolved with time and with her body. You make adjustments, but you still dress cool.”\nFrom the first scene, Solène’s sartorial compass is established in a denim puff-sleeve dress from Chloé’s Fall-Winter 2023 collection and a pair of blonde suede Isabel Marant boots. It was the first look Hathaway tried on during fittings with Demeterio in New York. “I was like, ‘Yeah, this is Solène.’”\nHer fashion needle doesn’t deviate much throughout the film, as we see Solène in more Marant (a suede tote bag makes several appearances as an intentional nod to realistic rewearing), Etro, Gabriella Hearst, Valentino and vintage Chanel. These are the types of sophisticated yet understated labels you might expect a successful gallery owner to buy — quietly luxurious, sometimes sustainably minded and with a price tag accessible to a woman in her peak earning years.\nBut while Demeterio — who is a similar age to both Solène and Hathaway — was able to draw on personal taste and experience to flesh out the character, getting into the mind (and closet) of a 20-somethings heartthrob was different. “I tried some different directions with the wardrobe,” she said. “At first I went a little David Bowie, a little androgynous with the silk blouses and flared trousers. But I felt I was getting a little too showman and I didn’t want it to be a distraction.” And if the fashion sense of one young musician felt hard to pin down, there was also the question of outfitting August Moon. “There’s so many ways to go with a boyband,” Demeterio said. “There’s the BTS suits and matching Prada, or vintage pieces mixed in with streetwear, which is where I went with that.”\nRelated article\nHow ‘The Crown’ recreated Kate Middleton’s 2000s style\nHarry Styles was of course on the moodboard for Hayes — the patchwork tattoos and soft knit cardigans were a dead giveaway — but Demeterio insists this wasn’t an impression. “I didn’t want it to be, you know, he’s Harry,” she said. “Nick and I were sending images back and forth and one of his (ideas) was Matty Healy.” (On screen Hayes performed at Coachella in a pair of suit trousers and cotton vest — an outfit formula beloved by The 1975 singer). What stuck were elevated classics: A Bottega Veneta tank top, expertly fitted Loewe trousers or luxurious cardigans (again, by Isabel Marant). “Someone of his level would have his stylist go and buy designer pieces, even though it’s just (say) a cardigan. It’s the way it sits,” she said. And for those who want to recreate the A-lister off-duty look at home: Tailor your T-shirts, says Demeterio. “Nick would bring in his personal wardrobe like, ‘Can I have this shortened? Can your tailor come and shorten this?’” she laughed. “I created a monster of perfect T-shirt proportions.”\nPerhaps the most important element of Demeterio’s work was accurately reflecting the character’s 16 year age gap through clothes. When Hayes tracks down Solène at her Silver Lakes art gallery, for example, Nick appears in a slouchy cardi, white tank and snapback cap while Hathaway is dressed in a structured velvet blazer. They are star-crossed lovers, their doomed fate spelled out in apparel rather than astrology. During one of their last encounters, Hayes stands at the door, his enveloping oversized hoodie rendering him as diminished and slight as a wide-eyed adolescent. “I went back and forth on that,” Demeterio said. “Because I thought, does he look too juvenile? But this is showing the emotional struggle through the wardrobe. It was really because of what society was saying about the age gap, so I wanted it to be in your face a little bit.”\nBut if “The Idea of You” subverts any clichés in this particular rom-com genre, it’s that the celebrity must be more glamorous than their normie love interest. Constance Bennett in “What Price Hollywood” is discovered in her waitress uniform by Lowell Sherman, a suited-and-booted big-time director. In “Notting Hill,” Grant was relegated to a rotation of periwinkle blue button-downs while Roberts swanned about in her leather blazer and black beret. As for Hathaway, we find her in Chanel and leave her, happily ever after, in a rust-red Gabriela Hearst suit.\n",

    "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\nAfter years of delays and a dizzying array of setbacks during test flights, Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft is finally set to make its inaugural crewed launch.\nThe mission is on track to take off from Florida as soon as May 6, carrying NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore to the International Space Station, marking what could be a historic and long-awaited victory for the beleaguered Starliner program.\n“Design and development is hard — particularly with a human space vehicle,” said Mark Nappi, vice president and Starliner program manager at Boeing, during a Thursday news briefing. “There’s a number of things that were surprises along the way that we had to overcome. … It certainly made the team very, very strong. I’m very proud of how they’ve overcome every single issue that we’ve encountered and gotten us to this point.”\nBoeing and NASA officials made the decision Thursday to move forward with the launch attempt in less than two weeks. However, Ken Bowersox, associate administrator for NASA’s Space Operations Mission Directorate, noted that May 6 is “not a magical date.”\nRelated article\nHow SpaceX and NASA overcame a bitter culture clash to bring back US astronaut launches\n“We’ll launch when we’re ready,” he said.\nIf successful, the Starliner will join SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft in making routine trips to the space station, keeping the orbiting outpost fully staffed with astronauts from NASA and its partner space agencies.\nSuch a scenario — with both Crew Dragon and Starliner flying regularly — is one for which the US space agency has long waited.\n“This is history in the making,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said of the upcoming Starliner mission during a March 22 news conference. “We’re now in the golden era of space exploration.”\nSpaceX and Boeing developed their respective vehicles under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, a partnership with private industry contractors. From the outset, the space agency aimed to have both companies operating at once. The Crew Dragon and Starliner spacecraft would each serve as a backup to the other, giving astronauts the option to keep flying, even if technical issues or other setbacks grounded one spacecraft.\nNASA did not initially envision, however, that SpaceX’s Crew Dragon would operate on its own for nearly four years before Boeing’s Starliner reached its first crewed test flight.\nIn the earliest days of the program, which awarded SpaceX and Boeing contracts in 2014, NASA had favored Boeing — a close partner dating back to the mid-20th century — over SpaceX, which the federal agency saw as a relatively young and capricious upstart.\nAs recently as 2016, NASA was planning its schedule with the view that the Starliner would beat the Crew Dragon to the launchpad.\nBut the race between Boeing and SpaceX took a clear turn by 2020. Missteps riddled a Starliner test flight the prior year, leaving NASA and Boeing officials scrambling to figure out what went wrong. The Starliner did not dock with the space station on that mission due to software problems, including an issue with the spacecraft’s internal clock, which was off by 11 hours.\nMeanwhile, SpaceX made history in May 2020 with the launch of its Demo-2 test flight, carrying astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley on a two-month mission to the International Space Station.\nSpaceX’s Crew Dragon has been flying routine trips ever since, carrying NASA astronauts and even paying customers and tourists. The spacecraft has now flown 13 crewed missions to orbit.\nRelated article\nBoeing mission to send NASA astronauts to space station faces more lengthy delays\nBoeing, however, has spent several years contending with a string of challenges, including a list of issues that were uncovered in 2022 during the spacecraft’s second uncrewed test flight. Boeing’s commercial airplane division also has faced a series of scandals — including the 737 Max crisis and the recent quality control issues highlighted after a door plug blew off during an Alaska Airlines flight in January — that have damaged the company’s brand.\nNASA officials at one point in 2020 even admitted that they had turned more scrutiny toward SpaceX and its unorthodox ways, while issues with Boeing’s Starliner slipped through the cracks.\n“Perhaps we didn’t have as many people embedded in that process as we should have,” Steve Stich, NASA’s Commercial Crew Program manager, said at a July 2020 news conference.\n“When one provider (SpaceX) has a newer approach than another, it’s often natural for a human being to spend more time on that newer approach, and maybe we didn’t quite take the time we needed with (Boeing’s) more traditional approach.”\nBoeing’s space division operates separately from its commercial airline team, and officials at NASA and the US aerospace giant have routinely sought to make that distinction.\nNASA officials have also made clear they are working more closely with Boeing than ever, with personnel on the ground at Boeing facilities overseeing some of the fixes the company has put in place ahead of the upcoming Starliner flight.\n“This is an important capability for NASA. We signed up to go do this, and we’re gonna go do it and be successful at it,” Nappi said Thursday. “I don’t think of it in terms of what’s important for Boeing as much as I think of it as in terms of what’s important for this program.”\nStill, Boeing and NASA have had a long list of issues to address.\nDuring the last flight test in 2022, for example, engineers found that the suspension lines on the Starliner’s parachute had a lower threshold for failure than initially expected.\nRelated article\nNASA says it expected space station garbage to burn up. The debris smashed into a Florida home instead\nNASA and Boeing engineers tested a fix for that issue earlier this year, but parachutes will remain top of mind as they work through some last-minute checkouts before liftoff, Stich said Thursday.\nSome tape that was also used to protect wiring harnesses was found to be flammable, and Boeing had to remove and replace about a mile’s worth of the material, according to Nappi.\nBoeing may even need to implement a redesign of some of the spacecraft’s valves because of corrosion issues. That upgrade, however, is not expected to be in place until the second crewed flight, slated for 2025, at the earliest.\nOn May’s inaugural crewed flight, Boeing will instead use a “perfectly acceptable mitigation” that should prevent the valves from sticking, Nappi said in March.\nDespite the long path to the launchpad, the two people at the center of the Starliner’s first crewed mission — Williams and Wilmore, two longtime NASA astronauts — said as they arrived at the launch site that they are as confident as ever.\n“We want the general public to think it’s easy, but it’s not — it’s way hard,” Wilmore said after arriving at Starliner’s launch site in Florida on Thursday. “We wouldn’t be here if we weren’t ready. We are ready. The spacecraft’s ready, and the teams are ready.”\nWilmore mentioned at a March news conference that he is not expecting the Starliner spacecraft to enter any “failure modes.”\nRelated article\n5 ways the Columbia disaster changed spaceflight forever\n“But if something were to occur — because we’re all humans, we can’t build things perfectly — if something were to occur, we have several downgrade modes,” he said during the news conference, referring to modes that give the astronauts the ability to take more manual control over the spacecraft if something doesn’t go to plan.\nWilliams said during a March news event, “We wouldn’t be sitting here if we didn’t feel — and tell our families that we feel — confident in this spacecraft and our capabilities to control it.”\nShe added during the Thursday news briefing in Florida, “I have all the confidence in not only our capabilities and the spacecraft’s capabilities, but also our mission control team, who’s ready for the challenge.”\n",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.\nWelcome to week two of the Trump 2016 election interference trial.\nLast week was dominated by the drama of star witness David Pecker, the former National Enquirer publisher who brought to life for the jury the “catch-and-kill” schemes that prosecutors say were intended to benefit Trump’s campaign. But after he finished his testimony Friday afternoon, we settled into what is likely to be the next phase of the case: getting all the evidence in. That means some less dramatic intervals are ahead. But because the narrative and the stakes were made so clear in week one, week two is likely to sustain the interest of the jury and all of us – even if it may not stop the defendant’s penchant for napping.\nThose of us who spend time in courtrooms know trials can’t always be “Law & Order,” in which prosecutors elicit damning testimony – and sometimes even outright confessions – from witnesses every time one takes the stand. In the real world, lawyers also have to prove every element of their case. And the case Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg brought is, at heart, a documents case – Trump has been charged with 34 counts of felony record falsification, actions allegedly taken to cover up hush money payoffs connected to the 2016 election. So the prosecutors will need to take the time to present all the documentation to prove that the allegedly illicit payments were made and that the allegedly criminal false documentation was filed.\nBut as demonstrated by longtime Trump assistant Rhona Graff’s testimony Friday afternoon, the methodical nature of the testimony and evidence doesn’t mean it will be dull for the jury. Juries adapt to the ebb and flow of a trial, and this jury was attentive to Graff’s words about maintaining contact information for two of Trump’s alleged paramours who prosecutors say received secret payoffs to benefit the Trump campaign: Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels. Some jurors took copious notes and others listened closely.\nPecker had introduced them to a starry world of celebrities and sex scandals, and an alleged backroom deal with a presidency in the balance. Now we are building the details out, piece by piece. So if last week evoked primetime soaps such as “Dallas” and “Dynasty,” this week promises to be “Columbo”– a police procedural putting together all the clues needed to solve the mystery.\nRelated article\nOpinion: Trump attorney’s embarrassing courtroom apology\nThis type of testimony, though technical, is essential: Prosecutors can’t just stand up and assert certain payments were made, or present to the jury a document that has not been authenticated and introduced as evidence. The DA has to establish every factual element, and they will do that through the reams of documents that will be introduced into evidence this week. That proof will also help corroborate the testimony of future witnesses, like former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, who arranged hush money payments, and payoff recipient Daniels. And any omissions or misrepresentations in documents also help show the intent to cover up the payment scheme to benefit the campaign.\nThe testimony of Gary Farro, Cohen’s onetime banker, is emblematic of what we are likely to hear from other witnesses this week. Farro began testifying on Friday after Graff, and the prosecution had him corroborate various bank records related to the formation of the limited liability companies that Cohen created as part of the alleged scheme to bury damaging stories during the presidential campaign.\nFor example, Assistant District Attorney Rebecca Mangold had Farro verify one record in which Cohen offered a detailed description of the purpose of the limited liability company that he had created to facilitate payments to McDougal, one of those who claimed to have had an affair with Trump – but Cohen omitted any mention about acquiring the rights to her potentially damaging story. Mangold also had Farro verify a bank record for the LLC that Cohen had created to facilitate the payments to Daniels on which Cohen affirmed that the entity was not associated with political fundraising. Prosecutors allege the entity was formed to do the exact opposite: make a payoff to influence an election.\nSomething that separates good lawyers from great ones is how they handle the less juicy bits of a trial. The Manhattan prosecutors trying this case have already proven their mettle – and I expect they will march through these documentation witnesses thoroughly but expeditiously, keeping things moving so that the jury’s attention does not wander too far.\n\nTrump’s lawyers are also competent, so expect them to get what they can from the witnesses. When defense counsel elicited from Graff on cross-examination that Trump was a good boss, she became a free character witness. And while it’s true that, after her testimony concluded, Graff politely rebuffed Trump’s attempt to shake her hand, that alone won’t undermine her positive character testimony (even if it might strike jurors as odd).\nSometimes the defense will stipulate – that is, simply agree with the prosecution – to much of this evidentiary work in an effort to get it over with. It’s coming in to evidence anyhow if prosecutors are competent (which these certainly are). But that doesn’t seem to be happening here. Trump and his counsel are the masters of delay – trying to squeeze every moment of postponement out of the process that they can. After all, the longer this case goes, the further away they can push the scheduling of any other of the criminal trials against him. Accordingly, Team Trump appears to be forcing the DA team to go step by step.\nSo the jury may be dealing with a relatively more mundane set of topics on and off over the next few days – but they seem up for seeing it through and even interested. And while the odds that Trump may fall asleep again remain high, he would be wiser to remain alert as prosecutors build their case piece by piece.\n",

    "content": "Arianna Smith is juggling a lot right now.\nSmith is editor-in-chief of The Lantern, Ohio State University’s student-run newspaper, which has scrambled in recent days to cover pro-Palestinian protests roiling the campus.\nIt’s also finals week, and in the coming days the newspaper’s staff will transition to the next year’s staff. But the news doesn’t account for exams.\n“We have had reporters and editors drop everything they are doing [to cover the story], even though they have finals that they should be studying for,” Smith told CNN.\nAs universities across the country crack down on demonstrations over Israel’s military actions in Gaza and police arrest hundreds of protesters, student-run newspapers have quickly become an essential source of news coverage for both the campus communities and nation at large, providing crucial transparency and scrutiny of authorities.\nAnd, for many of these student journalists, it’s becoming a seminal moment in their nascent careers.\n“It’s so important to have journalists that care about being objective, and to have journalists that really know the power that their writing has,” Smith said of her newspaper’s reporters.\nWhen demonstrations broke out on the Columbus campus this week, resulting in multiple arrests, the Lantern’s staff reported from the protest scenes, detailed actions of the police, and investigated Ohio State University policies barring encampments.\n“We’re not only covering the protests, but we’re covering and getting the opinions from these people that are involved in this protest,” Smith said. “And we’re also making sure that we’re analyzing the legalities behind all of these policies that the university is enforcing.”\nAt the University of Southern California, nearly 100 people were arrested this week as protests swelled on campus and university leaders imposed restrictions on demonstrations.\nAnjali Patel, editor-in-chief of the university’s newspaper, The Daily Trojan, immediately recognized the student-led publication had an advantage over the national press as they raced to cover the story.\n“Given that we’re student journalists, we know the campus and the students here. That gives us a different angle than professional news outlets,” Patel said. “We’re also completely student-led, so the way that we approach work and reporting is different, but I think that’s to our advantage.”\nThe tension at USC has been boiling since administrators canceled its Muslim valedictorian’s commencement speech — and, on Thursday, the main graduation ceremony — citing safety concerns. As pressure mounted on campus, the newspaper mobilized a handful of writers who worked together to cover the protests. But, as police were deployed on campus, The Daily Trojan increased the number of assigned reporters to cover events.\nWhen officers moved to make dozens of arrests Wednesday at a protest encampment, it was “all hands on deck,” Patel said, adding that The Daily Trojan deployed at least five photographers and eight other staff members to cover the demonstrations.\nThese young journalists, while juggling classes and the stress of exams, are also intimately involved with the student community, translating the student body’s mood on their campus for the rest of the nation.\nAt the University of Texas at Austin, dozens of protesters were arrested Wednesday after pro-Palestinian demonstrators were met by state troopers “in full riot gear with batons,” Amelia Kimball, associate managing editor of The Daily Texan told CNN.\nKimball reported that there was a “physical clash” between students and police on campus with numerous students taken into custody and “put in squad cars.”\nThe arrests came as Texas Governor Greg Abbott warned that “antisemitism will not be tolerated in Texas” and called for students participating in the protests to be expelled.\n“I think there’s a real feeling of betrayal on campus and I think there’s a lot of anger [after students were arrested],” Kimball told CNN’s John Berman.\n“State troopers were on campus before students even began to gather,” Kimball added. “And so things just escalated far beyond what students had expected at all, and so yeah, I think students feel betrayed by the university and by our state government.”\n",

    "content": "US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced on Friday a $6 billion long-term military aid package for Ukraine — the largest to date — which will allow the US to purchase new equipment produced by the American defense industry for the Ukrainian military.\n“This is the largest security assistance package that we’ve committed to date. It will include critical interceptors for Ukraine’s patriot and NASAMS air defense systems, more counter drone systems and support equipment, significant amounts of artillery ammunition, and air to ground munitions and maintenance and sustainment support,” Austin said during a press conference on Friday.\nThe announcement comes just days after the US announced a $1 billion package that would quickly provide equipment to Ukraine from US stocks, following President Joe Biden’s signing of a much delayed $95 billion supplemental aid package on Wednesday.\nBiden said moments after signing the legislation that shipments of aid to Ukraine would begin within hours. Equipment under the $6 billion package announced Friday, however, will take much longer to arrive.\nUnlike drawdown packages which pull military equipment directly from US stocks, Friday’s aid announcement falls under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), which contracts with industry to procure the equipment. The USAI is intended to provide Ukraine with a long-term supply of weapons and equipment.\nAustin said Friday that the timeline for delivery would depend on what systems are purchased, but that the Pentagon is “going to move as fast as we can to get them the capability as fast as industry can produce.”\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. CQ Brown, speaking alongside Austin on Friday, said that the USAI package would provide Ukraine with “more flexibility.”\n“They’ve had to actually ration conserve munitions over time,” Brown said. “And so with this package, and the follow-on factors because of the supplemental, gives them a bit more flexibility to be able to operate and use that capability effectively against the Russian threat.”\nAustin and Brown’s press conference followed the virtual Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting on Friday morning, held two years to the day since the very first meeting in Germany.\nAhead of the meeting’s start, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the group of allies, thanking them for their support but also urging them to send more assistance, particularly with air defense.\nAustin commended the Ukrainians during Friday’s press conference for being “able to hold their own” without significant support from the US over the last few months, and said the capabilities that will start flowing in will help them “do a lot better.”\n“As I talked to Ukrainian leadership, they are confident that they can continue to hold their own and then and then, as they get a bit stronger, they’ll have options available,” he said.\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n",

The rule, which was set to go into effect Tuesday, would save consumers about $10 billion per year by cutting fees from an average of $32, the CFPB estimated.\nA preliminary injunction means the rule can’t go into effect until a hearing is held where the case can be adjudicated in greater detail.\n“The credit card lobby’s lawsuit is an attempt to derail a rule that will save families $10 billion each year in order to continue making tens of billions of dollars in profits by charging borrowers late fees that far exceed their actual costs,” a CFPB spokesperson told CNN in a statement. “Consumers will shoulder $800 million in late fees every month that the rule is delayed — money that pads the profit margins of the largest credit card issuers. We will continue to defend this rule so that working families can stop paying excessive late fees that Congress banned more than a decade ago.”\nMaria Monaghan, the counsel for the US Chamber of Commerce Litigation Center, said in a statement Friday that the ruling was “a major win for responsible consumers who pay their credit card bills on time and businesses that want to provide affordable credit,” and that it would “continue to hold the CFPB accountable in court.”\n“It is disappointing that the court has granted this last-ditch effort by the banks to prevent these critical limits on credit card late fees from going into effect next week,” said Chuck Bell, advocacy program director for non-profit Consumer Reports. “Credit card companies have been bilking consumers out of billions of dollars in excessive late fees for far too long.”\nThe rule, first proposed in February 2023, is part of a broader push by the Biden administration to eliminate “junk fees,” considered hidden or misleading charges to consumers.\nThe new rule would apply to large credit card issuers — those with more than 1 million accounts. These companies represent more than 95% of total outstanding credit card debt, according to the CFPB.\nThe push to target credit card fees is part of the Biden administration’s efforts to ease financial burdens for many Americans. Some borrowers, especially millennials and those with lower incomes, have fallen behind on their credit card debt following more than two years of high inflation.\nThe new rule also intended to close a 2010 loophole the CFPB says has been “exploited” by credit card companies to hike fees on late payments.\nAccording to a national Consumer Reports survey published in September, one in five American adults said they had paid a credit card late fee in the previous 12 months. Eighty-two percent said they supported lowering the maximum late fee.\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\nCNN’s Matt Egan contributed to this report.\n",

Those who have a sensitivity to sulfites are at risk of a serious or life-threatening reaction if they consume products containing the undeclared allergen, read the release.\nRead more: What Is a Health Savings Account?\nThe recall applies to 19 boxes of the 14-ounce apricot rolls, which were sold in clear plastic bags and packaged with the Aahu Barah label on the front and back. The expiration date of the rolls included in the recall is December 2025. The UPC code of the affected products is 882475000279.\nThe boxes were distributed in retail stores across six states: New York, Texas, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Georgia.\nUnder FDA guidelines, the presence of sulfites must be declared on food products if the sulfites present are at 10 parts per million or more. Sulfites are not one of the nine major allergens required to be listed on a food products label under the Food Allergy, Treatment, Education and Research Act.\nRead more: Find the Right Tax-Advantaged Health Savings Account\nAccording to the Cleveland Clinic, sulfites are chemicals used as preservatives in food, beverages and medications. Around 4 to 5 percent of people with asthma also have some sort of sulfite sensitivity. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, around 7.4 percent of the U.S. population had asthma in 2021.\nSulfites can trigger asthma attacks and allergic reactions in those who are sensitive. Symptoms of a sulfite allergy or sensitivity include wheezing; shortness of breath; chest tightness; coughing; sneezing; a stuffy or runny nose; and hives, according to the Cleveland Clinic's website. In rare occasions, severe allergic reactions can be trigged by exposure to sulfites, which can cause difficulty breathing or swallowing; flushing of the skin; fast heartbeat; dizziness vomiting; and diarrhea.\nThose who have asthma or other food allergies are more likely to react to sulfites. According to the FDA release, there have been no reported illnesses or allergic reactions associated with the recall.\nConsumers who have purchased an apricot roll under the recall are urged to return it to the retail store where they purchased it, for a full refund. Any questions about the recall can be directed to Aahu Barah at 516-396-0710.\n",

    "content": "Barbra Streisand's message about Israeli hostages held captive by Hamas in Gaza has deeply divided people.\nThe Jewish singer spoke out as she shared a New York Times article from March about a former hostage who said she was sexually assaulted while in captivity.\n\"It goes without saying that hostages are suffering and must be released now. There is an additional horror for female hostages. What they endure in terms of sexual violence should be – as the UN said, 'clear and convincing' to all. It should also be unequivocally denounced,\" she wrote on X, formerly Twitter, in a post that has been viewed almost 500,000 in 24 hours.\nPalestinian militant group Hamas kidnapped around 250 people from Israel in a surprise attack there on October 7, when its fighters also killed 1,200 people. Israel's subsequent military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 37,100, according to the latest figures from Associated Press.\nA United Nations report from March based on research gathered in January found Hamas had committed sexual violence against some female hostages, based their firsthand accounts, as well as against women during its October 7 attack.\nAnother U.N. report released on Wednesday described ongoing sexual violence committed by Israeli forces in Gaza and the West Bank, which it said amounted to \"war crimes.\" The Human Rights Council report claimed \"specific forms of sexual and gender-based violence constitute part of Israeli Security Forces' operating procedure.\"\nIt also found members of Palestinian armed groups committed sexual violence against Israelis.\nResponses to Streisand's post were mixed. Some people accused her for not speaking up sooner in favor of Israel and its hostages, while others tried discredit her claims.\n\"Nice to see a legend in the music industry speak up while too many are silent.\nThank you Barbara,\" replied @JudeanGeneral.\nBut @nickberoxbe1989 added: \"What took you so long? Are you afraid of upsetting your friends and fans?\"\nAnd @bonsaisky wrote: \"She's repeating the same debunked lies 😂\"\nStreisand has long been vocal in her support of Israel and described herself, in a 1987 interview with Esquire magazine, as \"a Jewess through and through, although I'm not religious.\"\nShe attended a rally at the Hollywood Bowl in 1967 which was put on to raise emergency funds for Israel after the Six-Day War.\nThe singer was good friends with late Israeli politician Shimon Peres and has made numerous statements since the October 7 attack.\nShe wrote on Instagram in December: \"When I first met Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres years ago, I asked him 'How can you help the Palestinians?' He replied 'By making their lives better!' We needed his advice then, and should urgently heed it now. In my humble opinion, we need a two-state solution that will hopefully bring peace and prosperity to the region.\"\nDays after the Hamas attack she took to Instagram, where she wrote: \"The population of Israel is under 10 million people. There are over 700 confirmed Israeli dead from the terrorist attack on civilians. The equivalent in the US would be over 25,000 dead in New York City on 9/11.\"\nShe also appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert the following day, where the eponymous host asked her about the conflict.\n\"People are people,\" Streisand said. \"It's true. We all want the same thing. We all want love in our hearts. We all want family. We all want to feel secure. I hope for the best because this is heartbreaking what's happening now with these people, the children, the mothers—doesn't matter what religion they are. This is beyond religion. This is insanity for us not to learn how to live together in peace.\"\n\"I could easily cry about this,\" she continued. \"Where is God in this time? Where is he or she?\"\n",

    "content": "On Thursday, the Jacksonville Jaguars agreed to a massive five-year, $275 million extension with quarterback Trevor Lawrence, making him the highest-paid QB in the NFL on a per-year basis alongside Cincinnati Bengals signal-caller Joe Burrow.\nLawrence and Burrow will each get $55 million per season, which is more than any of their peers in the NFL.\nWith Lawrence now at the top of the charts, the highest-paid quarterback list needs some updating. But the most interesting thing about it? Not one of the quarterbacks has a Super Bowl to his name.\nHere's the updated list:\nT-1. Trevor Lawrence, Jacksonville Jaguars, $55 million per year.\nT-1. Joe Burrow, Cincinnati Bengals, $55 million per year.\n3. Jared Goff, Detroit Lions, $53 million per year.\n4. Justin Herbert, Los Angeles Chargers, $52.5 million per year.\n5. Lamar Jackson, Baltimore Ravens, $52 million per year.\n6. Jalen Hurts, Philadelphia Eagles, $51 million per year.\nThree of these quarterbacks have appeared in Super Bowls — Burrow, Goff, and Hurts — but all three lost and haven't been back since. The other quarterbacks have experienced little to no postseason success.\nLawrence, the now highest-paid quarterback in the NFL, has one career postseason win in three seasons.\nBurrow, who's tied with Lawrence at the top, has five career playoff wins in four seasons.\nGoff, the oldest quarterback on this list, has five career playoff wins in eight seasons.\nHerbert, who's only played one playoff game in his career, has zero career postseason wins in four seasons and was a part of a 27-point blown lead against Lawrence and the Jags.\nJackson, a two-time MVP winner, has just two career playoff wins in six seasons.\nAnd Hurts, an MVP runner-up, has two career playoff wins in four seasons.\nSo, the six highest-paid quarterbacks in the NFL on a per-year basis have combined to play 29 seasons and win only 15 playoff games.\nHuh?\nWhile I understand it's difficult to find a franchise quarterback in the NFL, and I also understand it's even more difficult to win a Super Bowl, something's not adding up here.\nThere is nothing more important in sports than winning at the highest level, and for some reason, that isn't a leading factor in these massive extensions.\nOf course, these extensions are banking on future success. But at the same time, it's hard to build a winning team when a quarterback is getting paid more than $50 million a season — especially when that quarterback can't single-handedly take a team to the Super Bowl like Patrick Mahomes.\nThe pressure will be on Lawrence and the rest of these quarterbacks to perform over the next few seasons. If they can't perform, these contracts could turn into real albatrosses sooner rather than later.\nThe quarterbacks remembered as the greatest of all-time are measured not by their career earnings or regular season wins, but by the championship rings in their collection. The six highest-paid quarterbacks in today's NFL have none.\n",

    "content": "Water supplies in the U.S. are among the safest in the world, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports. But water quality does still vary from state to state. So which states have the best drinking water?\nThe Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) of 1974 was passed to protect public health in the U.S. by providing federal regulation of the nation's public drinking water supply. To meet these standards, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set limits on over 90 contaminants in drinking water, including chemical contaminants, like lead and arsenic, and microbial contaminants, like Giardia and Cryptosporidium.\nRead more: What Is a Health Savings Account?\nFailure to meet these limits can result in being cited with an official \"violation.\" The majority of safety violations recorded every year are a result of untimely water monitoring and reporting, but there are still thousands of annual health-related violations, which pose a real risk to the public.\nTo explore how these violations vary across different states, Newsweek compiled data from the EPA's Enforcement and Compliance History Online for safe drinking water. Violations related to human health were counted for each state over the past five years, between 2019-2023. Using census data from July 2023, the violations per 100,000 people in each state and Washington, D.C., were calculated.\nRead more: Find the Right Tax-Advantaged Health Savings Account\nAfter ranking states according to their water quality violations, these regions came out on top:\nMeanwhile, those with the most health-related violations during this period were as follows:\nThe EPA warns that the total number of health-related violations does not necessarily equate to water quality.\n\"The data reported to the EPA consists of violations of Safe Drinking Water Act regulations,\" a spokesperson from the EPA told Newsweek. \"Compliance data reported to the EPA does not directly measure drinking water quality as this depends on violation type and other factors unique to each water system.\n\"EPA does not rank states based on violations reported to the Safe Drinking Water Information System, or SDWIS. It does use violation and other data reported to SDWIS to inform its oversight and enforcement efforts as well as provide assistance to primacy agencies where needed. Violation count should not be the only factor considered when measuring state performance; for example, a high violation count could mean there is a robust state oversight program.\"\nStates like Alaska and Wyoming also have relatively small populations for their size, meaning that there there could be more violations per person because there are simply fewer people. Indeed, if we look at absolute numbers, Texas has the highest total number of health-based drinking water violations, but also has the second highest population in the U.S., so more drinking water systems are needed and used (and therefore would have more violations due to the sheer quantity of water systems).\nIs there a health problem that's worrying you?

I love the merch, love it all.\"\n\"I was honored to be asked to come to the White House to meet the most legislatively successful president of my lifetime,\" he continued. \"It just shows you, one person can be so influential and so positive in our lives.\"\nHamill went on to describe his visit with Biden as \"so amazing,\" while revealing that he had previously made shorter White House visits during the administrations of former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama.\nDespite having jokingly asked the reporters for \"no Star Wars questions, please,\" Hamill was then asked if Biden had mentioned the franchise during his visit.\n\"Well, you know, I called him 'Mr. President' and he said, 'You can call me Joe,'\" Hamill responded. \"I said, 'Can I call you Joe-bi Wan Kenobi?' He liked that.\"\nNewsweek reached out for comment to the White House via email on Friday evening.\nConservatives, perhaps predictably, reacted with disdain to the remarks from Hamill, an outspoken Democrat who frequently mocks former President Donald Trump on social media.\n\"WTF is Mark Hamill doing at the press briefing while the Marxists are burning down the country,\" conservative pundit and former Trump administration official Monica Crowley posted to X, formerly Twitter.\n\"Just when you think that the Biden Regime can't possibly be a bigger embarrassment, they rolled out washed up actor Mark Hamill to tell everyone not to believe your lying eyes, because Crooked Joe Biden is doing a great job,\" wrote @LangmanVince.\n\"Mark Hamill isn't right in the head,\" @MAGAMichelleS69 said.\nFriday was not the first time that Hamill has alluded to Star Wars for political purposes. In 2022, he signed up as an \"ambassador\" for Ukraine's United24 fundraising platform to bolster the country's \"Army of Drones\" program, while taking the opportunity to refer to Russia as the \"evil empire.\"\nPrior to the 2020 presidential election, Hamill compared Biden to Luke Skywalker, saying that \"the force is strong\" with the then-future president as he shared images of Biden spliced into Star Wars on X, then Twitter.\nFormer Trump campaign adviser Brad Parscale seemingly embraced the idea that Trump was part of the \"empire\" by comparing the Trump campaign to a Death Star, the gigantic weapon of mass destruction that appears in multiple Star Wars films.\nHamill has continued to regularly share pro-Biden and anti-Trump messages on X. This week, he has posted a series of political messages that appear to be in preparation for May 4—a special occasion for Star Wars fans who celebrate it as \"May the Fourth\" due to a resemblance to the film quote \"may the force be with you.\"\n\"May The First Not Quench Your Thirst For Biden's Re-election! #BidenHarris2024,\" Hamill posted on Wednesday.\n\"May The Second Biden Administration Be As Productive and Successful As The 1st,\" he continued on Thursday.\n\"May The Third Be Absurd That The Guy Who Tried To Steal A Fair Election Is Allowed To Run Again,\" reads Hamill's most recent post on Friday.\n",

Based on the 1815 Jane Austen novel of the same name, the movie's star-studded cast included Toni Collette, Alan Cumming, Jeremy Northam and Ewan McGregor.\nWelsh actress Ruth Jones was in the early stages of her career when she landed the small role of \"Bates' Maid\" in the film. However, she has now stated that her experience on the set left a lot to be desired.\nSpeaking of the latest episode of Wondery's Brydon & podcast, which is hosted by her longtime friend and Gavin & Stacey co-star Rob Brydon, Jones looked back over her career before sharing a less-than-favorable recollection of her time in Paltrow's presence.\nNewsweek reached out to a representative of Paltrow via email for comment.\n\"It was the first film I'd done. I had two lines [in the script],\" Jones said. \"I had to announce Gwyneth Paltrow and say, 'Miss Woodhouse is here,' and then I had to say, 'Goodbye, Miss Woodhouse' at the exit and let her out. And Gwyneth Paltrow cut one of my lines.\"\nJones said of Paltrow: \"She said, 'Does she really need to say that. I mean, can I just come in?' Now, imagine this for people who are starting out. You've got two lines, and someone cut 50 percent of your script. It's heartbreaking.\n\"I was very fortunate because Sophie Thompson [who played Miss Bates] was in that scene as well...and she was lovely and it was really nice. But with Gwyneth, no, she wanted to cut my lines.\n\"When I had to do the scene letting her out of the house, you can imagine the camera is on the other side of the door, in this beautiful little Dorset village, lovely little thatched cottage,\" Jones went on. \"We were waiting for them to shout 'action,' so it was just me and Gwyneth behind the door. She didn't want to talk to me. I mean, I was a nothing. I had one line, then I was down to one.\n\"So, I tried to make conversation with her. At the time she was going out with Brad Pitt, and I said, 'Do you have any Welsh connections? Because Gwyneth, I always think of as a Welsh name. Where did the name come from? How come you're called Gwyneth?' She said, 'My mother had a friend called Gwyneth, and she really liked the name, so she called me Gwyneth.'\"\n\"She was quite dismissive of me. So I was thinking, 'Yeah, well it's an old woman's name where I come from, love, and when you marry Brad Pitt, you're going to be Gwyn Pitt.'\"\nDespite her recollection of their interaction, BAFTA winner Jones, who is currently starring in a London stage production of the musical Sister Act, later conceded that expressing the need to cut others' lines is a \"tricky\" task.\n\"I would never say it in front of the actor. I would never embarrass them like that,\" she told Brydon. \"You have to do things that are right for the show, don't you? You're not doing it just to be mean. But it is a very tricky one, that.\"\n",

Sounds like the plot of a future Marvel movie, but in actual fact, it’s what could be the future of Pacific naval defenses.\nGhost Shark and Manta Ray are the names of prototype uncrewed underwater vehicles – UUVs or drones – introduced recently by Australia and the United States respectively.\nExperts say the submersibles could represent the future of undersea warfare, showing the ability to exert power while minimizing the danger to human life.\nThe use of drones in aerial warfare has become commonplace. The US used them extensively during conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan beginning in the 1990s, and newer, cheaper drones have become key pieces of military hardware for both sides in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nKyiv has also built naval surface drones, which have inflicted heavy losses on the much larger and more expensive ships of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet.\nAerial and surface sea drones can be controlled using satellites and light and radio waves. But those don’t function in the same way in the depths.\nA 2023 study published in the Swiss journal Sensors points out that underwater communications require more energy but still see significant data loss to variables including water temperature, salinity and depth.\nMakers of the new generation of military UUVs aren’t saying how they would overcome communications problems.\nBut when Australia unveiled Ghost Shark last month, it called the prototypes “the most advanced undersea autonomous vehicles in the world.”\n“Ghost Shark will provide Navy with a stealthy, long-range autonomous undersea warfare capability that can conduct persistent intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR) and strike,” a statement from the Australian Defense Ministry said, adding that it expects the first production models to be delivered by the end of next year.\nAustralian officials and those from manufacturer Anduril Australia said they could not share any of the specs on Ghost Shark as those remain classified.\nBut they touted the speed with which the submersible has gone from idea to testing, with the program having started just two years ago.\n“Being ahead of schedule, on budget, it’s pretty unheard of,” Shane Arnott, Anduril’s senior vice president for engineering, told reporters.\n“Delivering the first Ghost Shark prototype ahead of schedule sets a new standard for capability development at the speed of need,” Australia’s chief defense scientist, Tanya Monro, said in a statement.\nEmma Salisbury, a fellow at the British think tank Council on Geostrategy, said the Ghost Shark seems much like the Orca extra-large UUV being developed in the US.\nRelated article\nA Ukrainian pilot outlines how drones powered by jet skis sunk a Russian warship\n“I assume that they are all intended for roughly similar mission sets – persistent intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and strike capability, particularly in the anti-submarine domain,” Salisbury said.\nThe US Navy called the Boeing-built Orca UUV “a cutting-edge, autonomous, unmanned diesel-electric submarine with a modular payload section to execute a variety of missions” in a December news release on the delivery of a first Orca test platform, an early prototype.\nHaving a modular payload means the Orca in theory could carry different weapons varieties depending upon the task or be fitted with specialized equipment for reconnaissance or possibly intelligence gathering.\nThe release said the Pentagon would acquire five more of the UUVs, without giving a timetable. But the US Orca has been in the works for more than a decade, the Navy release said, a sharp contrast to the speed with which Australia has developed Ghost Shark.\nChris Brose, Anduril’s chief strategy officer, said the company and Australia are in the “process of proving” that “these kinds of capabilities can be built much faster, much cheaper, much more intelligently.”\nAnduril Australia said the entirely domestically developed Ghost Shark would be made available for export after it joins the Australian naval fleet.\nMeanwhile, back across the Pacific, the Orca isn’t the only UUV being developed in the US.\nAmerica’s latest UUV entry is Northrop Grumman’s Manta Ray, a prototype of which was tested off Southern California in February and March.\nThe Defense Advanced Research Products Agency (DARPA), the Pentagon branch in charge of developing new technologies, says Manta Ray’s strength is in its modularity, the ability to switch out payloads depending on the mission.\nIt can be broken down and fit into five standard shipping containers, move to where it’s going to be deployed, and reassembled in the field, according to Northrop Grumman.\nThe prototype was built in Maryland and then reassembled on the California coast.\n“The combination of cross-country modular transportation, in-field assembly, and subsequent deployment demonstrates a first-of-kind capability for an extra-large UUV,” Kyle Woerner, who heads the Manta Ray program at DARPA, said in an agency news release.\nHe also noted the modular transport method means the Manta Ray can save internal energy for its mission, rather than using it to get to the deployment site.\nLike the Orca, the Manta Ray hasn’t come together as quickly as Ghost Shark. Its program began in 2020 and DARPA didn’t give a goal for the Manta Ray – or some variant of it – to join the US fleet.\nRelated article\nA Houthi missile was just seconds from hitting a US warship. The Navy used its ‘last line of defense’\n“DARPA is engaging with the U.S. Navy on the next steps for testing and transition of this technology,” the agency’s release said.\nMeanwhile, China, named by the US military as its “pacing threat” in the Pacific, is also making advances in UUVs, Salisbury said.\n“While details are scarce, as with most Chinese capabilities, they have been developing them for at least 15 years and likely now have something similar to the Orca (but with torpedoes) in the testing phase,” she said.\nSubmarine expert H I Sutton says on his Covert Shores website that, according to an analysis of open-source intelligence, Beijing is believed to have at least six extra-large UUVs under development.\nBesides Australia, the US and China, other countries working on UUVs include Canada, France, India, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Norway, Russia, South Korea, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, according to Sutton.\n",

    "content": "The Russian military is attempting to \"take advantage\" of delays in U.S. aid deliveries to Ukraine reaching the war's frontline, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW).\nAn ISW report published on Wednesday noted that Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser in the office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, had told Bloomberg in an interview published on the same day that the recently approved American military aid was taking \"weeks\" to reach \"critical volumes\" where they are needed most.\n\"At the moment, Russian troops have the absolute advantage in shells, missiles, etc,\" Podolyak told Bloomberg. \"They will try to press along the frontline to advance. And then they may try to force the pro-Ukrainian coalition to accept unacceptable terms.\"\nISW, a U.S.-based think tank that regularly releases assessments of the Russia-Ukraine war, argued that Russia's attempt to \"freeze the current frontline\" amid the aid stall would be particularly \"advantageous\" to Moscow's war effort.\n\"Podolyak warned that Russia may be trying to force Ukraine and its allies to freeze the current frontline—a situation that ISW has long assessed would be advantageous to Russia by giving the Russian military time to reconstitute and prepare for renewed aggression against Ukraine,\" the ISW report reads.\n\"Additional Western military assistance will also likely take time to reach the front lines and to be properly integrated into Ukrainian frontline troop formations,\" it continues.\nA State Department spokesperson told Newsweek that U.S. officials had been \"anticipating that Russia would launch an offensive against Kharkiv, which appears to have begun,\" while adding, \"The Department of Defense is moving heaven and earth to deliver these supplies to Ukraine as rapidly as possible.\"\nNewsweek reached out for comment to the Ukrainian military via email on Wednesday night.\nRussia made several key advances in its more than two-year invasion of Ukraine during the early months of this year, when military aid to Kyiv from Western allies, particularly the U.S., slowed significantly.\nWhile an aid package worth over $61 billion was finally passed by Congress and signed into law by President Joe Biden in April, military experts and Ukrainian officials have continued to express concerns that the aid is being delivered too slowly.\nDuring an interview with Reuters last week, Zelensky pleaded with Western allies to make quicker decisions and speed up their deliveries of aid. Several of Ukraine's European NATO allies, such as Sweden and Belgium, have recently committed to sending more aid to Kyiv.\n\"Every decision to which we, then later everyone together, comes to is late by around one year,\" Zelensky said. \"But it is what it is: one big step forward, but before that two steps back. So we need to change the paradigm a little bit.\"\nZelensky also said that the Ukrainian Air Force, which has relied on an aging fleet of Soviet-era MiG aircraft during the war, needed allies to supply around 130 U.S.-made F-16s to counter Russia's air superiority.\nWhile several European NATO nations have pledged to give Ukraine a far smaller number of jets, deliveries have repeatedly been delayed, prompting some experts to question the effectiveness of the aid.\nWilliam Reno, professor and chair of the political science department at Northwestern University, told Newsweek earlier this month that delivery of the jets was unlikely to come at the \"optimal time,\" drawing a parallel with Kyiv receiving Western tanks after its fall 2022 counteroffensive.\n\"There's a tendency for weapon systems to arrive after the point at which they would have been most effective,\" said Reno. \"There was an optimal time for tanks... They were put to use when they arrived in 2023, but by then began to encounter drone attacks that exploited vulnerabilities in their armor and thus limited their utility.\"\n\"F-16s encounter a similar situation,\" he added. \"The length of the decision, training and delivery process have given Russian forces time to adapt air defenses, particularly as both sides settled into defensive positions.\"\nUpdate 5/30/24, 10:48 p.m. ET: This article has been updated to include comments from a U.S. State Department spokesperson.\n",

    "content": "Vice presidential contender South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem defended actions described in her upcoming book in which she killed a dog and goat on her family farm.\nAccording to an excerpt, which was obtained by the Guardian, Noem killed her dog Cricket because the dog was “untrainable,” “dangerous to anyone she came in contact with” and “less than worthless … as a hunting dog.”\n“I hated that dog,” Noem writes, according to the Guardian.\nIn the excerpt, Noem writes she attempted to tame the dog, who she said behaved “like a trained assassin,” with an electronic collar, but ultimately made the decision to put her down by shooting her in a gravel pit after an incident in which the dog attacked a local family’s chickens and bit her.\n“It was not a pleasant job,” Noem writes, according to the Guardian, “but it had to be done. And after it was over, I realized another unpleasant job needed to be done.”\nNext, the Guardian quotes excerpts of the book in which Noem shoots a goat in the same manner. Noem describes the goat as “nasty and mean” and having a “disgusting, musky, rancid” smell. The goat made a habit of chasing and knocking down her kids, Noem adds.\nAiming to distinguish herself from typical politicians, Noem writes, “I guess if I were a better politician I wouldn’t tell the story here.”\nPosting a picture of the Guardian article, Noem said that her actions were not unusual on a farm.\n“We love animals, but tough decisions like this happen all the time on a farm. Sadly, we just had to put down 3 horses a few weeks ago that had been in our family for 25 years. If you want more real, honest, and politically INcorrect stories that’ll have the media gasping, preorder ‘No Going Back,’” Noem posted Friday on X, sharing a link to her book.\nFollowing backlash surrounding the story, Noem on Sunday issued another statement defending her actions as lawful.\n“Whether running the ranch or in politics, I have never passed on my responsibilities to anyone else to handle. Even if it’s hard and painful. I followed the law and was being a responsible parent, dog owner, and neighbor,” Noem said in a post on X.\nIn her post, Noem pointed to a South Dakota law allowing for dogs that attack and kill other domestic animals to be killed.\n“The fact is, South Dakota law states that dogs who attack and kill livestock can be put down. Given that Cricket had shown aggressive behavior toward people by biting them, I decided what I did,” Noem said.\nNoem, a staunch Trump supporter, is one of several politicians whom Trump has acknowledged are on his running mate shortlist.\nEarlier in April, Noem told CNN’s Dana Bash that she would support Trump even if he is convicted in the New York hush money trial.\nAmid the speculation over her potential as Trump’s vice president continues, Noem would not say whether she would have certified the 2020 election if she were in the same position as former Vice President Mike Pence.\nShe tied for first choice in a February poll at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February in which attendees were asked who they’d like to see Trump pick as his running mate. Noem and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy each received 15% of votes in the straw poll.\nDuring the conference, the South Dakota governor took a crack at those who entered the 2024 Republican primary against Trump, suggesting they got into the race for “personal benefit” and “a spotlight for a period of time.”\n“I was one of the first people to endorse Donald J. Trump as president. Last year, when everyone was asking me if I was going to consider running for president, I said no. Why would you run for president if you can’t win?” Noem said.\nThis story has been updated with new information.\nCNN’s Shania Shelton contributed to this report.\n",

The pair appeared to be on good form, smiling and waving at well-wishers gathered nearby on arrival before being welcomed to the hospital by medical staff.\nCamilla, 76, has been president of cancer care and support charity Maggie’s since 2008.\nThe King has largely remained out of the public eye during his treatment so far, apart from an outing on Easter Sunday when he delighted crowds with an impromptu walkabout after attending church with several family members.\nTuesday’s visit to University College Hospital Macmillan Cancer Centre was to reiterate the value of early diagnosis and focus attention on some of the innovative research taking place there.\nThe King has been refreshingly open about his health, particularly in comparison to his predecessors. His first major public engagement since his diagnosis is very much a continuation of his desire to raise awareness and encourage the public to seek advice if they notice any possible symptoms.\nHe leaned on his own recent personal experience when talking to medical teams as well as while connecting with patients and their families on Tuesday.\nWhile being given a tour of the medical unit, which supports the identification and treatment of a wide range of cancer conditions, he was shown how CT scanners are helping with early detection. During his visit, he frequently asked questions and made comments about the importance of early diagnosis.\nLater, he sat down with several cancer patients including Lesley Woodbridge, who was receiving chemotherapy as the monarch stopped by. While chatting, he told her, “I’ve got to have my treatment this afternoon as well,” according to the UK’s PA Media news agency. Charles himself has been receiving unspecified outpatient treatment over the last three months.\nThe King’s outing came as he was announced as the new patron of Cancer Research UK. While at the center, he was due to meet with the organization’s chief clinician, Charlie Swanton, who has led a project called TRACERx, which is focused on lung cancer.\n• Sign up to CNN’s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on the royal family, what they are up to in public and what’s happening behind palace walls.\nWhile Buckingham Palace announced on Friday that the King had been given the green light to resume public duties, it will be a cautious return.\nA palace spokesperson that the King was “greatly encouraged to be resuming some public-facing duties and very grateful to his medical team for their continued care and expertise.”\nThe palace also said that forthcoming events would be adapted where necessary to minimize any risks to his convalescence.\nThe palace did not specify how many engagements were being added to the King’s diary or whether he would be able to attend his birthday parade in London or the D-Day 80th anniversary commemorations in Normandy in June.\nHowever, it has been confirmed that he will welcome Japan’s Emperor and Empress for a state visit later that month.\nThis story has been updated with further developments.\n",

    "content": "Editor's note: This column is part of 'Why Do We?' — a weekly video series hosted by culture expert Martin Lindstrom that untangles unique quirks of human behavior. Click here for the full series page.\nWhen the iPhone came out in 2005, I wasn't among the first in line, but I did buy one. Two weeks later, surprised that my new device was doing exactly what it was designed to do—addicting me—I replaced it with a no-frills Nokia, which I used for the next thirteen years.\nThen, on January 15, 2018, I put my Nokia in a drawer forever. Why? Because I'm haunted by the image of myself looking at my phone to the exclusion of everything else around me. Mostly I remember resenting that a cartoonish cube of metal and glass had taken control of my life. The \"endless and proper work\" of paying attention is an essential part of the work I do. Why would I use something that compromised my ability to be great at my job?\nEven though I'm currently in my sixth year without a phone, I decided to reach out to Nir Eyal, named by The M.I.T. Technology Review as, \"The Prophet of Habit-Forming Technology,\" to try to get to the bottom of phone addiction and understand why we check our phones even though we haven't received any notifications.\nEyal is the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products and Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life, selling over 1 million copies in over 30 languages.\nThe conversation proved fascinating — despite our differences, I was amazed to find an astounding number of similarities. I also came away having learned a few tricks that I still use to this day.\nSay, for example, you're at a business dinner and one of the patrons is constantly looking down at their phone. Instead of ignoring them, Nir's strategy is to confront them with concern: ask them in a sincere way: \"I can see that you're on the phone a lot – is everything okay – is there anything I can do to help?\"\nAs we dug deeper towards the root question that inspired our sit down, Nir's explanations brought me back to my own decision to get rid of my phone. Our phones are a form of armor. A shield. A light saber. A one-handed defense against our own fear, anxiety, aloneness, self-consciousness, stillness, sadness, and insignificance. A notification means someone cares. It means that we're important.\nI get it.\nAnd yet, when I'm walking along the street and someone glued to his or her phone crashes into me, followed by a quick, rueful \"Sorry...\" I can't help feeling an irrational rage. \"Don't you understand what you're doing?\" I want to say. Is this really how you want to spend your one wild and precious life?\n",

    "content": "NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has uncovered an unprecedented collection of ancient supernovae.\nAstronomers announced that they found 10 times more of these stellar explosions than were previously known to have existed in the early days of the universe. Some of these 80-ish newly discovered supernovae exploded when the universe was only around 2 billion years old—the universe today is about 13.8 billion years old—making them some of the oldest ever found.\n\"Webb is a supernova discovery machine,\" Christa DeCoursey, a third-year graduate student at the Steward Observatory and the University of Arizona in Tucson, said in a NASA statement. \"The sheer number of detections plus the great distances to these supernovae are the two most exciting outcomes from our survey.\"\nSupernovae are enormous explosions that occur when a star dies. They send out huge amounts of energy as the star's core collapses in on itself when it runs out of fuel. These supernovae often leave behind black holes or neutron stars when the original star is large or white dwarfs for smaller stars.\nThe JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) astronomers found these new supernovae within a minuscule patch of sky, the equivalent of the thickness of a grain of rice held at arm's length.\n\"Because Webb is so sensitive, it's finding supernovae and other transients almost everywhere it's pointed,\" JADES team member Eiichi Egami, a research professor at the University of Arizona in Tucson, said in the statement. \"This is the first significant step toward more extensive surveys of supernovae with Webb.\"\nThe astronomers detected these ancient supernovas thanks to a phenomenon known as cosmological redshift, which is where the light from distant galaxies appears more red than it should be. This occurs because the universe is expanding, causing the space between galaxies to stretch. Light stretches in a way that makes it shift toward the red end of the spectrum—because red light has a longer wavelength than blue light—meaning that when astronomers observe light from distant galaxies, they see this redshift, which tells them that those galaxies are moving away from us due to the expansion of the universe.\n\"This is really our first sample of what the high-redshift universe looks like for transient science,\" Justin Pierel, a NASA Einstein Fellow at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, Maryland, said in the statement. \"We are trying to identify whether distant supernovae are fundamentally different from or very much like what we see in the nearby universe.\"\nThe JWST's discovery of these 80 new supernovae was revealed by astronomers from the JADES program in a press conference at the 244th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Madison, Wisconsin. Before the JWST was launched, only a few supernovae had been discovered to have a redshift value that corresponded to having existed when the universe was younger than around 3.3 billion years old\nOne of the newly discovered supernovae exploded when the universe was only 1.8 billion years old, making it the furthest and, therefore, oldest ever found.\nThe astronomers are particularly interested in types of supernovae known as Type Ia supernovae, which have a predictable intense brightness. This means that they can be used to calculate the expansion rate of the universe using redshift. In this recent finding, they discovered at least one Type Ia supernova from when the universe was 2.3 billion years old, making it the oldest known Type Ia supernova. This may help scientists study if the brightness of these supernovae changes with redshift, which would impact their ability to be reliable predictors of the universe's expansion rate.\nThese findings may also help astronomers study how supernovae in the early universe were different from those of today and how this might have affected the formation of early stars and planets.\n\"We're essentially opening a new window on the transient universe,\" STScI Fellow Matthew Siebert, lead of the spectroscopic analysis of the JADES supernovae, said in the statement. \"Historically, whenever we've done that, we've found extremely exciting things — things that we didn't expect.\"\nDo you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?

    "content": "Gen Z has been largely left out of Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness options this year, and many are struggling to pay off their monthly payments as they navigate low starting salaries and economic uncertainty.\nRead more: Student Loan Forgiveness Updates and FAQs\nGen Z—born from 1997-2012—graduated during an uncertain job market, with many entering the workforce right when the pandemic upended companies and shifted to a remote work culture. At the same time, the generation has faced some of the highest educational costs, with the average college tuition and fees at a four-year school costing $19,806 per year during the 2021-2022 school year.\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Gen Z has an average of $20,900 in student debt, which is 13 percent higher than millennials. That translates to a median loan of $12,800, which again is around 14 percent higher than that of millennials.\nDespite these factors, the Department of Education has not included Gen Z in most of the student loan relief options available to federal borrowers.\nBiden's current relief initiatives target those who took out loans more than 20 or 25 years ago or those who have worked in public service for 10 or more years.\nAltogether, Biden has canceled almost $160 billion for 4.6 million borrowers, but the majority of that relief comes after years of making loan payments, making Gen Z ineligible since they only recently graduated college or are still attending.\nMichael Lux, an attorney and the founder of the Student Loan Sherpa, said the majority of student debt relief has gone to older borrowers, but it was for a specific reason.\nRead more: Compare 12 of the Best Refinance Student Loans\n\"I'd also say that it is intentional. For many years, borrowers received lousy advice from loan servicers and the Biden fixes have attempted to fix these issues,\" Lux told Newsweek.\nOther times, loan relief went out to borrowers who attended misleading for-profit schools. Most recently, Biden passed $6.1 billion in student debt cancellation for the 317,000 borrowers who attended The Art Institutes.\nThis relief came as the organization \"falsified data, knowingly misled students, and cheated borrowers into taking on mountains of debt without leading to promising career prospects at the end of their studies,\" Biden said.\nThe institution closed its campuses last year after facing fraud accusations, and now everyone who attended The Art Institutes between January 1, 2004, and October 16, 2017, is eligible for forgiveness.\nNot all of Biden's attempts to cancel student debt have been fruitful, though. His administration initially passed $430 billion in student debt forgiveness, but the Supreme Court struck down the policy last year.\nUnder that policy, Biden would have seen more than 40 million Americans benefit, including many Gen Z-ers. The program hoped to offer $10,000 in relief to all borrowers earning less than $125,000. All borrowers who were Pell Grant recipients and came from a low-income background qualified for $20,000 in relief.\nStill, Gen Z is bound to benefit from Biden's loan forgiveness—it just might not be as immediate.\nThe new SAVE plan the Education Department has offered will see many Gen Z-ers get lower student loan bills monthly, if not full forgiveness down the line.\nUnder SAVE, borrowers will have their monthly payments calculated based on their income and family size, with many remaining balances forgiven after several years. Via the new repayment plan, monthly payments range from 5 to 10 percent of a borrower's discretionary income.\nBut none of the relief available negates the overarching problem that has led to the student loan forgiveness policies, Lux said.\nRead more: When Is the FAFSA Deadline?\n\"Ultimately, the root problem with student loans is that college is too expensive,\" Lux said. \"The forgiveness programs help people impacted by this issue, but it does nothing to lower the cost of college.\"\nAs Gen Z waits it out, many might feel tempted to forego their loan payments until another large-scale debt relief plan comes their way, but this would be a mistake, according to Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor at the University of Tennessee at Martin.\n\"It looks like Gen Z student loan holders will mostly have to wait to take advantage of forgiveness programs until 10 years or more after the start of their payments, but they should wait with caution and still make their monthly payments,\" Beene told Newsweek. \"There's no guarantee there will be forgiveness plans down the line, and avoiding your student loan payments will have long-term financial repercussions on their credit score.\"\n",

Despite multiple consultations with doctors over the years, Bravo's skin condition continues to worsen, leaving her and her TikTok followers desperate for answers.\n\"In 2018, I went to Tamarindo, Costa Rica, and on my third day, I woke up with a mild cough and some congestion,\" Bravo told Newsweek. \"When I got home, I noticed a few red bumps on my arm that looked like bug bites.\" Initially diagnosed as sand fly bites, Bravo's condition has worsened over the years despite multiple consultations with various doctors.\nBravo first sought medical advice shortly after returning home. The doctor she visited suggested cryotherapy, but the red bumps remained. In 2019, a dermatologist dismissed the condition as minor bug bites that would resolve on their own. However, the bumps persisted and worsened. Another dermatologist performed a biopsy in 2020, which also concluded they were bug bites that would disappear on their own. The only thing the doctor suggested was a chemical peel for scarring, which Bravo declined.\nThroughout this period, Bravo consulted several other doctors, all of whom were unsure about the condition but assured her it was not dangerous. In 2022, during a pregnancy, her OB-GYN also reviewed her biopsy results and confirmed the condition would not affect her baby, but also apologized for not being able to tell her what it was.\nThe situation took a frustrating turn in May of this year when Bravo's primary care physician quickly diagnosed her with eczema without carrying out any additional tests on her. \"She prescribed me Triamcinolone Acetonide Ointment USP 0.5%,\" Bravo said. \"I have not used or plan to use it without proper diagnosis confirmed by proper testing.\"\nDr. Salar Hazany, a board-certified dermatologist at the Scar Healing Institute of Beverly Hills, told Newsweek: \"I have not seen or diagnosed this patient, but it looks like this woman might have sporotrichosis, which is caused by a prick from a thorn of a plant, likely a rose plant. Other exotic fungi and bacteria can have sporotrichoid spread. They are hard to culture and see in biopsy.\"\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) previously wrote that sporotrichosis is an infection under the skin caused by different species of the fungus Sporothrix, which occurs sporadically in tropical and subtropical countries.\nSporotrichosis can be transmitted through plant debris or through animal transmission, such as scratches from cats. WHO added that its diagnosis depends on demonstrating fungal scrapings or curettings from lesions or biopsy material.\nDr. Hazany recommended itraconazole for treatment, noting that a skin biopsy may not easily reveal the organisms causing sporotrichosis. \"The definitive diagnostic method is fungal tissue culture, which generally provides results within 3-5 days,\" he added.\nBravo has tried various remedies, including tea tree oil, castor oil, and even a parasite cleanse, all suggested by her supportive TikTok community, where she originally shared the post in April under the username cynlza. She plans to continue advocating for a thorough diagnosis and proper treatment.\n\"Many of my TikTok followers have suggested lots of possibilities and remedies,\" Bravo said. \"The TikTok community has been very supportive, and thousands are now following my journey as we all want to know what is on or in my arm.\"\nBravo's determination highlights the challenges many face in the healthcare system, especially when dealing with persistent, undiagnosed conditions. Her story underscores the importance of advocating for oneself and seeking multiple opinions when faced with medical uncertainty.\nThe video quickly went viral on social media, getting viewers from across TikTok. It has so far received over 962,200 views and 23,500 likes on the platform.\nDo you have funny and adorable videos or pictures you want to share?

    "content": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.\nFor decades, Western companies made a fortune betting on the inexorable rise of the Chinese consumer. Now an economic slump and the emergence of ferocious local competitors means those bets look less safe as price wars erupt.\nDiscounts and special deals are being offered across consumer brands from food and clothing to consumer electronics and cars, reflecting a dramatic shift in consumption patterns in the world’s second largest economy.\nOne of the most intense price wars is raging in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, where a “life and death” race has manufacturers scrambling for survival.\nTesla’s China market share shrank to 4% in April, almost halving from 7.7% in March, according to data released by the China Passenger Car Association on Friday. Deliveries from its Shanghai factory, its largest globally, fell 18% last month from a year earlier.\nThe sharp drop contrasts with rising sales by its biggest Chinese rival BYD, which reported a 29% jump in pure EV deliveries.\n“Everyone has changed the way they think about China,” said Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder and managing principal at J Capital Research. “The business climate has changed entirely.”\nLast month, Tesla (TSLA) announced aggressive price cuts in the country, shortly after also reducing prices in the United States and Germany. The move added to a series of price reductions that it has made in its biggest overseas market since late 2022.\nLast year, the Chinese economy grew 5.2%. Outside the pandemic years, that was its slowest pace of annual expansion since 1990, when gross domestic product increased only 3.9% because of international sanctions following the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.\nConsumers have curtailed spending as their job and income prospects worsened. A prolonged crisis in real estate, which accounts for 70% of household wealth, and a stock market meltdown have added to their woes.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk makes a surprise visit to China, it coincides with Beijing's auto show where reports suggest he is trying to export his company's self-driving technology. CNN's Marc Stewart has more.\n\nRelated video\nElon Musk makes surprise visit to China, meets senior trade officials\nIn the 1990s, “every company in the West” was hiring consultants and having boardroom meetings about how to do more in China, according to Stevenson-Yang. But now the consultants are gone and rather than talking about how to tap into rapid growth, the C-suite discussions are all about “getting out, protecting one’s operations or balancing supply among several countries.”\n“China now is somewhere around the status of a Brazil — big, important but difficult,” she added.\nThe country’s economic woes aren’t confined to Tesla and the EV industry either. They’re hitting other American corporate giants like Apple (AAPL), Starbucks (STUX) and McDonald’s (MCD): all struggling to adjust their business strategies for a rapidly changing market.\nWorries about the future have forced Chinese consumers to be more budget-conscious, said Yang Wang, senior analyst for Counterpoint Research. As a result, purchases associated with premium or luxury have taken a back seat.\n“Certainly Chinese consumers are experiencing ‘downgraded consumption’ in general,” he said.\nApple’s overall revenue in Greater China — including mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao — fell 8% to $16.4 billion in the fiscal quarter ending March 30.\nMeanwhile, Huawei, a Chinese tech champion that the West once tried to kill off, has been advancing rapidly. Its smartphone sales soared 70% in the first quarter of 2024, boosted by the successful launch of its Mate 60 series, according to data compiled by Counterpoint Research.\nRelated article\nHuawei sales are soaring in China as Apple sinks\n“[China] is the most competitive market in the world,” said Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, at an earnings call with analysts earlier this month. He added that he continues to feel optimistic about the Chinese market in the long term.\nThe US smartphone maker has cut prices for iPhones sold in China, which helped its shipments jump in March, according to data published last week by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, a government-backed research firm. It marked a turnaround from the previous two months of 2024, when Apple saw a deep slump in iPhone sales.\nThe price reductions were led by Apple and third-party retailing platforms, with some iPhone 15 models offered at discounts of as much as 20%.\nCoffee chains have also scrambled to undercut each other’s prices. Last February, Cotti Coffee, a startup founded by two former Luckin Coffee executives, began a campaign to slash latte prices to as low as 9.9 yuan ($1.4).\nThe move prompted Luckin, which is the country’s largest coffee chain, to match that price. Cotti then slashed latte prices again to 8.8 yuan ($1.2).\nThe aggressive discounts have affected global brands. Even Starbucks, which had signalled it had no interest in a price war in China, started offering coupons that effectively lowered its latte prices to below 20 yuan ($2.8). They normally sell for 30 yuan ($4.2).\nRelated article\nIn China’s battle of the lattes, Luckin Coffee keeps beating Starbucks\nThe average check paid by a Starbucks customer declined 9% in China in the first quarter of the year, mainly because of promotions and lower sales of higher priced merchandise, the company said.\n“Our consumers are now more cautious in their spending,” said Belinda Wong, chairwoman and co-CEO of Starbucks China, on an earnings call in January. “You see mass influx of mass market competitors focus on fast store expansion and low price tactics to drive trial.”\nFast food chains have also gotten into the act.\n“Poor man’s deal” has become a trending term among Chinese youth since 2022. It initially referred to McDonald’s “1+1 = 13.9-yuan pair as you wish” $1.90 set meal, which was extremely popular among customers.\nOther Western fast food chains have subsequently jumped on the bandwagon, launching their own low-price set meals.\nOnline guides for getting weekly fast food discounts have gone viral on social media.\n“Mondays at McDonalds for free McNuggets, Tuesdays at Tastien for a ‘one-for-one’ offer, Wednesdays at Dominos for 30% off, Thursdays at KFC for the ‘crazy Thursday’ deal, Fridays at Burger King for a half-priced weekday set deal, then heading to Wallace for the weekends. Repeat next week,” according to one guide.\nNanchengxiang, a Beijing-based fast food chain, has even launched an ultra-cheap “ 3 yuan (41 cents) breakfast buffet,” setting a record low price for all you can eat meals.\nThe set, dubbed by many netizens as “a must-have for poor people working in Beijing,” has more than doubled sales during breakfast hours, according to canyin168, a data tracking and analytical website in the catering industry.\nThe “depressed” consumer sentiment is likely to stay for a while, said Yang from Counterpoint Research.\nSome Western brands “inevitably” will be forced to reconsider pricing to defend market share.\nHowever, that will be “no easy fix,” as foreign brands are at a disadvantage vis-a-vis domestic brands due to higher operating costs, he added.\nRelated article\nChina will focus on ‘high-quality, sustainable growth,’ central bank chief says\nHe doesn’t think they’re likely to pull out of the country though.\nOver the medium to long term, China is still set to drive global economic growth and contribute to the largest growing cohort of middle-class consumers.\n“With depressed economic prospects in most developed countries, and still some catching up to do for key emerging market growth markets like India, China could still offer the most lucrative market globally, even with depressed consumption levels,” he said.\nBut expectations will have to be lowered.\n“I think the fundamental mistake that many Western companies made in China was to believe in the myth of a rising middle class,” said Stevenson-Yang.\n“In reality, Chinese people had a ton of money from capital gains in real estate and the stock market; They never had big increases in income. The economy is not reverting to the poverty levels of the 1980s, but there is a lot of dialing back being done.”\n",

    "content": "President Joe Biden went on “The Howard Stern Show” on Friday and repeated his familiar story about the time he supposedly “got arrested” trying to defend the civil rights of Black Americans.\nAs in the past, Biden told the story on Friday while recounting what his mother supposedly said while urging him to accept Barack Obama’s 2008 offer to be his running mate. His mom, he said, did not want him to turn down a man who was vying to become the first Black president.\nBiden told Stern: “She said, ‘Joey, let me — remember’ — true story, she said —  ‘Remember when they were desegregating Lynnfield, the neighborhood … suburbia — and I told you — and there was a Black family moving in and there was — people were down there protesting; I told you not to go down there and you went down, remember that? And you got arrested standing on the porch with a Black family? And they brought you back, the police?’ And I said, ‘Yeah, Mom, I remember that.’”\nFacts First: There is no evidence Biden ever got arrested during a civil rights protest, as The Washington Post and PolitiFact found when they looked into this claim in 2022 — and Biden has at least twice told the story of his supposed presence at this particular Delaware protest without mentioning any arrest, instead claiming that the police merely took him home that day.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.\nThe Post noted that in the version of the story Biden told during a public conversation with Oprah Winfrey late in the 2020 presidential campaign, he said the police escorted him home from the protest because they thought he would get in trouble; he did not say they arrested him.\nThe Post reported that he told Winfrey his mother said: “And there were people protesting and I told you not to go down there and you went down and the police brought you back because you were standing on the step with the Black family.You were standing with them. And the police brought you home because they thought you’d get in trouble.” He told Winfrey that he responded, “Yeah, Mom, I remember that.”\nAs the Post and PolitiFact also noted, Biden’s 2017 memoir included an abbreviated version of the story about his mother’s 2008 comments urging him to accept Obama’s running mate offer, but it made no mention of an arrest. No other Biden memoir, either, says he was arrested at such a protest.\nThe Post and PolitiFact did find that there were protests roughly matching Biden’s description in early 1959, when Biden was 16 years old, in communities not far from Biden’s home in Delaware. Crowds protested against a Black couple that had bought a home in a previously all-White community and against the realtor who sold it to them.\nBut the Wilmington News Journal reported that the four teenagers arrested at the protest at the couple’s home were arrested for possessing fireworks — and that all seven of the arrests that day were of people in the anti-integration crowd outside the home. The newspaper reported that the police on scene were defending the home and the Black couple. It also quoted one member of the couple as saying, “Nobody’s behind us.”\nIt’s impossible to definitively prove whether or not Biden was present at this protest or any similar protest 60-plus years ago. (Biden’s mother died in 2010.)\nPrevious false claims\nBiden has made a series of false claims about his personal past in the last two weeks. They include the false claim that he “used to drive an 18-wheeler” and the false claim that he has never earned $400,000 in a year.\nAnd while running for president in 2020, Biden claimed he was “arrested” as a US senator as he tried to visit South African anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela while Mandela was imprisoned. After media outlets found no evidence of such an arrest, Biden told CNN that he had been “stopped” in South Africa but did not mean to say arrested.\n",

    "content": "Michael Cohen implicated his former boss Donald Trump in the hush money scheme to pay Stormy Daniels just days before the 2016 election, saying he doled out $130,000 at Trump’s direction and was promised reimbursement.\nCohen’s testimony ties together the prosecution’s allegations that Trump broke the law by falsifying business records to reimburse Cohen and conceal the hush money payment that Cohen said he made at Trump’s direction. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies having an affair with Daniels.\nRelated live-story\nMichael Cohen testifies in Trump hush money trial\nCohen and Trump mostly avoided eye contact while he testified Monday. Cohen looked directly at prosecutor Susan Hoffinger throughout most of his testimony, occasionally scanning the room or looking in the jury’s direction. Trump spent long stretches of Cohen’s questioning with his eyes closed or thumbing through a stack of news stories.\nTrump’s attorneys are likely to get their chance to question Cohen on Tuesday. Trump attorney Todd Blanche is expected to try to shred Cohen’s credibility with the jury during cross-examination by painting him as a convicted perjurer who has changed his story more than once.\nHere are the takeaways from Day 16 of the Trump hush money trial:\nThrough roughly five hours of testimony Monday, Cohen walked jurors through how he worked with former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker on Trump’s behalf during the 2016 campaign to kill negative stories; how he kept Trump apprised of his hush money negotiations with Keith Davidson, the attorney for Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal; and how Trump approved and was aware of how Cohen would be falsely repaid in 2017 for the Daniels payment as legal services.\nCohen is the glue that brings together the other witnesses the jurors have heard from so far, connected through text message email and phone calls to Pecker, Davidson, Dylan Howard, Hope Hicks and others who were allegedly involved with the hush money payments.\nCohen described his conversations with Trump during the Daniels hush money negotiations, which prosecutors backed up using Cohen’s phone records to show when the two had spoken. He also connected the payment to Trump’s campaign.\n“I had to get this done,” Cohen said on the stand.  “This would be catastrophic to the campaign.”\nAfter Cohen and Davidson agreed to a $130,000 settlement payment on October 11, 2016, Cohen said he tried to drag out the process until after the election at Trump’s direction – claiming he would need 10 days to get the money together and noting that the office was closed on Yom Kippur.\nHoffinger asked why Cohen did that.\n“Because after the election, it wouldn’t matter,” Cohen said.\n“According to who?” Hoffinger asked.\n“Mr. Trump,” Cohen said.\nDaniels got fed up with the delays, leading to Davidson briefly canceling the settlement agreement, before they renewed the deal at the end of October.\nThe day before Cohen wired the money, he had two calls with Trump the morning in which he said he told Trump he was going to open the account for the LLC that would wire the money to Daniels.\n“I wanted to ensure that once again he approved what I was doing because I require approval from him on all of this,” Cohen said.\nHoffinger asked whether Cohen would have gone to the bank without Trump’s approval.\n“No,” Cohen said. “Everything required Mr. Trump’s sign-off; on top of that, I wanted the money back.”\nCohen described how he lied on his bank statements – lies that led to federal charges against him in 2018 – by saying that Essential Consultants LLC was being used for real estate consulting.\nWhen asked whether his bank would have opened the account had he been truthful, Cohen said, “I believe that they probably would not.”\nTrump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records – 11 invoices, 12 vouchers and 11 checks – records that prosecutors say stem from the monthly reimbursements Cohen received in 2017 for the hush money payment he made to Daniels.\nOn Monday, jurors heard through Cohen for the first time evidence directly connecting Trump to those reimbursements.\nCohen described how he was furious in December 2016 when his annual Christmas bonus had been cut by two-thirds.\nHe said he immediately went to Trump’s then-chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, “and in some colorful language expressed to him how truly pissed off and angry I really was. This makes no sense at all.”\n“I was even for myself unusually angry,” Cohen said. “I used quite a few expletives.”\nAfter the new year, Cohen said he went to Weisselberg about getting repaid for the $130,000 payment. “Let’s do it,” he said Weisselberg told him.\nThe jury was then shown Cohen’s First Republic bank statement, which showed the $130,000 settlement payment and Weisselberg’s handwriting detailing how Cohen should be repaid $420,000.\nRelated article\nRudy Guiliani’s radio show has been cancelled after he repeatedly discussed false 2020 election conspiracy theories\nCohen testified that he saw Weisselberg write on the document, while telling jurors that his money would be “grossed up” to account for taxes, because he was being paid in monthly installments as income, instead of as a reimbursement.\nImportantly, Cohen said that after their meeting, he and Weisselberg went to Trump’s office to speak to him about it. Cohen said he was given the title of personal attorney to the president around the same time but wasn’t going to be paid for that title.\nHoffinger asked whether he was being paid for future legal services.\n“That was what it was designed to be,” Cohen said.\n“What was it actually?” Hoffinger asked.\n“Reimbursement of my money,” Cohen said.\nCohen, who used to say he’d take a bullet for Trump in the height of their relationship, testified Monday about everything he did to protect his former boss.\nAs Cohen described each media story he killed and nondisclosure agreement he locked down ahead of the 2016 election, it was always in the name of protecting Trump.\nWhen it came to the settlement agreement with Daniels, Cohen said he kept control of a document revealing the identities of “David Dennison” and “Peggy Peterson” so that he could protect Trump.\nAnd he testified that he used the Essential Consultants LLC to facilitate the payment to Daniels “to protect him and to isolate him from the transaction.”\nHoffinger asked Cohen whether he would sometimes bully people. Cohen confirmed he would.\n“The only thing that was on my mind was to accomplish the task to make him happy,” Cohen said of Trump.\nCohen also testified that it’s “fair” to say he was once Trump’s “fixer” and told the jury he’d sometimes lie for Trump – including to his own wife.\nCohen said he opted to front the $130,000 to Daniels from his home equity line of credit on his personal property because his wife would’ve noticed the large sum missing from their joint personal bank account.\nCohen painted Trump – whom he often called “boss” – as a micromanager who insisted he be kept informed of the ongoings of any situation, including the more discreet instances like the nondisclosure agreements with McDougal and Daniels.\nCohen admitted he also kept Trump constantly informed because he wanted credit for handling Trump’s matters, whether it was negotiating invoices or suppressing negative media stories.\nCohen said he always wanted Trump to know situations were handled and he wanted “to get credit for accomplishing the task.”\nUnlike his typical public persona, the jury saw a subdued Cohen who gave slow and deliberate answers on direct examination.\nCohen rarely looked over at Trump sitting at the defense table, training his eyes mostly on the prosecutor questioning him.\nAnd aside from reviewing some documents and passing a few notes to his attorneys, Trump spent the majority of the day with his eyes closed. The former president glanced up at Cohen a few times, but there was never an obvious moment of eye contact.\nCohen did prompt a few headshakes of what looked like disapproval from Trump, including when Cohen mentioned Trump’s wife, Melania.\nCohen claimed Trump wasn’t worried about his wife’s feelings when the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape went public before the election – testimony contrary to what former Trump aides Hicks and Madeleine Westerhout told the jury.\nHe testified, “‘Don’t worry, he goes, ‘How long do you think I’ll be on the market for? Not long.’ He wasn’t thinking about Melania. This was all about the campaign.”\nAt one point, it seemed like Trump had heard enough of Cohen’s devoted-employee story, shaking his head with a pursed-lipped smile when Cohen testified that he used a shell company to pay Daniels to protect Trump.\nTrump shook his head with a sarcastic smile when Cohen admitted he was disappointed he wasn’t considered for chief of staff when Trump took office.\nThroughout the four weeks of the trial, Trump has looked to having supporters at court – both on the streets outside of the Manhattan courthouse and within the confines of Judge Juan Merchan’s courtroom – and has complained about not having more support.\nLast week, Trump’s son Eric Trump; his senior campaign adviser, Susie Wiles; and Sen. Rick Scott of Florida all appeared in the gallery behind the former president.\nOn Monday, Trump had his biggest entourage of GOP lawmakers yet – including potential vice presidential hopefuls.\nSens. J.D. Vance of Ohio and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama were in court, as was New York Rep. Nicole Malliotakis from Trump-friendly Staten Island, and the attorneys general of Alabama and Iowa.\nThey joined Trump for the high-profile Cohen testimony, sitting in the gallery behind the former president at the defendant’s table. Eric Trump and attorney Alina Habba were also there to support Trump.\nThe Republican politicians stood behind Trump while he gave his new conference before entering the courtroom Monday morning. And after the first break of the morning, they went outside to give their own account to the cameras to denounce the proceedings they had just witnessed.\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n",

    "content": "Mike Tyson is clearly taking his fight with Jake Paul seriously as he detailed elements of his training regime, which he says includes not smoking marijuana as well as abstaining from sex.\nTyson, 57, will return to the ring to face YouTuber-turned-boxer Paul at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas on July 20. Tyson will be 58 when the fight takes place.\n“Two and a half weeks, I haven’t smoked,” Tyson told “The Damon Elliott Show.” “And I haven’t had sex for two and a half weeks.” Tyson was pictured with Elliott in an April 12 post on the latter’s Instagram, with the caption saying: “Thanks for coming to my show today!”\nHowever, in a separate interview with Forbes Life on April 20, Tyson said his regime of abstinence had been longer, saying: “Probably for six weeks I haven’t gotten high or had sex.”\n“I’m living my life disciplined now, so I’m going to have to fight disciplined now,” he added.\nMarijuana is on the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation’s (TDLR) banned substances list. The TDLR governs combat sport in the state.\nCNN has reached out to Tyson for comment.\nOn Monday, the TDLR told CNN that it had approved a professional bout with certain waivers, meaning the fight will last for eight rounds, with two minutes a round and both boxers wearing 14-ounce gloves.\n“Iron Mike” last fought professionally in June 2005 and boasts a 50-6 career record, with 44 of his victories coming by way of knockout. The former world heavyweight champion is widely considered one of the best boxers in history.\nHe last fought in 2020, coming out of retirement to face Roy Jones Jr. in an exhibition match which ended in a controversial split draw.\nIn the lead up to the fight against Paul at the 80,000-seat capacity AT&T Stadium, home of the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys, Tyson showed his effort to get into fighting shape after years out of the ring, notably shedding his top during multiple appearances to show off his physique.\nThe 27-year-old Paul has transitioned from YouTube to professional boxing and has won nine of his 10 fights. His only defeat came against Tommy Fury, the younger half-brother of heavyweight champion Tyson Fury, in February 2023.\nSmoking marijuana has been a constant in Tyson’s life ever since he first tried it from a young age, the 57-year-old says in the interview with Forbes Life.\nHis victory over Andrew Golota in 2000 was voided after Tyson’s boxing license in Michigan was suspended and fined following a post-fight urine sample that tested positive for marijuana.\nThe 57-year-old has also started his own cannabis brand, Tyson 2.0, with Forbes estimating it generated $150 million in revenue last year.\nThe brand sells edibles in the shape of Evander Holyfield’s half-bitten ear, a nod to the controversial 1997 fight between the two heavyweights, as well as other products named after Tyson’s successful boxing career. The edible was part of a joint venture alongside Holyfield.\nTyson credits his wife, Lakiha Spicer, for coming up with the idea of selling products to recognize that moment in the fight against Holyfield – he later served a one-year boxing ban. The edibles are named ‘Mike Bites.’\n“My wife is a nut, but she’s brilliant,” Tyson told Forbes. “And [one day] she said: ‘Why don’t you use the ear?’”\nAlthough Tyson described the incident as “the worst night of my professional career as a boxer, “it has proven to be a lucrative business moment.\n“Why did God, the universe, whatever we believe, why am I the face of it?” Tyson said. “An uneducated guy, Mike Tyson, why am I the face of cannabis and psychedelics? Why me? I can’t even spell cannabis and psychedelics.”\nTyson added: “I was the champ of the world and now I’m the champ in cannabis.”\n",

    "content": "Two polls have suggested Donald Trump will lose the presidential election, in the latest swing in what has been a tight race so far.\nIn March, the former leader and the incumbent President Joe Biden won enough primary races to secure, respectively, the Republican and Democratic nominations in the 2024 presidential election. Polls have so far shown that the results will be tight as the pair are statistically tied in most surveys or enjoying only marginal leads.\nHowever, two recent polls have suggested Trump is now lagging, marginally. In one poll of 1,046 adults by Florida Atlantic University and Mainstreet Research, 40 percent of all voters said they would vote for Biden and 38 percent would choose Trump in a race in which independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was included.\nWhen only likely voters were polled, 44 percent said they would vote for Biden and 39 percent for Trump.\nThe poll also found that in a two-person race where likely voters were polled, 47 percent would vote for Biden and 46 percent would vote for Trump.\nHowever in a two-person race when all voters were polled, Trump and Biden were tied with 44 percent of the vote each.\nThe poll was conducted between April 26 and April 28. The margin of error is +/- 3 percent.\nMeanwhile, a Reuters/Ipsos poll of 856 registered voters, which closed on Tuesday, found that 40 percent of registered voters would vote for Biden compared with 39 percent who would vote for Trump. However, the one percent lead is down from a four-point lead Biden had in a poll conducted by Reuters/Ipsos earlier in the month.\nThe survey has a 3 percentage point margin of error.\nNewsweek contacted Trump's campaign representative by email to comment on this story.\nMeanwhile, other recent polls have shown Trump is in the lead.\nA CNN poll of 1,212 people conducted by SSRS, an independent research company, between April 18 and 23 found that 49 percent of registered voters supported Trump, while 43 percent supported Biden, for instance.\nAn April poll by Bloomberg News and Morning Consult also indicated that Trump was polling ahead in six key swing states, by 6 points overall.\nAs these swing states may determine the result of the election, these polls are arguably more important than national polls.\nThomas Gift, who heads the Centre on U.S. Politics at University College London, previously told Newsweek that reading too much into polls was \"a fool's errand.\"\n\"Polls are so variable at this point that the only consistent insight we can glean from them is that Biden and Trump are neck and neck—not only nationally but in key swing states,\" he said. \"Trying to read too much into any one poll, or even set of polls, five months out from the election is a fool's errand.\"\nThe presidential election will take place on November 5.\n",

    "content": "Maryland Representative Jamie Raskin said that U.S. Supreme Court justices could be removed from former President Donald Trump's presidential immunity ruling by petition of the Justice Department.\nRaskin's theory, written in an op-ed published by The New York Times on Wednesday, follows the recent controversy involving Justice Samuel Alito, who was caught flying two flags outside of his residences that are associated with the \"Stop the Steal\" movement and the riots at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.\nIn response, several critics have called for Alito, a conservative, to remove himself from the high court's ruling on Trump's immunity case, who is seeking protection from federal charges related to his actions in the aftermath of the 2020 election through presidential immunity, as well as any cases related to January 6 that comes before the court.\nConservative Justice Clarence Thomas has also faced calls to recuse himself from such rulings due to his wife's actions related to the January 6 attack. Both Alito and Thomas have also accepted lavish gifts from GOP donors in the past, a revelation that led to the Supreme Court's adoption of its first code of ethics last fall, which prohibits justices from making political statements on issues that may come before them.\nRaskin wrote on Wednesday that it would \"be nice\" if Alito and Thomas decided to recuse themselves from Trump's case in light of the controversy, but that \"begging them to do the right thing misses a far more effective course of action.\"\nThe Democratic lawmaker was, before a life in politics, a professor of constitutional law at American University's Washington College of Law. He said that action could instead be taken by prosecutors at the Department of Justice, who are \"involved in different ways in the criminal prosecutions\" of both Trump's criminal indictment and the prosecution of individuals charged with participating in the January 6 attacks.\nAccording to Raskin, the Justice Department \"can petition the other seven justices to require Justices Alito and Thomas to recuse themselves not as a matter of grace but as a matter of law.\"\n\"The Justice Department and Attorney General Merrick Garland can invoke two powerful textual authorities for this motion: the Constitution of the United States, specifically the due process clause, and the federal statute mandating judicial disqualification for questionable impartiality,\" Raskin wrote.\nThe Due Process Clause, found in both the Fifth and 14th Amendments of the Constitution, states that no one shall be deprived of \"deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law.\" The 14th Amendment specifically lays out that all criminal procedures must be overseen by an unbiased judge, which Raskin writes also applies to the Supreme Court.\nThe federal statute referred to by Raskin, 28 U.S.C. Section 455, states that \"any justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\" Raskin said that the statue, \"if triggered, is not a friendly suggestion. It is Congress's command, binding on the justices, just as the due process clause is.\"\n\"The Supreme Court cannot disregard this law just because it directly affects one or two of its justices,\" the lawmaker added. \"Ignoring it would trespass on the constitutional separation of powers because the justices would essentially be saying that they have the power to override a congressional command.\"\nNewsweek reached out to the Supreme Court press information office via email Wednesday evening for comment on Raskin's op-ed.\nLegal experts have previously cast doubt that the controversy surrounding Alito is enough for the justice to recuse himself from Trump's immunity case. Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told Newsweek last week that while reports regarding the contentious flags outside Alito's home were \"another black eye for the Supreme Court,\" \"practically speaking there is nothing that can be done.\"\nAlito responded to calls to recuse himself in a letter to Democratic Senators on Wednesday, saying that a \"reasonable person who is not motivated by political or ideological considerations\" would not view reports regarding the flags spotted outside of his homes as something that \"meet the applicable standard for recusal.\"\n\"As I have stated publicly, I had nothing whatsoever to do with the flying of that flag. I was not even aware of the upside-down flag until it was called to my attention,\" Alito wrote in the letter, which was addressed to Senators Dick Durbin and Sheldon Whitehouse. The Senators had sent a letter to Chief Justice John Roberts last week requesting that he remove Alito from Trump's case and any others involving January 6.\nFormer President Donald Trump praised Alito's response in a post to Truth Social on Wednesday, writing that it shows \"intelligence, courage and 'guts' to refuse stepping aside from making a decision on anything January 6th related.\"\nOther conservatives have also come to Alito's defense since reports regarding the flags surfaced. After the New York Times reported of an inverted American flag outside Alito's home in Virginia, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters earlier this month that it \"seems to me they're just nonstop attacks on the Supreme Court.\"\nFormer U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton also adamantly defended Alito following reports of an \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag that was found outside the justice's vacation home in New Jersey, telling CNN's Wolf Blitzer last week, that the flag was \"controversial for liberals who have it in for Samuel Alito.\"\n\"Look, it's an American patriotic flag,\" Bolton added. \"I support the right of anybody to fly it. Period.\"\n",

    "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\nScientists have accomplished a whale of a feat. They’ve identified previously unknown complexity in whale communication by analyzing thousands of recorded sequences of sperm whale clicks with artificial intelligence.\nVariations in tempo, rhythm and length of the whales’ click sequences, called codas, weave a rich acoustic tapestry. These variables hint that whales can combine click patterns in multiple ways, mixing and matching phrases to convey a broad range of information to one another.\nWhat sperm whales are saying with their clicks remains a mystery to human ears. Still, uncovering the scope of whales’ vocal exchanges is an important step toward linking whale calls to specific messages or social behaviors, the scientists reported May 7 in the journal Nature Communications.\n“This work builds on a lot of prior work focused on understanding the calls of sperm whales. However, this is the first work that has started to look at sperm whale calls in their wider communicative context and in the context of exchanges between whales, which has made some of the findings possible,” said study coauthor Dr. Daniela Rus, director of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT, in an email.\n“Understanding what aspects of their codas they can control and vary helps us understand how they can encode information in their calls,” Rus said.\nRelated article\nGreat apes tease each other just like humans do, says new study\nThe researchers dubbed their catalog of sound combinations a “phonetic alphabet” for sperm whales, comparing variations in the whales’ click sequences to the production of different phonetic sounds in human speech.\nBut while the team’s findings are interesting, that term offers a misleading perspective on whales’ vocal interactions, said Dr. Luke Rendell, a researcher at the University of St. Andrews in the United Kingdom whose work focuses on communication in marine mammals, in an email.\n“The presentation of the ‘phonetic alphabet’ — it’s nothing of the sort,” said Rendell, who was not involved in the research.\n“The way the tempo variation is used is completely different to how, say, we use elements of an alphabet to construct linguistic expression,” he said. “There’s no evidence of that, and it’s not a super helpful interpretation because it forces everything into a restricted and somewhat over-sold perspective of ‘is it like human language or not,’ when there are a much broader range of interpretations available.”\nSperm whales produce their clicks by forcing air through an organ in their heads called the spermaceti, and these sounds can be as loud as 230 decibels — louder than a rocket launch and capable of rupturing human eardrums — another team of scientists previously reported in the journal Scientific Reports.\nFor the new study, the researchers used machine learning to detect patterns in audio data collected by The Dominica Sperm Whale Project, a repository for observations of sperm whales that inhabit the Caribbean Sea. The recordings represented the voices of approximately 60 sperm whales — a subset of a group of about 400 whales known as the Eastern Caribbean clan — and the vocalizations were recorded between 2005 and 2018.\nPrior research had identified 150 types of codas in sperm whales worldwide, but the Caribbean whales used just 21 of those codas.\nThe scientists examined the timing and frequency of 8,719 coda sequences — in solitary whale utterances, in choruses and in call-and-response exchanges between whales. When visualized with artificial intelligence, previously unseen coda patterns emerged.\nRelated article\nThese snakes not only fake their own deaths, they use gory special effects to do it\nThe study authors defined four features in codas: rhythm, tempo, rubato and ornamentation. Rhythm describes the sequence of intervals between clicks. Tempo is the duration of the entire coda. Rubato refers to variations in duration across adjacent codas of the same rhythm and tempo. And ornamentation is an “extra click” added at the end of a coda in a group of shorter codas, Rus explained.\nThese so-called ornament clicks “occur more towards the beginning and end of turns” during vocal exchanges between whales, “behaving like discourse markers,” Rus said.\nThe discovery that whales could synchronize variations in coda tempo was “a really interesting observation,” Rendell said.\n“I am less convinced by the ‘ornamentation,’” he added. “It occurs very rarely, and I think we need more evidence that they aren’t just production glitches,” or filler sounds, “like when we say ‘um’ or ‘err.’”\nIn all, the program detected 18 types of rhythm, five types of tempo, three types of rubato and two types of ornamentation. These coda features could all be mixed and matched to form an “enormous repertoire” of phrases, the study authors reported. What’s more, meaning could be tweaked even further depending on the placement of a coda — following or overlapping other codas — within an exchange or chorus involving two or more whales.\n“Actually, many of us have been waiting for advanced technology to allow us to do something like this for decades!” said Dr. Brenda McCowan, a professor at the University of California Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, in an email.\nMcCowan, who was not involved in the research, was part of another team that, in 2021, conducted an interactive “conversation” with a humpback whale in waters near Alaska. For about 20 minutes, a curious whale repeatedly responded to a recording of a humpback song transmitted from the scientists’ boat.\n“This particular playback (with the humpback in 2021) was an opportunistic experiment with an inquisitive whale engaging us both behaviorally and vocally, and completely at her own volition,” McCowan said.\nRelated article\nA lone orca killed a great white in less than two minutes. Scientists say it could signal an ecological shift\nSuch interactive experimentation with whales, along with observations of whale behavior, could be an important part of unraveling the syntax of sperm whale click sequences, the authors wrote in the study.\nTheir machine learning method may also prove useful for studying other types of animal vocalizations, McCowan added.\n“Tempo, rhythm, rubato and ornamentation are likely to be found in other species of whales,” McCowan said. “We already know this is true of humpback song. But there is also evidence for this type of patterning in other aquatic, terrestrial and arboreal species to which this approach could be applied.”\nBut although this technique is helpful for identifying certain aspects of communication, it’s no Rosetta stone, Rendell cautioned.\n“Machine learning is great for finding patterns in large datasets,” he said, “but it doesn’t create meaning.”\nMindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine.\n",

    "content": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex embarked on what was officially dubbed a 3-day private visit to Nigeria, yet it unfolded with all the grandeur and attention typically reserved for royal tours.\nTheir first day saw them receive a red-carpet welcome complete with cultural dancers following their arrival in the Nigerian capital of Abuja, where they kicked off a multi-day mental health summit at Lightway Academy.\nThere, they also unveiled a partnership between their Archewell Foundation and the GEANCO Foundation to provide students with school supplies and menstrual products.\nThe pair had been invited to the West African nation by the country’s highest-ranking military official, Christopher Musa. After meeting him at the Nigerian Defence Headquarters, Meghan signed a guest book thanking officials for “welcoming me home.”\nDespite the private nature of their visit, the couple’s itinerary resembled previous official tours they carried out before stepping back as senior working royals in 2020.\nThey were warmly received everywhere they went, with Nigerians showcasing their famed hospitality. The couple were showered with gifts, including a touching portrait of a young Harry with his mum.\nFor both Nigeria and the Sussexes, this visit held significant weight.\nIt was an opportunity for Nigeria to demonstrate its capability to host such high-profile guests and dispel any doubts raised by skeptics, especially considering the country’s standing in the eyes of the UK’s Foreign Office as one of the most dangerous countries to visit in the world.\nNigeria has security issues with a terrorist insurgency in the northeast and northwest. However, it is a huge country —  larger than the US state of Texas  — and the other areas visited by the royal couple over the past several days are relatively safe.\nRelated article\n‘We love you’: Harry plays volleyball with army veterans as he and Meghan get warm welcome in Nigeria\nMeanwhile, for Prince Harry and Meghan, this marked their first major trip to Africa since relinquishing their official royal duties.\nIt was a chance for them to engage in a hearts-and-minds charm offensive, which they executed with aplomb.\nMeghan, in particular, embraced exploring her Nigerian ancestry after discovering several years ago that she is 43% Nigerian through a genealogy test.\nOn Saturday, she co-hosted a women’s leadership event with Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director-General of the World Trade Organisation, for about 50 leading women from across Nigerian society and politics, business, media, and culture.\nDuring a panel discussion, moderated by Nigerian media mogul Mo Abudu, the duchess spoke passionately about uncovering her Nigerian roots and its significance to her own identity.\nShe described Nigeria as “my country,” adding that “being African American, part of it is not knowing so much about your lineage or background, where you come from specifically. And it was exciting … to discover more and understand what that really means.”\nIt was here that Meghan’s natural ability to connect really shone through. She chatted effortlessly with attendees, posed for selfies and engaged in heartfelt conversations.\nAt another event on Sunday at the prestigious Delborough Hotel in Lagos - where the great and good of Nigerian society had gathered to welcome the coupl -  she appeared visibly moved when three powerful traditional rulers honored her with royal titles.\nThe Obi of Onitsha, His Majesty Igwe Nnaemeka Alfred Ugochukwu Achebe christened Meghan “Ada Mazi,” which means “the daughter of the Igbo ancestral palace.”\nWhile, the Oluwo of Iwoland, southwest, Nigeria, Oba Abdulrasheed Adewale Akanbi christened her with the Yoruba name of “Adetokunbo” which means “royalty from across the seas.”\nTheir engagements during the three-day visit were centered around their core passions: sports rehabilitation, mental health, and women’s empowerment.\nFor Harry’s part, the duke demonstrated his compassion and connection to his late mother, Princess Diana, as he visited wounded soldiers at a military hospital in Kaduna, 150 miles from Abuja.\nHis first stop was to drop in on the governor of Kaduna state, Senator Uba Sani, where he was again welcomed by a troupe of dancers and a red carpet. Governor Sani sat opposite him and praised Harry as a “symbol of courage and “praised his service to his country.”\nHe added, “Please give our regards to the Duchess of Sussex, Princess Meghan.”\nHarry toured about six wards and met young men recuperating from their injuries. Many had been shot, ambushed by Boko Haram or lost limbs due to blasts. One moment captured by a photographer showing Harry holding a wounded soldier lying on the hospital bed during the visit resonated deeply and went viral on social media.\nCorporal Yusef, 23, who had been shot through the knee, spoke with the duke, who asked him about his rehab. “Are you going to try for the Invictus Games team? Are you preparing for that?… We will see you there,” Harry suggested.\nTheir visit also extended to cultural experiences, such as witnessing a vibrant dance performance and a polo match at the historic Lagos Polo Club.\nPolo holds special significance for Harry and the event provided a platform to showcase his longstanding commitment to the sport and its charitable endeavors.\nAmid the festivities, the couple expressed gratitude for Nigeria’s warm reception. As they bid farewell to Nigeria, Meghan declared: “I can’t wait to come back!”\n",

    "content": "In what began as a modest effort to support fraternity brothers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who intervened during a pro-Palestinian campus protest to protect an American flag that had been replaced by demonstrators, a tongue-in-cheek GoFundMe campaign has exploded into a major fundraising success.\nThe fundraiser, which started with the goal of throwing \"a world-class party\" for the \"boat-shoed Broletariat\" brothers of Pi Kappa Phi has significantly expanded its scope, garnering more than half-a-million dollars from over 12,000 donors. The response has been so staggering that organizers have decided to end the fundraiser as of Friday.\n\"We've been overwhelmed by the sheer force of patriotism on display,\" John Noonan, the organizer, said in a statement sent to Newsweek. \"What started as a simple gesture to reward a courageous act has captured the attention of millions, representing a wide spectrum of the American public.\"\nBy Friday morning, the GoFundMe had raised more than $516,000 from over 14,800 donors. Three donors — identified on the site as John Clark, Adam Sinn, and William Ackman, the outspoken billionaire investor — gave $10,000 each. A Republican congressman from Georgia, Mike Collins, donated $125. Susan Ralston, a former advisor to George W. Bush, also made a contribution and is listed an organizer.\nDespite the overwhelming public response, the fundraiser has stirred some controversy online, particularly concerning its management and transparency. The Pi Kappa Phi chapter at UNC clarified that they were unaware of Noonan's actions and had not authorized the campaign.\n\"We do not know John Noonan and we have been attempting to contact him,\" the fraternity wrote in an email to the local radio station WUNC on Thursday.\nA national Pi Kappa Phi spokeswoman told Newsweek that they did not set up the fundraiser and are not endorsing it.\nAccording to Noonan, who is a former aide to Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton, plans now include not only the promised \"rager\" but also charitable donations. An independent entity, featuring a board of directors along with representation from the fraternity, is being formed to ensure that the funds are used according to donor intent.\nBefore the campaign concluded, Noonan laid out the dual plans of the donations: \"There is nearly half a million in the bank. That is plenty to throw a killer party and give to some great charities.\"\nThe rapid influx of funds and support prompted the organizers to scale up their original plans. Volunteers have been drafted to manage the offers to contribute merchandise, entertainment, and more, Noonan said. A seasoned professional planner has also been retained to handle the complex logistics for the party.\n\"With graduation just around the corner, final exams in full swing, and continued drama on campus, we think it is best to take our time and plan this right,\" Noonan wrote on GoFundMe.\nThe viral incident that kicked off the fundraiser happened when pro-Palestinian demonstrators had replaced the U.S. flag on the campus' main quad with a Palestinian flag. Members of the UNC Chapel Hill chapter of the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity intervened to prevent the American flag from touching the ground, coming under both verbal and physical attacks as they held it up, according to video that circulated widely on social media.\nLike many other elite universities across the U.S., the bucolic Chapel Hill campus has been embroiled in protests between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli groups, who hold differing views on Israel's offensive in Gaza. More than 2,000 people across the country have been arrested since the protests began.\nThe protest movement originated at Columbia University, where students established an encampment demanding the university divest from companies linked to Israel over that country's ongoing war in Gaza, which followed a deadly attack by Hamas on southern Israel on October 7 in which militants killed 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage.\nIn retaliation, Israel's subsequent bombardment of Gaza has caused more than 34,000 deaths, according to the latest report by the Associated Press citing the local Hamas-run health ministry.\nUpdate 5/3/24 1:30 p.m. ET: This story has been corrected to note that Tom Cotton is a senator from Arkansas, not Texas. We regret the error.\n",

    "content": "Vladimir Putin, Muammar Gaddafi, Mark Zuckerberg. Presidents and Hollywood stars; political dissidents, abuse survivors and immigrants. One thing unites them all: a slightly scuffed, white wooden box.\n“More world leaders have sat on that box than any chair in history,” the photographer Platon, owner of that very box, told CNN in an interview conducted over Zoom. For some world leaders, the scarcity of his set — sitting on the box in front of a plain black or white sheet of paper — can be intimidating, stripping them of their usual grandeur. For others it’s liberating, allowing the human to shine through the professional storyteller. For the subjects of Platon’s new book “The Defenders,” the box became an opportunity.\n“There’s a statement that’s quite common in the human rights community,” Platon said. “‘Giving a voice to the voiceless’. I have learned through my experiences that it’s not right to say that. They have beautiful, powerful, strong voices; the issue is that those voices have been ignored.” Through his work, he explained his mission is to help amplify people’s stories, tuning into their humanity as though they were “an old-fashioned radio”.\nBorn in Greece in 1968, Platon Antoniou moved to the UK aged eight and completed his studies in photography at the Royal College of Art, before leaving London for a career in New York. There, he worked on George magazine with John Kennedy Jr. and as a staff photographer at the New Yorker magazine.\n“The Defenders” takes a different tack to Platon’s earlier work. As a young photographer, he confessed he was dazzled by the world of politicians and celebrities he was working with, walking the corridors of the Kremlin and Downing Street and “having a chat about life” in George Clooney’s garden. Turning his lens to the powerless, by contrast, has upturned his ideas of power altogether.\nRelated article\nThe photographer who changed the way the world saw New York\n“Having photographed all these world leaders, often the people I meet in the trenches of the human rights movement are proper leaders,” he said. “They transform their adversity into compassion for others. And that’s something I very rarely see on that level in the political sphere. So I called them — I call the book — “The Defenders,” because it’s a superhero title. These are ordinary people who do extraordinary things, and I do think of them as superheroes. Changing the narrative is very important for me.”\nAmong “The Defenders” are Burmese and Egyptian dissidents, the imprisoned Russian punk band Pussy Riot, and survivors of sexual violence at Dr. Denis Mukwege’s Panzi Hospital in Congo. One of the girls that Platon photographed there was Esther Faraja. She appeared in an episode of Netflix’s “Abstract: The Art of Design,” profiling Platon, although he said the details of the trauma she suffered were “too harsh to put in the film.”\n“As I was taking the picture, she wasn’t crying,” he recalled. “I’m a privileged, middle-aged white man, and I’m a mess. I said to her, ‘how is it that I’m crying, and you’re not crying? And yet, you’re the one that has suffered?’ And she said: ‘the reason I don’t cry in your picture is because I don’t want to make you feel sad. I don’t want anyone to feel sad when they look at a picture of me. My mommy and daddy brought me into this world to bring joy to the world. And I will keep my promise’.” Platon is as awestruck now as he was standing in front of her. “Now that is a leader,” he said. “I made a promise to her that I will deliver her message of compassion and strength, combined, to as many people as I can.”\n“The Defenders” is an attempt to tell dozens of stories like hers, each captured in one 500th of a second. “Time is a very interesting concept; it doesn’t really ever exist,” Platon mused. “You try to freeze a moment that helps us understand the past and will still be relevant in the future. And yet, it was a moment in the present. And it was such a tiny fragment of a moment that if you blinked, you wouldn’t even have seen it.”\nTwo political giants offer obvious examples of time’s bizarre effect. Vladimir Putin, photographed by Platon for Time’s Person of the Year in 2007, initially liked the image that Platon produced. He appears powerful. In the time since its publication, however, the same image has been taken, edited, and circulated by political dissidents to mock Putin and belittle his power.\nRelated article\nWhy this morning-after portrait of Faye Dunaway became an iconic Hollywood moment\n“I heard in the last two years that anyone who’s caught circulating my picture in connection with human rights issues will go to jail,” Platon said. “Now, it’s the same picture. And Putin likes it.”\nBill Clinton, on a December 2000 cover of Esquire courtesy of Platon, has also been changed with age. “At the time, that picture represented insane levels of charisma,” Platon recalled. “He was great with people — everyone says there’s no one more charismatic than Bill Clinton. We look at it through a different lens now, but it’s the same picture. When I get it right, that same picture works for everybody.”\nIt doesn’t work for Hillary Clinton, though. “Hillary refuses to sit for me,” Platon noted. “She’s one of the only politicians who’s ever said no. And that’s interesting. The ‘no’ now is actually as interesting as the ‘yes’.”\nDistilling broad, complicated, emotional human stories into one fleeting moment is a tribulation of all photography, including that of world leaders, but it was particularly difficult when it came to the sensitive topics broached in “The Defenders”. “Many of (the people photographed) risk their lives and their security telling me these stories,” Platon said. “I cannot be reckless. I cannot be — I must not be — a thrill-seeker.”\nExerting due diligence and handling sensitive subjects thoughtfully is something that Platon admits is a luxury of time; he is able to spend months on a project, producing the most considered and provoking images he can. Increasingly, however, a lot of the photography flooding social media is taken hastily, captured on phones and shared without so much as a pause for breath. In “The Defenders,” Platon remembers the Burmese politician Aung San Suu Kyi coming out of house arrest and being bewildered by the sea of smartphones pointed at her.\n“Now everyone’s a photographer, and everyone’s a filmmaker,” Platon observed. “In many ways, that’s fantastic. People are holding the powers that be accountable in a new way. The danger is that there’s so much information that we’re constantly distracted. It’s very difficult to get that moment of reflection and pause, and to stand back and think for yourself. As you’re even doing that, your phone is dinging and clicking and beeping — it’s constant noise.”\nIn standing back, Platon was able to join the dots between the movements he was documenting; they weren’t isolated struggles, he realized, but connected ones. “Obviously each geopolitical situation is inherently different, but they are all fighting for very basic human principles,” he said. “I photographed LGBTQ+ defenders in Burma and in Russia. That’s two very, very different countries, with the same cause.”\nIn capturing and amplifying the stories of “The Defenders,” Platon hopes to inspire and instruct other people, just as he was inspired and instructed.\n“It’s really a handbook to the new generation to say: roll up your sleeves, get involved. Society needs a new generation of activists who will think differently. They will have a different path to navigate, but the principles remain timeless and the same. It’s the principles that unite us all. The way we fight, the tools we fight with, the strategies — we have to change those, because times change. But the principles stay the same.”\n“The Defenders”, published by MW Editions, is available now.\n",

Russian media had reported earlier this month that Ukraine had withdrawn from the village, and geolocated footage from Friday showed Kyiv's troops pulling back from the north of the village, the ISW said.\n",

In the interim, Prince William has been asked about his wife's condition during public appearances. In May, he told well-wishers she was \"doing well.\"\nNow, as the monarchy heads into one of its busiest periods of the year without one of its star members, a British news show has heard that the institution needs to come up with a plan to keep public demand for information at bay if this continues into the fall.\nSky News anchor Kay Burley told Newsweek's Jack Royston that an information \"vacuum\" about Kate's health had started to rebuild, after a similar instance in February prior to the cancer announcement led to the spread of conspiracy theories and tabloid gossip.\n\"It's starting to emerge again but only at a low level, significantly lower than we were seeing in kind of late February and through March,\" Royston said, noting the need for preemptive action.\n\"I think they've got time. I think that they will survive until the autumn...the royals obviously go to Balmoral for the summer in August and they're going to have to come back from the August break with a plan for how to manage public opinion and how to manage the questions from the media as well.\"\nThe challenge, he explained, is that interest in Kate and her health extends beyond Britain. Polling for Newsweek conducted in May revealed that the princess is America's favorite royal, closely followed by Prince William.\n\"You have to remember that there's a big market in America and [this] can generate a huge audience on social media too so it's not enough just to have Britain under control,\" Royston noted.\nNewsweek approached Kensington Palace via email for comment.\nIn Britain, the news cycle is dominated by the upcoming general election, which will take place on July 4, taking some pressure off Kate, but her likely absence from showpiece royal events in the coming weeks could refocus attention on her health due to a public desire for updates.\nOn June 15, the annual Trooping the Colour military parade and Buckingham Palace balcony appearance—usually a showcase for Kate's celebrated style—by the senior royals are set to go ahead.\nJune 17 will be Garter Day at Windsor Castle which Kate, as wife to Prince William who is a Knight of the Order of the Garter, has traditionally attended.\nIn addition to this, the State Opening of Parliament is to take place on July 17. Kate could have been expected to attend in her role as Princess of Wales.\nMajor sports events like the Royal Ascot horse racing festival and Wimbledon Tennis Championships would also traditionally see Kate in attendance.\nIf Kate chooses to attend any event, it is not expected that it will be announced far in advance. Nor would it be expected to signify a complete return to public duties.\nAt the time of her cancer announcement, Kate said she was looking forward to returning to her work, but that for the time being she needed to focus on her health.\n\"We hope that you will understand that, as a family, we now need some time, space and privacy while I complete my treatment,\" she said.\n\"My work has always brought me a deep sense of joy and I look forward to being back when I am able, but for now I must focus on making a full recovery.\"\nJames Crawford-Smith is Newsweek's royal reporter based in London.

The payments started going out in April and will continue until June 2025.\n\"To restore truth to the idea of the American dream for working families, we must give people what they need to be successful,\" Woodards said in a statement. \"If we are going to effectively eradicate inequity in Tacoma or in any city across America, then we must look at all of the conditions that impact our residents.

    "content": "NASCAR's oldest active full-time driver on the Cup circuit is calling it quits.\nMartin Truex Jr., 43, will announce his retirement at a press conference Friday at Iowa Speedway according to multiple reports. Truex has been a full-time Cup driver since 2006 and won his only championship with Furniture Row Racing in 2017.\nThe Athletic, which was first to report the news Thursday, reports that Truex \"seriously mulled retirement for the past few years\" before reaching his decision. The Joe Gibbs Racing driver had been racing on a series of one-year contracts in recent years, leaving his future up in the air as a new generation emerged.\nAccording to Fox Sports' Bob Pockrass, \"JGR wanted an answer now as there are several drivers without contracts for 2025, and JGR didn't want to lose a chance to land a driver while waiting on a Truex decision.\"\nTruex came on the scene as the son of an unheralded professional racer from New Jersey who made 15 starts in the former Busch Series (now the Xfinity Series) from 1989-98.\nThe younger Truex earned two straight Busch Series championships in 2004-05, earning a full-time promotion to NASCAR's highest circuit in 2006. He took over the No. 1 car on a full-time basis for Dale Earnhardt, Inc. and garnered two top-five finishes on the year.\nTruex won the annual Cup race in Dover, Delaware in 2007 en route to 34 victories on the circuit — and counting. He enters Sunday's inaugural Iowa Corn 350 ranked No. 5, with a chance at contending for his second career championship.\nAfter the 2009 season, Truex left Earnhardt Ganassi Racing (the NASCAR successor to DEI) to drive the No. 56 Toyota Camry for Michael Waltrip. He moved to Furniture Row Racing in 2014 and would record a top-four finish with them in 2015.\nThe 2017 season was Truex's most dominant, and ended with a championship-clinching race at Miami. It was the peak of a career that will likely result in NASCAR Hall of Fame enshrinement once Truex is eligible two years after his retirement.\nTruex made his fourth Championship Four appearance in his first season with Gibbs' team in 2019. The following year saw him miss the Championship Four for the first time since 2016 and finish seventh, but he rebounded with a runner-up finish to Kyle Larson in 2021.\nTruex missed the playoffs again in 2022 but rebounded in 2023 to finish fifth in the final points standings.\nAccording to Pockrass, Stewart-Haas Racing driver Chase Briscoe is the top candidate to replace Truex in the No. 19 JGR Toyota Camry.\n",

    "content": "The FDA recently issued an update regarding a previous recall of Fiji Natural Artesian Water bottles over concerns they were contaminated with manganese. But what is manganese, and why is it a health risk?\nManganese is a common, naturally occurring mineral found in rocks, soil, and natural water sources. It is also an essential nutrient—found in a range of foods, including nuts, seeds and green, leafy vegetables—that supports a range of important bodily functions, such as bone health, reproductive health, immunity and wound healing.\nHowever, it is possible to have too much of a good thing. Chronic, excessive exposure to the element can result in a neurological condition called manganism. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, manganism symptoms are similar to those of Parkinson's disease and include trembling, stiffness, slow movement and depression. Additional symptoms, as listed by the National Institutes of Health, can include mania, insomnia, delusion, hearing loss and memory problems.\nThe U.K. government's Health Protection Agency said high manganese exposure could also affect brain development in children.\nIn March, the FDA announced a recall of over 70,000 cases of Fiji Natural Artesian Water bottles over concerns they were contaminated with manganese and three types of bacteria. The FDA has since lowered the classification of the water bottle recall to one that is \"not likely to cause adverse health consequences.\"\nWelders and people who work in steel factories are the most at risk of developing manganism because of the high levels of exposure in their working environment. However, manganese exposure can also occur through drinking water because of the natural mineral deposits in groundwater.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency has determined that in drinking water, manganese concentrations below 1 milligram per liter for up to 10 days are unlikely to cause any adverse health effects, even in children, the CDC reports. However, the FDA says manganese concentrations in bottled drinking water should not exceed 0.05 milligrams per liter.\nNewsweek has contacted the FDA via email and Fiji via its website for comment.\nIn a post on X, formerly Twitter, Fiji responded to questions regarding the March recall, writing: \"We learned of a quality issue affecting select FIJI Water 500mL (24-Pack) cases with PRD dates of Nov. 11, 2023, Nov. 12, 2023, Nov. 13, 2023, Nov. 24, 2023, and Nov. 25, 2023 sold through Amazon.com.\"\nThe brand added in a separate post: \"The notice sent by Amazon does not accurately reflect the issue. We were notified of a quality issue with complaints of discoloration in select product with PRD dates of Nov. 11, 12, 13, 2023, and Nov. 24, 25, 2023.\"\n\"FIJI Water remains safe to buy and consume,\" the brand said. \"This is a quality issue only affecting the specific lots sold on Amazon.com between February 1, 2024 and March 3, 2024 with PRD dates of Nov. 11, 2023, Nov. 12, 2023, Nov. 13, 2023, Nov. 24, 2023, and Nov. 25, 2023.\"\nIs there a health problem that's worrying you?

    "content": "Even when you know it's coming, even when you know a successful appeal is likely, even when there is fair analysis that a conviction may be a net positive for former President Donald Trump's chances in November, Thursday's guilty verdict in a Manhattan courtroom on 34 counts is still a sad new low for an American justice system that is supposedly based on facts, evidence, judges who preside fairly, and juries that decide coherently.\nThose standards lie in ruins at the feet of the metaphoric image of Lady Justice, the famous figure seated holding a scale and wearing a blindfold. The scale represents the necessity of weighing evidence objectively. That did not happen in Trump's case. The blindfold represents a system that treats citizens without regard for who appears before it. That means no benefit for the rich or powerful, no disadvantage for any marginalized class.\nTrump represented a singular combination of a wealthy, powerful defendant who nonetheless represented an aggrieved figure in the forum of a New York courtroom. It was not a glib take to say he could not get a fair trial on the island of Manhattan. Every dark suspicion held by skeptics has been confirmed. The fix was in.\nI will leave to others the task of detailing the procedural outrages that should lead to a successful appeal. The bones of that challenge will involve a biased judge lording over a trial on artificially concocted crimes, featuring testimony from some witnesses who trafficked in irrelevancies and other testimony disallowed because it would have brought helpful clarity.\nA different type of clarity now settles over a troubled America. Our institutions are collapsing before our eyes. Our courts used to be venerable halls of reliable justice. Real crimes used to be prosecuted. District attorneys used to avoid targeting people in political vendettas.\nIt is of only middling comfort that the appeal may someday fix this. This should never have happened. And I don't mean the conviction; I mean the trial itself. The sparsity of the charges aside, consider for a moment that a former president of the United States was dragged into a dank New York court building because his enemies sought to ruin him for how an expenditure was characterized in a legal matter.\nIn a larger sense, the true motivation is far more ominous. Trump is being punished for the crime of beating Hillary Clinton and the anticipation of repeat offender status when he beats Joe Biden.\nThe system whose corruptions Trump has long identified seeks to cripple him because its denizens know his return to the White House is a direct threat to its power and influence. That system is looking to destroy him politically, financially and personally.\nHe has known this from the outset. He emerged from court Thursday defiant: \"This was a rigged and disgraceful trial,\" he proclaimed into the cameras and microphones in the courthouse lobby that have marked his arrivals and departures for six weeks. \"The real verdict will come November fifth.\"\n\"I am fighting for our country and our Constitution,\" he continued. \"We will fight to the end and we will win. Our country is going to hell.\"\nHow deeply does that sentiment resonate now among the jurors who matter most—the voters? A felony conviction is normally never a candidate's favorite development, but nothing about this is normal. Americans who despise Trump are not more numerous as a result of his verdict; they are simply happier. The voting bloc that may grow could be defined as those who have been wobbly on him up to now but who are repelled by the sight of his persecution at the hands of a system weaponized to block his return to the White House.\nThis is election interference on steroids, and it's not only MAGA Nation that will seek to respond.\nThat response will come in November. If it were today, Trump would win in a landslide. For every timid soul suddenly concluding that Biden isn't so bad because of what twelve jurors say about Trump, there may be several more declaring that this cannot stand. His campaign should be scouting NASCAR tracks for his next rally, because conventional arenas will not suffice.\nThe question is whether those passions can sustain for four months. The path to November features stops on a debate stage June 27 and a Republican convention three weeks later. Plopped between those dates is the expected sentencing July 11. Each of those moments provides an opportunity for Trump to remind the nation of what has been done to him.\nSome Americans seeking to protest this spectacle have just become Trump voters. Their power, combined with the millions who have been with him for years, may yet overturn this verdict with a force and finality that would dwarf any appeals court.\nA Trump victory will repair this injustice, but it will not erase it. No one should forget that it happened. Tinhorn political hacks in DA offices all over America are already energized in search of the big fish of their dreams. While the court of public opinion will rule on Trump's fate on November 5, a broader public outcry will be needed to prevent this from ever happening again—to anyone.\nMark Davis is a syndicated talk show host for the Salem Media Group on 660AM The Answer in Dallas-Ft.

    "content": "The changing language used by the Ukrainian military in 72 hours of daily updates tells the story: “Ongoing defensive fighting.” “Significantly worsened.” Russian “tactical success.”\nYou rarely ever hear Kyiv’s top brass sounding downbeat, but their steep southerly trajectory reflects the grave place Ukraine finds itself in. Russia is not just advancing slowly in one place; it appears to be advancing in four, across the frontline.\nMoscow knows it is on the clock: in about a month, the $61billion of US military aid will start to translate into Ukraine having the weapons it has been begging for. So, Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to be throwing whatever he can at it, knowing the fight will likely only get tougher for his forces in the summer ahead.\nFirst, and most acutely troubling, is the northern border near Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city. Russian forces have crossed the border in multiple locations and claim to have seized nine villages. Their move 3 to 4.5 miles (5 to 7 kilometers) into Ukraine, in the border area above Ukraine’s second city of Kharkiv, is arguably their fastest advance since the first days of the war. Russia has thrown five battalions at the border town of Vovchansk, Ukrainian officials said, which has been hit hard by airstrikes over the weekend.\nThe town of Lyptsi is at risk, say some military bloggers, and from there Russian forces could hit Kharkiv with artillery. This is a nightmare for Kyiv for two reasons: firstly, they liberated this land from Russian forces 18 months ago, yet failed, clearly, to fortify the area enough to prevent Moscow sweeping back with the ease with which they were swept out.\nAnd secondly, Russia can again tie up Ukraine’s over-stretched army with constant and grinding pressure on Kharkiv, exacting a toll with crude shelling on a vast urban center.\nRelated article\nShifting his fishing buddy sideways in the Kremlin, Putin chooses an economy expert for the war in Ukraine. Here’s why\nThen there is the rest of the front, where progress in Kharkiv region has been mirrored by old, exhausting fights suddenly seeing new Russian success. This should be the greatest cause for concern to Kyiv, as it suggests a coordinated bid to push in all directions and leave Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky with ugly choices about where to send limited resources, and where ultimately to sacrifice.\nMoving slowly south from Kharkiv, closer to Bakhmut, the town of Chasiv Yar has been under intense pressure – a valuable height above two key Ukrainian military towns, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, which could prove an exhaustive pressure point over the summer on Kyiv’s supply lines. Netailove and Krasnohorivka slightly further south show Russian forces making further gains to the west of Avdiivka, and threatening another key hub – Pokrovsk. If Ukraine begins to fall back further here, its grip on the remnants of Donetsk region could be at risk.\nAnd then overnight, Deep State Map, a Ukrainian military analysis group, said the southern village of Verbove was under greater threat – one of the minimal gains from Kyiv’s stymied summer counteroffensive last year. All across the board, the news is bad: it is a growing calamity.\nUkraine’s rhetorical response has been telling. Its leaders have, for once, openly said how bad it is. They appear to be shuffling commanders around – which is not something you do in the heat of battle without desperate reason. There is vocal criticism of the failure to prepare and fortify the northern border regions over the past year. Indeed, along much of the front line where there is not active fighting, and in the near-rear to active frontlines, fortifications seem wanting, if not entirely absent. It may be that Kyiv believed so much in its counteroffensive last summer, that it failed to entertain the idea of bad news this summer.\nKyiv’s larger problem is global attention. Trenchant statements from European ministers, and even visits from senior Biden administration officials, cannot cut through the fatigue or the notion that helping Ukraine win is something governments see they strategically must do, rather than something their publics actively demand. It is becoming a war the world wishes would go away – side-lined by the horrors of the Middle East – exactly when its outcome is most perilous and vital for European security.\nRelated article\nPutin replaces Russia’s defense minister with a civilian as Ukraine war rages and defense spending spirals\nPutin used the weekend to reshuffle some of his cabinet – moving Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to a more procedural role as National Security Council head, and perhaps further away from the wartime cookie jar. An accountant, Andrey Belousov, will take his place. But this is not necessarily a sign of retribution for failure, or a reset: the same old boys still get nice jobs. It smacks more of Moscow economizing, integrating the war more fully into the economy, and settling in for the longer haul.\nThe opposite is happening in the West, where the congressional dysfunction pausing that paused the US’s $61 billion in aid has already wreaked havoc on Ukraine’s military effort. Its forces are losing now because of that six-month delay in ammunition reaching them. Europe talks big about making up the gap, but it cannot. And Washington DC will now be in a whirlwind of electioneering ahead of the US elections in November just when Kyiv needs American certainty most.\nThe news is not just bad, it is worsening daily. The ground on the front lines is drying out, bringing us into the season to attack. Russia has momentum unlike anything seen since March 2022. Ukraine is being forced to admit just how bad the situation is. Much of the world may be tiring of this war, but Putin is not.\n",

    "content": "Following the Miami Sprint race, FIA stewards have proposed a review of penalty systems for repeat offenses. This development followed a series of penalties issued to Haas driver Kevin Magnussen for multiple track excursions while battling with Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton.\nDuring the recent Miami Sprint, an intense on-track battle between Kevin Magnussen and Lewis Hamilton caught the attention of the FIA stewards. Magnussen, who was penalized three times for leaving the track, has now become the focal point in a broader discussion about the adequacy of current penalty regulations concerning repeated infringements.\nKevin Magnussen, in his post-race comments to Sky Sports F1, acknowledged the fairness of the penalties assessed against him. He explained his race tactics, which were primarily designed to assist his teammate, Nico Hulkenberg. He explained:\n\"All the penalties were well deserved - no doubt about it. I was in a very good position behind Nico there. In the beginning of the race, I gained a lot of positions and was up in P8. I was protecting well from Lewis because I had the DRS from Nico and I had good pace.\n\"Then Nico cut the chicane and I lost the DRS. Nico could have given that back to give me the DRS to protect because then we would have easily been P7 and P8. Instead, I was really vulnerable to Lewis. Started fighting with him like crazy and I had to just create the gap like I did in Jeddah.\n\"I started using these stupid tactics which I don't like doing, but at the end of the day I did my job as a team player and Nico scored his points because I got that gap for him so Lewis and Tsunoda couldn't catch him.\n\"Not the way I like to go racing at all, but it was what I had to do today.\"\nThe stewards, upon reviewing the incidents, cleared Magnussen of any unsportsmanlike behavior and recognized his acceptance of the standard penalties. The stewards' report highlighted as quoted by Motorsport Week:\n\"The driver candidly explained that he thought that he was entitled to race with Car 44 in the manner that he did and also that he was willing to accept what he considered to be standard penalties that would have been imposed on him for any infringements that occurred while he was battling for position.\n\"He was also of the view that building a gap between himself and the cars ahead was perfectly within the regulations and it was not uncommon for a driver to seek to assist his team-mate in the course of a race by doing so.\n\"He did not at any point in time think that what he was doing was wrong or that it was in any way unsportsmanlike.\"\nIn light of these events, the stewards have suggested a review of the penalty system for repeat offenses, signaling a potential shift in how future races might be regulated. They noted the necessity of enhancing penalties to deter drivers from repeatedly leaving the track, thereby maintaining the integrity of the sport.\nThe report from the Stewards continued:\n\"Moving forward, the Stewards will need to consider if, in appropriate situations, especially in the case of repeat infringements, the penalties to be applied for each infringement need to be increased to discourage scenarios such as those that we found today.\n\"This is something that we will raise explicitly with the FIA and the Stewarding team.\"\n",

    "content": "A new study by Harvard social science researchers suggests that aliens may have been living on Earth for a while.\nThe research paper—which is yet to be peer-reviewed—suggests that life forms from other worlds could be living underground on Earth or within the moon, and that UFOs and other unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) may in fact be evidence for them getting around.\nThe study suggests an \"unconventional\" explanation for UAP, with the authors of the paper hailing from Harvard University's Human Flourishing Program, which researches the factors that contribute to human well-being and flourishing.\nUAP are any objects or phenomena that cannot be immediately identified or explained by known human-made or natural sources. The authors point out that the \"A\" in UAP represents \"anomalous\" in their study, rather than \"aerial\" as is commonly the case, because some UAP are not only airborne but may travel underwater.\nUAP have been reported in various forms, including spheres, discs, triangles, and other shapes, ranging in size from small orbs to large craft. Many exhibit flight patterns and maneuvers that defy conventional aerodynamics, such as sudden changes in direction, high speeds, and the ability to hover without apparent propulsion systems.\nLast summer, 36-year-old air force veteran David Grusch caused a media storm after he said that a top-secret U.S. military program had found the wreckage of several fully intact unidentified aerial craft, some of which contained dead non-human pilots.\nA 2023 report from the Office for the Director of National Intelligence found that there were 510 UAP sightings in 2022, higher than the 366 seen in 2021. Of these, 171 were considered to \"appear to have demonstrated unusual flight characteristics or performance capabilities, and require further analysis.\"\n\"Hypotheses for such phenomena tend to fall into two classes: a conventional terrestrial explanation (e.g., human-made technology), or an extraterrestrial explanation (i.e., advanced civilizations from elsewhere in the cosmos),\" the Harvard researchers wrote in the new paper.\n\"However, there is also a third minority class of hypothesis: an unconventional terrestrial explanation, outside the prevailing consensus view of the universe,\" they wrote. \"This is the ultraterrestrial hypothesis, which includes as a subset the 'cryptoterrestrial' hypothesis, namely the notion that UAP may reflect activities of intelligent beings concealed in stealth here on Earth (e.g., underground), and/or its near environs (e.g., the moon), and/or even \"walking among us\" (e.g., passing as humans).\"\nIn the paper, the researchers discuss four theories of how aliens may be living alongside us, the first of which—the human cryptoterrestrials theory—suggests that there may be an ancient human civilization much more technologically advanced than our own that has somehow survived in secret.\nThe second theory is that there is a technologically advanced non-human civilization that evolved on Earth in secret, created by an ape-like hominid or some \"unknown, intelligent dinosaurs.\"\nThe third suggests that there are aliens or humans from the future that live on the Earth in secret, and the fourth suggests there are \"magical cryptoterrestrials\" akin to \"earthbound angels,\" which the researchers compare to \"fairies, elves, nymphs.\"\n\"The principal weakness of [the final theory], by contrast, is its utter strangeness, particularly for readers schooled to limit themselves to modes of explanation within the bounds of, say, the standard model of physics,\" the researchers write in the paper. \"While belief in extraterrestrials is tenable, belief in (something like) fairies is simply not a live option for many scientists.\n\"Although this idea is likely to be regarded skeptically by most scientists, such are the nature of some UAP that we argue this possibility should not be summarily dismissed, and instead deserves genuine consideration in a spirit of epistemic humility and openness.\"\nHowever, the majority of experts in the field do not believe that UFOs or UAP are evidence of extraterrestrial activity.\n\"I think these encounters capture the imagination differently for different people,\" Joshua Semeter, a professor of electrical and computer engineering and director of the Center for Space Physics at Boston University, previously told Newsweek. \"As a technologist, my speculation is that some form of advanced technology may be at play. But I remain confident that it is human technology. There are next-generation propulsion systems that could account for the unfamiliar flight characteristics observed.\n\"For me, the leap to speculations about aliens is a leap too far. But it is important to retain an open mind as we solve this mystery.\"\nDo you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering? Do you have a question about UAPs?

    "content": "McDonald’s and other fast food chains are charging more. So much so that you may want to consider going for a slightly slower burger. Or at least, that’s what Applebee’s wants you to think about.\n“You can get our burger for $9.99,” John Peyton, CEO of Applebee’s parent company Dine Brands, told CNN in an interview. With that in mind, “why would you take a $10 burger … that you can eat in a bag out of your car?”\nIf Peyton’s sales pitch resonates with customers, it could help convince diners to eat at sit-down restaurants, something they might otherwise see as an indulgence.\nFor a while, restaurant customers were trading down — swapping out expensive meals for cheaper ones, but still dining out. Now, some are responding to higher menu prices by trading out entirely: Instead of opting for cheaper restaurants or meals, they’re eating more at home and spending less when they do go out.\nThat means that restaurants have to battle it out for these cost-conscious consumers. And now, it’s not just burger chain against burger chain.\nRelated article\nRestaurants are competing for frugal diners’ dollars\nBecause fast food joints have been hiking up prices in recent years, dine-in spots like Applebee’s can run promotions that end up costing about the same as a fast food lunch — giving them a chance to try to steal those customers away.\nThe overlap offers “a new opportunity,” according to Peyton. Lunch at McDonald’s now costs about the same as lunch at Applebee’s, where you can sit at a table and have your meal delivered by a server. Pointing that out is a new way to bid for customers.\nApplebee’s, which has seen sales slump as lower-income customers pull back, is offering deals and hoping the prices will speak for themselves. Chili’s, on the other hand, is making the comparison more explicit.\nFor them, and the fast food chains they’re now competing against, the stakes are high.\nYears of price hikes have contributed to declining traffic, pushing restaurants to fight over fewer customers, according to David Henkes, a senior principal at Technomic, a food industry research and consulting firm.\n“It’s a smaller pie today than it was a year ago,” he said. “You’re competing for a share of a smaller market. And so it is more competitive.”\nFast food prices, in particular, have shot up. “Fast food has gotten really expensive,” Henkes said. “Certainly, relative to where it was 12 to 18 months ago, and also in comparison to casual dining sit-down restaurants right now.”\nIn the 12 months through March, not adjusting for seasonal swings, prices at fast food and fast casual restaurants went up 5%, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In that period full-service menu prices went up 3.2%, and grocery prices ticked up 1.2%.\nA few years ago, McDonald’s said that it could raise prices without losing too many customers. But now, it’s struggling with lower-income customers.\nRelated article\nWhat went wrong at Red Lobster\nCEO Chris Kempczinski said during a February analyst call that “the battle ground is certainly with that low-income consumer.” The following month, CFO Ian Borden conceded during another analyst call that “it’s a challenging consumer environment.”\nThe chain is working on a $5 menu to win over those customers, according to Bloomberg.\nThings aren’t much better over at Applebee’s.\nSales at US Applebee’s locations open at least a year slumped 4.6% in the first quarter. In that period, customers who earn $50,000 a year or less visited less often, and spent less when they did, Peyton said, adding that the demographic makes up about 45% of Applebee’s customers.\n“For several quarters… we’ve been asking ourselves, when will we see the impact of inflation, and the economy in general, and interest rates, on on our guest,” he said. “We really began to see it in the first quarter.”\nHe added that “we think it’s going to be a fight for share of wallet and market share all year.”\nWith fast food prices high, sit-down restaurants can make a case for themselves.\nPeople have taken their fast food price grievances to social channels, some complaining about the price of McDonald’s burgers and hash browns. Chili’s has been paying attention.\n“Our social media team has been watching the conversation that the consumer is frustrated by fast food prices,” said Kevin Hochman, president of Chili’s and CEO of its parent company, Brinker International, during an April analyst call. In response, Chili’s decided to run ads that “use fast food as a foil,” he said.\nThe chain said in an April press release that it was adding a new burger — which it described as having “twice the beef of a Big Mac and flavors fast food lovers will recognize” — to its ‘3 for me’ value menu. For $10.99, customers get the burger plus an app and a drink.\nOn X, Chili’s asked whether Chili’s is better than fast food, and promised rewards to those who said yes. Chili’s also ran video ads comparing its food favorably to fast food burgers.\nBut it might not be that easy. Getting people to go to Chili’s instead of McDonald’s may be a stretch, said Henkes.\nOne problem for chains like Chili’s and Applebee’s is that they’re not so much competing on price, as they are on time.\n“People go to sit-down restaurants, generally speaking, for different occasions, than they go to fast food restaurants,” Henkes noted. You might expect to spend an hour at a Chili’s or an Applebee’s, and breeze right through a McDonald’s.\nStill, campaigns like Chili’s can help communicate to customers that these days its food is relatively cheap.\n“Planting that seed that, ‘Hey, we’re a good value,’ I think is a good message to have,” Henkes said.\n",

    "content": "The clock has begun ticking for TikTok to find a new owner.\nPresident Joe Biden signed legislation Wednesday that would ban TikTok in the United States unless its Chinese parent, ByteDance, sells the app. TikTok plans to challenge the law in court, but if it fails, the company would have to find a buyer, and fast.\nThat raises the question of who the US government might view as a suitable new owner of a social media platform with 170 million US users and a rising challenger to legacy social media giants such as Facebook-parent Meta.\nThe prospect of a TikTok sale could lead to a potential feeding frenzy, drawing out everyone from tech companies to retailers and private equity firms and investment bankers.\nAnd an added headache for any potential buyer: China’s commerce ministry has previously said it would “firmly oppose” any forced sale of TikTok.\nThere’s no apparent consensus on a favorite bidder yet. But some candidates seem more likely than others, legal experts and business analysts say.\nAny effort by an established tech giant with a large social media presence would immediately trigger antitrust red flags, according to analysts.\nMeta is already fighting a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit that alleges its purchase of WhatsApp and Instagram violated US antitrust law, and the FTC is actively seeking to break up the company.\nRelated article\nBanning TikTok would hit China’s tech ambitions and deepen the global digital divide\nGoogle is also fighting Justice Department antitrust suits on two fronts. These are related to its search and advertising technology businesses, not its ownership of YouTube. Still, the company is under such close scrutiny that it would be a poor candidate to buy TikTok, experts say.\n“If it’s Amazon, Microsoft, Google or Meta, I just think you’re going to see substantial antitrust concern,” said Gene Kimmelman, a former Justice Department antitrust official. “If you were to say, like, an Intel, or a Cisco, maybe Oracle, I don’t know. If you were to tell me it’s Verizon, or AT&T, maybe it’s not as big of a problem.”\nJasmine Enberg, principal analyst at Emarketer, highlighted a paradox: Only the largest, most dominant tech giants may have the resources to buy TikTok. But it may be they who would attract the most regulatory skepticism.\n“Any potential buyer must have deep pockets and a strong stomach,” Enberg said. “While many would want to get their hands on TikTok’s coveted algorithm, most of those who could afford to buy the app wouldn’t be able to clear antitrust hurdles.”\nMicrosoft recently attracted heaps of antitrust scrutiny when it sought to buy the video game publisher Activision Blizzard in one of the largest tech mergers in history. But it ultimately overcame an FTC lawsuit and placated other international regulators to close the blockbuster deal last fall.\nFresh off that success, Microsoft could find itself with a renewed opportunity to strike a deal with TikTok. While Microsoft owns LinkedIn, a social network geared to professionals, it doesn’t have an app like TikTok in its portfolio.\nMicrosoft had been one of the handful of contenders to buy TikTok in 2020 when President Donald Trump first pushed for a sale. The negotiations had also involved Walmart, which said at the time it was partnering with Microsoft on a possible deal.\nBoth companies dropped their efforts after TikTok agreed to work with Oracle on Project Texas, the initiative by TikTok to store US user data on Oracle-owned servers and that was intended to satisfy US national security concerns.\nFour years later, with TikTok’s future in doubt, so is the fate of Project Texas, and that means those who had previously expressed interest in TikTok may have another shot. And Oracle, too.\nIn a move that caught many by surprise, former Trump Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced last month that he is putting together a team of investors to buy TikTok.\nThe exact details of Mnuchin’s offer are hazy, though he has reportedly suggested a deal could exclude TikTok’s powerful content algorithm that has formed the basis of its popularity. That might get around Chinese government export restrictions on recommendation algorithms, but would essentially mean buying only TikTok’s brand and leaving its most treasured asset off the table.\nThe unusual pitch has already raised eyebrows: Mnuchin helped lead the Trump administration’s effort to ban TikTok the first time around. Mnuchin has said publicly that that experience gave him a deep understanding of TikTok and how it operates, including the data it collects on users.\nThat Mnuchin may now leverage that inside knowledge for his own potential benefit reflects a conflict of interest, some critics say.\nRelated article\nBanning TikTok would hit China’s tech ambitions and deepen the global digital divide\nIt would be a “disgrace if [Mnuchin] was allowed to turn around and use that classified information to further enrich himself and his Saudi buddies,” Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden told The Washington Post last month.\nBuying TikTok would also turn Mnuchin into a rival to Trump, who is the chairman and leading shareholder of the company that owns Truth Social, a social media platform where Trump is its most popular user.\nOther businessmen who’ve expressed interest include Kevin O’Leary, the Canadian chairman of the private venture capital firm O’Leary Ventures. As with Mnuchin, O’Leary has said a potential acquisition of TikTok may have to exclude TikTok’s algorithm. His suggested opening bid? Between $20 billion and $30 billion.\n",

    "content": "Move over Met Gala. On Saturday, stars gathered on the steps of The Music Center in Los Angeles for the Gold Gala — a celebration of Asian Pacific influential talent across entertainment, fashion, technology and more, hosted by the non-profit Gold House.\nAnd they were dressed to represent — many proudly embracing Asian designers and cultural heritage through their red carpet looks.\nActor Karrueche Tran stunned in a striking red ao dai with a sheer overlay and headpiece by Vietnamese American fashion designer Thai Nguyen. “I knew I had to represent my culture, half of who I am, in a major way,” she wrote on Instagram. Tran has a Vietnamese mother and African American father.\nTaiwanese drag queen Nymphia Wind, who recently won “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” told CNN that her ensemble by Singaporean designer Sheng Cheong — a dress and cape featuring a bold print of neon yellow and white “laser cut clouds” — was intended to “reimagine what club kids would look like in the Forbidden City.”\nElsewhere, Bollywood filmmaker Karan Johar wore an ornately embroidered suit jacket by Rimple and Harpeet — an Indian fashion brand that specializes in handcrafted pieces inspired by ancient crafts and vintage textiles — and Indonesian singer Agnez Mo accessorized with golden hair pins and an elegant hand fan.\n“Anything goes here and that’s what is so celebratory,” TV personality Jeannie Mai told CNN of the event, which is sometimes described as the “Asian Pacific Met Gala.” “It’s the one place where you can really represent and be invited to do so.”\nThe glitzy affair honors the Gold House’s annual A100 list — one hundred Asian Pacific leaders who have made a significant impact on culture and society. Author and TV host Padma Lakshmi, actor Lucy Liu and the cast and creator of Netflix’s Emmy-award winning series “Beef” were among honorees.\nFor actor and comedian Joel Kim Booster, the significance of a gala feting so many people in the AAPI community, was not lost.\n“Events like this are so exciting to me because when I was coming up, I think there was a lot of energy like, there’s only going to be one of us in the room,” he said.\n“It’s so rewarding to be in a space like this where we’re all coming together and supporting each other. It’s not something that I grew up imagining I’d have for myself.”\nThere have been barriers across industries; in Hollywood, Asians have historically been underrepresented or stereotyped. But that has changed in recent years.\nA joint study by Gold House and the USC Annenberg found the percentage of speaking Asian characters in top box-office films in the US rose from 3.4% in 2007 to 15.9% in 2022. The roles themselves are more complex.\nThe age of streaming has also ushered in more opportunities for diverse and daring storytelling — on and off screen.\nFX’s Shogun, for example, became an instant hit when it premiered in February. Not only does it feature a predominantly Asian cast who speak mostly in Japanese — behind the scenes, Japanese experts in everything from samurai dramas to a “master of gesture,” were brought in to ensure authenticity.\n“I think what the industry has realized is that Asian creativity and Asian talent is a) different and b) lucrative. So that’s been wonderful to see people take chances, and how we’ve knocked it out of the park,” Lakshmi told CNN.\nMany acknowledge there’s more work to be done all around.\n“It’s an exciting time to see the Asian diaspora coming together to really tell our own stories, in our time, in our space,” said fashion designer and the gala’s creative director Prabal Gurung.\n“It’s great to see that visibility. There’s a long way to go still, obviously we feel that way. But progress is being made.”\n",

    "content": "Former President Donald Trump's has become the first former U.S. president to be convicted of criminal charges, and the verdict has sparked a mixed reaction online from celebrities and notable figures.\nTrump was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records in connection to a $130,000 hush money payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 campaign. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges against him in the indictment brought against him by the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. He will face sentencing on July 11.\n\"This was a disgrace,\" Trump said in a statement Thursday evening. \"This was a rigged trial by a conflicted judge that was corrupt.\"\n\"The real verdict is going to be November 5 by the people,\" he added. \"And they know what happened here, and everybody knows what happened here...I'm a very innocent man, and it's okay, I'm fighting for our country. I'm fighting for our Constitution. Our whole country is being rigged right now.\"\nThe 12-person jury's verdict garnered reaction from figures like Tucker Carlson, a conservative political commentator who said that Trump's conviction marks \"the end of the fairest justice system in the world.\"\n\"Import the Third World, become the Third World,\" Carlson wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"That's what we just saw. This won't stop Trump. He'll win the election if he's not killed first. But it does mark the end of the fairest justice system in the world. Anyone who defends this verdict is a danger to you and your family.\"\nFormer Republican presidential candidate and Trump supporter Vivek Ramaswamy also rebuked Thursday's guilty verdict, writing on X, \"Trump led criminal justice reform. Now he's suffering criminal *injustice* at the highest level.\"\n\"One of surprising effects of this sham verdict: more black voters will flock to Trump in droves & for good reason,\" Ramaswamy added. \"I didn't think the Democrat Party would be so dumb, but here we are.\"\nDonald Trump Jr., the former president's eldest son, posted, \"Such bull****.\"\nOther celebrities welcomed the conviction, including American actor Rob Reiner, who posted to X, \"GUILTY!!!!!\"\n\"Guilty on all counts,\" wrote Billy Baldwin, an American actor and producer. \"E. Jean Carroll ✅ Stormy Daniels ✅ Election interference, espionage and inciting an insurrection coming up.\"\n\"Dear #MAGA,\" added author Don Winslow. \"Guilty 34 times. All best, Don Winslow.\"\nFormer Minnesota Senator Al Franken, a Democrat, also celebrated Trump's guilty verdict but noted that the conviction also marks a \"sad day\" for the United States.\n\"This is a great day because justice prevailed; Trump was found guilty on all 34 counts,\" Franken wrote on X. \"But a sad day because we have a former president who committed several crimes.\"\n\"If this had gotten out before the '16 election, if they hadn't paid off Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougall, I believe we would have avoided a Trump presidency,\" he added. \"The job now is to prevent another Trump presidency.\"\nMichael Cohen, Trump's former attorney who served as a key witness in the hush money trial, told Newsweek on Thursday that the former president's verdict \"is an important day for accountability and the rule of law.\"\n\"While it has been a difficult journey for me and my family, the truth always matters,\" Cohen added. \"I want to thank my attorneys Danya Perry and Joshua Kolb for their invaluable guidance and support throughout this process.\"\nIt's unclear if Trump's verdict will impact his chances for reelection. Some experts previously told Newsweek that his conviction could complicate his 2024 campaign. Polling has also indicated that a significant number of American voters will consider Trump's verdict when casting a ballot this November.\nIn one survey by Marquette Law School, which was conducted earlier this month while the hush money trial was ongoing, 44 percent of voters said that they would vote for the former president if he was found not guilty, while 38 percent said they would vote for President Joe Biden if Trump was acquitted.\nHowever, in the case that Trump was found guilty, only 39 percent of those surveyed said they would vote for the former president, with 43 percent choosing Biden.\nUpdate 5/30/24, 6:53 p.m. ET: This story has been updated with additional information and background.\n",

    "content": "It is one of the world’s oldest running annual sporting fixtures which, over the years, has featured a British Prime Minister, international cricketers and the Romantic poet Lord Byron.\nFor more than 200 years, Eton and Harrow – two of England’s most expensive private schools – have faced off against each other at Lord’s, the cricket ground in North London steeped in history and referred to as the “home of cricket.”\nBut the fixture has become increasingly controversial and indicative of many British institutions’ attempts to reconcile their traditions with becoming more inclusive. The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which owns Lord’s, sought to axe the match from the ground’s schedule before granting it a reprieve after some of its members protested.\nThose arguing for its removal expressed “an appetite to promote cricket as a game for all and as a place where all feel welcome” while those against it stressed the need to maintain “the Club’s history and traditions,” as an MCC statement put it.\nAs a compromise, the MCC announced in March that it would host both the Eton vs. Harrow and Oxford vs. Cambridge fixtures for another five years, before another consultation with members.\nThe club will also host the finals of the UK’s school and university cricket competitions, rather than only the historic fixtures.\nActor, presenter and writer Stephen Fry, the current president of the MCC, called on members last year, in an interview with British newspaper The Times, to support stopping the match at Lord’s to help cricket “lose that image it sometimes still has – a turgid image of snobbery and elitism.”\n“That’s not what cricket is about,” he added. “It’s the second most popular sport in the world and it needs people to understand what a wonderful game it is, and how it’s available for everybody.”\n“No-one could have foreseen quite how divided the Club became on this issue,” MCC chair Bruce Carnegie-Brown said in a statement in March, “and the Committee deserves credit for implementing a pragmatic solution that gives those divisions the opportunity to heal, yet also leaves a sensible review mechanism in place.”\nFor the moment, the schoolboys of Eton and Harrow continue to play each other every year on the hallowed, carefully maintained grass at Lord’s. They took to the field on Friday and Harrow emerged victorious by just four runs.\n",

    "content": "(CNN) — At the premiere of his new film “Poolman” in Los Angeles on Wednesday night, Chris Pine stepped onto the red carpet in an artfully-disheveled ensemble. (Or perhaps just disheveled, for less charitable fashion critic.)\nOver a light beige slogan tee, Pine wore a “Miami Vice”-worthy blazer accessorized with a large pink peony boutonnière. He paired this with corduroy work shorts, a pair of well-worn hiking boots (with bright red laces that complemented the stripe detailing on his sports socks) and a pair of chunky mirrored sunglasses. His beard had grown in long and silver, his hair longer still with tousled ends creating an ombre effect.\nRelated article\nLook of the Week: Chris Pine ushers in sweater weather with a chaotic workout look\nThough his years in Hollywood have provided ample evidence that Pine can shine in the scrubbed-up suiting traditionally expected of leading men on press tours, front rows and at A-List events, he’s often been known to playfully incorporate louche tailoring and bohemian accessories into his outfits.\nAnd there have been multiple occasions, when snapped ‘off the clock,’ in which his aesthetic has skewed further into an eccentric, counter-cultural space; very much a ‘last clean clothes in the closet’ vibe from someone who can surely afford dry cleaning.\nBut isn’t there a subversive joy in a day spent in comfy sweatpants, let alone a day running errands — and under the paparazzi’s glare — in said sweatpants? Pine would seem to think so.\nOn the “Poolman” red carpet, the 43-year-old actor told E! of his look, and his outlook on fashion more broadly, that he has reached “a certain wonderful point in your life… where you don’t give as much of a FU anymore.” He cited “an 80s thing” as a style reference, and sartorial stars of that era like Tom Selleck and Harrison Ford.\nPine also noted that his effortless, eclectic personal style had also been inspired by his “Poolman” character — a Los Angeles swimming pool cleaner, as the film’s title suggests. So could this be another moment for “method dressing,” snuck under the style pack’s noses for months? If so, it marks Pine as one of the most fervent followers of the practice, dedicated to a fault — and then some.\n",

However, he's going to be out significantly longer than the minimum two weeks.\nYankees manager Aaron Boone spoke to reporters ahead of the team's series finale against the Los Angeles Angeles on Thursday, and said Schmidt won't throw for 4-6 weeks. Schmidt had an MRI on Wednesday, saw Dr. Neal ElAttrache on Thursday, and they determined \"it's going to be a while\" until Schmidt returns to the mound. Obviously, if Clarke isn't throwing for 4-6 weeks, it's going to be significantly longer until he's back with the ball club.\nThis is a huge blow for the Yankees and their dominant rotation. The Yankees are in the midst of MLB history with 16 consecutive starts of five or more innings while allowing two or fewer runs. This streak began back on May 12 and has continued through Wednesday night's 2-1 win over the Angels.\nSchmidt has made three dominant starts over the last few weeks, which have contributed to a breakout year for the 28-year-old out of Acworth, Georgia.\nThe former first-round pick in 2017 has made 11 starts this season and has a 2.52 ERA, which is top 10 in the American League among qualified pitchers.\nHowever, he'll now miss a good chunk of the season and will be replaced by right-handed pitcher Cody Poteet for now, according to Boone.\nThere may be a new replacement on the horizon, though...\nWhile the Clark injury is tough news for the Yankees and their rotation, Boone did have an exciting update on the status of right-handed pitcher Gerrit Cole.\nCole, who hasn't pitched this season due to elbow discomfort, has been nearing a return and could make a rehab assignment as soon as this coming week, per Chris Kirschner of The Athletic.\nMore news: MLB Power Rankings: Yankees Rise, Dodgers and Rangers Plummet in Another Wild Week\nCole will likely need multiple rehab starts before he's able to return, but this puts him in line to return sometime in June, which has been the hope all along.\nCole made an appearance at Yankee Stadium last week in which he threw a 20-pitch live batting practice session, and came out of it feeling great. The next step will be a few rehab assignments, and then the reigning American League Cy Young award winner will be able to return to the Yankees.\n",

This new kickoff rule was implemented to mitigate the low amount of kickoff returns the NFL saw in 2023, but the rule is also aiding teams in rethinking their entire special teams strategy.\nRead more: NFL News: Breakdown of Wild Proposed Kickoff Rule for 2024 Season\nPer the new kickoff rule, the kicker of the kicking team will kick off from their own 35-yard line. This is not much of a big change, but things get far trickier. The kicking team's other players will then line up on the receiving team's 40-yard line, while the receiving team will have a minimum of nine players line up anywhere from their own 30 to 35-yard line.\nThe new rule is meant to essentially shorten the field to also mitigate potential injuries from players having to spring nearly the entire length of the football field. The issue with this new way of kicking leaves the kicker by themselves as the last line of defense, should the returner get past the wall of the kicking team's defenders. The likelihood of a returner getting past the defenders might also be heightened with this new kickoff rule.\nBecause of the new rule, teams are already playing around with the idea of changing how they engage in kickoffs. Kansas City Chiefs special teams coordinator Dave Toub broke down the new ideas for kickers to reporters on Thursday.\nToub stated, \"I like to have somebody who can go back and is able to make a tackle,\" Toub explained Thursday. \"(Harrison) Butker is able to make a tackle, but I really don't want him making tackles all year long. If you watch the XFL, we watched every play, I bet kickers were involved in at least 25 to 40 percent of the tackles. In either trying to make a guy bounce back or making the tackle himself, or just missing the tackle. We don't want Butker in that situation. But he will be a kicker.\"\nToub also revealed that the Chiefs are playing with the idea of using defensive back Justin Reid in kickoff stations instead as he \"can go down there and make tackles.\"\nWhat makes this situation a bit more interesting for the Chiefs is that Butker recently made headlines for his commencement speech that was widely considered controversial. Butker's socially conservative comments were critical of Pride Month, implying that it is, \"the deadly sin sort of pride that has an entire month dedicated to it.\" He also implied that women should not enter the workforce and instead focus on being mothers.\nThe NFL was quick to make a statement about Butker's comments, stating, \"His views are not those of the NFL as an organization.\"\nChiefs players and head coach Andy Reid also stated their piece about the situation, with most stating they did not agree with Butker. So far, the NFL has not come down with any punishment for Butker because of his comments. However, it is a bit oddly timed that the team is now considering replacing him on the special teams front.\n",

Video from local news stations showed police in riot gear lined up on the campus on Saturday after protesters began erecting tents on Friday.\nOfficers in headgear and carrying shields began to clear the clear the encampment on Saturday afternoon. Videos on social media showed protesters were pushed to the ground, dragged by their arms and sprayed with chemical irritants.\nA spokesperson for the Virginia State Police told Newsweek that pepper spray was \"the only chemical aerosol\" deployed against protesters.\nUniversity President Jim Ryan said in a message to the school community that when Tim Longo, the chief of the university police department, approached the students \"reminding them once again of their university policy violations and pleading for a peaceful resolution,\" the request was ignored. Ryan said the university has a \"long-standing prohibition on erecting tents absent a permit.\"\nRyan said that \"when UPD's attempts to resolve the situation were met with physical confrontation and attempted assault, it became necessary to rely on assistance from the Virginia State Police.\"\nPolice \"declared an unlawful assembly, issued no-trespass orders to those who refused to disperse, and arrested those who continued to refuse dispersal,\" he added.\nRyan said he recognized that some would disagree with the decision to call in police, adding that the \"entire episode was upsetting, frightening and sad\" and \"an aberration.\"\nThe student protesters said that police had responded violently to a peaceful protest.\nOfficers \"brought these weapons to a peaceful encampment,\" the UVA Encampment for Gaza account wrote on X, formerly Twitter, alongside a photo of an officer carrying an assault-type rifle. \"They beat us. They maced us. They brutalized us.\"\nStudents for Justice in Palestine at the University of Virginia shared a video on Instagram showing state police pointing guns at protesters, noting that it came on the anniversary of the Kent State massacre—when the Ohio National Guard opened fire on unarmed college students during an anti-war protest at Kent State University in 1970, killing four and injuring nine.\nThey wrote that white nationalists and neo-Nazis who had marched on the university's campus in 2017 were not met with a similar police response.\n\"Dozens of riot police were deployed to a small Gaza solidarity encampment,\" the post's caption said. \"In 2017, hundreds of neo-Nazis and antisemites descended on UVA campus in a deadly convergence entitled 'Unite the Right,' where Heather Heyer was murdered. The fascists' only opponents were militant antifascists. Now, UVA admin is unleashing riot police on peaceful anti-genocide protesters.\"\nHeyer was killed and 19 others were injured when a car plowed into counter-protesters who had taken to the streets to decry the white nationalist rally.\nNewsweek has contacted UVA and Virginia State Police for comment via email.\nOthers also took to social media to condemn police for treating student protesters more harshly than those involved in the 2017 rally.\n\"Happening at UVA in Charlottesville, police in riot gear are moving in to arrest protesters,\" Alejandra Caraballo, a clinical instructor at the Harvard Law School's Cyberlaw Clinic, wrote on X alongside a video showing officers dragging a person away from the encampment. \"Remember when neo-Nazis openly chanted 'Jews will not replace us' and the police did nothing?\"\nJoshua P.

    "content": "When the e-scooter company Matt Gialich used to work for had to pause production owing to a shortage of platinum, a key component for the microprocessor that translates commands from the controls to the motor, he went down a rabbit hole researching metals.\nGialich, whose childhood love of space led him into engineering and a job at the satellite launch company Virgin Orbit before its bankruptcy, began wondering how to extract the metal in asteroids. Scientists believe these chunks of celestial debris, which are by-products from the birth of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago, are rich in metals that are in short supply on Earth.\nIn 2022, Gialich and Jose Acain, who has almost a decade of experience at SpaceX and NASA, founded AstroForge. Now the California-based startup is attempting to make asteroid mining a reality.\nThe company isn’t alone. The clean energy transition is expected to cause demand for mineral resources to soar, and interest in extracting them from previously untapped sources, like the ocean floor and space, is growing. Companies across the world have raised tens of millions of dollars to test asteroid-mining technologies.\nSome say the idea is a prohibitively expensive, far-fetched fantasy. But 38-year-old Gialich thinks it could be put into practice soon. “Going out and securing resources from space is this Holy Grail,” he says. “I think we’re finally at this inflection point where we can take it on.”\nGialich has no problem admitting that his company’s plans are ambitious. “We’re going to have a lot of failures,” he says.\nAstroForge is, in short, attempting to send into space a tiny refinery that can extract minerals out of an asteroid, then bring the valuable metals back to Earth, leaving the rest. The company is targeting M-type, or metallic, asteroids for platinum group metals (PGMs), which are used in everything from jewelry to catalytic converters that filter car exhaust to cancer-fighting drugs.\nPGMs like platinum and iridium are also critical raw materials for emerging clean energy technologies. Green hydrogen production, for example, is expected to drive major growth in demand for the minerals. But earthly supplies are limited and geographically concentrated.\nAlthough it sounds like a plot straight from the latest season of the Apple TV+ show “For All Mankind,” which involved an elaborate plan to harness an asteroid and bring it into Earth’s orbit for mining, Gialich says “that’s not what we’re doing at all.”\nLast April, AstroForge launched its inaugural mission, called Brokkr-1, sending a miniature satellite equipped with a refinery system about the size of two loaves of bread into space. The spacecraft carried pre-loaded, asteroid-like material it planned to vaporize and sort into elemental components while in orbit.\nRelated article\nThis ‘GigaFarm’ in the desert could produce 3 million kilograms of food\nIt hasn’t gone quite as planned, and the refinery demonstration hasn’t happened yet. But Gialich says the company learned a lot, like how any equipment sourced from vendors would perform, and if the machine could survive blastoff and send signals back from space.\nThe refinery – which AstroForge has patents on – has already been tested terrestrially in space-like conditions, he says. That makes AstroForge the only company with a refinery that can turn M-type asteroids into PGMs in space, he adds.\nThis year, an AstroForge spacecraft will hitch a ride on a mission by US-space exploration company Intuitive Machines to the Moon. But AstroForge will jump ship and use its own propulsion system to fly by an asteroid it thinks is metallic to check out its composition and take pictures. (Gialich declined to specify which asteroid the company is targeting.) If this mission succeeds, it will make AstroForge the first commercial company to venture into deep space, it says. It could also provide the first high resolution images of a metallic asteroid.\nInterest in asteroids – both for better understanding Earth’s origins and their composition, which could lay the groundwork for miners – is skyrocketing, and experts say asteroid mining may just be a matter of time.\nDan Britt, the director of the Center for Lunar and Asteroid Surface Science at the University of Central Florida, who is not directly involved with AstroForge, ponders: “I suppose you could ask whether [humans] are totally crazy to do this. The answer is, it might be a bit early, but we’re not totally crazy.”\nThe likes of JAXA, Japan’s space agency, and NASA have already brought asteroid samples back to Earth, proving, at least to an extent, that it can be done.\nChina plans to launch a mission in 2025 to collect samples from a near-Earth asteroid, while the United Arab Emirates’ Space Agency is planning to explore the asteroid belt with a mission scheduled to launch in 2028.\nNASA has a spacecraft en route to asteroid Psyche, which is orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter, but it won’t get there until 2029. By some estimates, the iron in the 140-mile-wide metal-rich asteroid is worth $10,000 quadrillion – more than the value of the entire global economy. (Gialich says that NASA scientists have been excellent allies, providing invaluable expertise to AstroForge.)\nSome in the scientific community are skeptical that the private sector will be able to afford asteroid mining. NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission, the first US mission to collect an asteroid sample and bring it back to Earth, cost hundreds of millions of dollars, excluding launch cost. Its return of just 122 grams, which landed in a Utah desert last year, is the largest asteroid sample ever collected.\nRelated article\nJetZero: Groundbreaking ‘blended-wing’ demonstrator plane cleared to fly\n“This actually is not a question of if it can be done from a physics standpoint,” says Gialich. “It’s a question of can you do it so it makes any monetary sense.”\nOthers have tried and failed. Planetary Resources, for example, launched in 2012 with the backing of high-profile investors including “Titanic” director James Cameron and Google co-founder Larry Page. By 2020, it was holding an online fire sale after facing funding difficulties and being acquired by a blockchain firm. (Buyers in the Internet auction scored items like a plastic tub full of assorted, tangled electrical cords for $10 and a pair of well-used insulated gloves for $20.)\nA lot has also changed. Private companies like SpaceX have dramatically decreased the cost of space travel. Gialich says today more is known about the solar system’s 1.3 million asteroids, so companies like his don’t have to waste resources looking for them, and that AstroForge has invested in developing algorithms that allow it to rideshare and get where it’s trying to go.\n“Lower transportation costs are key to developing an off-world economy,” says Britt, who has contributed to four NASA missions, including a flyby of an asteroid in the Kuiper Belt, a donut-shaped ring of debris at the edge of the solar system, and a series of journeys to asteroids near Jupiter, and has an asteroid named after him for his contributions to asteroid research.\nThe changes have driven a wave of new interest. Other companies, like Los Angeles-headquartered TransAstra and China-based Origin Space, are working on technologies that can mine resources in space.\nSo far, AstroForge has raised $13 million in seed funding. It says its second mission will cost less than $10 million, which means the company will be putting most of its eggs in one basket. “These are high-risk, high-reward ventures, to be very clear,” says Gialich.\nHe doesn’t yet have a plan B if the planned missions aren’t successful. “Who cares? You go out and you try these big missions, these big gambles, and if it doesn’t work, I don’t know. I guess I go get a job somewhere?” he says. “I’m just focused on plan A and trying to make that happen.”\nIf all goes well, the company’s eventual aim is to bring back about 1,000 kilograms (2,200 pounds) of PGMs per mission, a payload which could be worth around $70 million, depending on the metals and their price at the time. “Even with multiple hiccups in our schedule, we are attempting to mine an asteroid and we’ll have brought it back before the end of this decade,” Gialich says.\nBecause the company is targeting relatively smaller asteroids, it says there will be less gravity to overcome, and therefore less fuel to burn.\nIts all-or-nothing, lower-cost approach may help push asteroid mining closer to reality.\n“Even if we’re not successful and we fail as a company, I hope that we push this forward a little bit,” he says, and demonstrate that “you can do a lot more science with a lot less capital.”\nBritt says asteroid mining is likely to “happen eventually” and the technology in the market is already a lot more advanced than “a soggy bar napkin with a bunch of equations and diagrams drawn on it.”\nBut he expects that technologies will need to advance even further before investors are willing to put big chunks of capital behind it.\n“That’s one of the things that startups like AstroForge are doing – creating that new technology and engineering,” Britt says.\nIt may be years before we know if AstroForge’s attempts have a lasting impact on the wider push to extract minerals from space. But its moonshot approach is likely to be remembered. “I hope if nothing else,” Gialich says, “we’re known as a space company that went for it.”\n",

    "content": "An incredibly rare Roman-era object—made from a substance that was once worth more than its weight in gold—has been discovered at an archaeological site in the United Kingdom.\nThe item was unearthed during excavations conducted in 2023 by archaeologists and volunteers at the site of a Roman bathhouse located within the grounds of a sports club in the city of Carlisle, northern England.\nTesting of the lump—made from a soft, mysterious, purple substance—subsequently revealed that it contained beeswax and an element known as bromine. This is a strong indication that it represents a solid sample of Tyrian purple—a man-made pigment that was highly valued in the ancient world.\nThe dye, which is purple in color, is secreted by several species of predatory sea snails that are found in the Mediterranean region. Producing Tyrian purple was an extremely difficult task. The process was complex and required the collection of thousands of marine snails. In fact, it is estimated that it up to 12,000 individual mollusks would need to be processed to produce just 1 gram of dye.\nAs a result, it was extremely expensive during Roman times, to the extent that it was worth more than gold, pound-for-pound. The pigment was generally reserved for use by the upper echelons of society.\n\"For millennia, Tyrian purple was the world's most expensive and sought after color,\" Frank Giecco, an archaeologist with mining consultancy company Wardell Armstrong, which has been involved in excavations at the Carlisle site, said in a press release.\nFinding a solid sample, such as the one from Carlisle, is a particular unusual find, according to Giecco.\n\"It's the only example we know of in Northern Europe—possibly the only example of a solid sample of the pigment in the form of unused paint pigment anywhere in the Roman Empire,\" Giecco said in the release. \"Examples have been found of it in wall paintings (like in Pompeii) and also some high status painted coffins from the Roman province of Egypt.\"\nTyrian purple is thought to have first been manufactured in the 2nd millennium B.C. by the Phoenicians—an ancient civilization of the Mediterranean region that originated in the coastal Levant region, primarily in an area that is now occupied by modern Lebanon.\nThe purple pigment was most famously produced in Tyre—a city located in Lebanon that is one of the oldest continuously inhabited settlements in the world. However, it was also manufactured in other regions of the Mediterranean, such as North Africa.\nThe Tyrian purple sample from Carlisle was likely used for painting frescos, Sarah Irving, a spokesperson for Cumberland Council, which has partnered with Wardell Armstrong on the excavation project, told Newsweek.\nSometimes the pigment was used to paint walls in grand public buildings, as well as the homes and properties of the elite. However, it was also used to dye clothes.\nExcavations at the site of the Roman bathhouse have unearthed more than 2,800 significant finds to date, including hundreds of coins, carved gemstones and two monumental stone heads.\n\"Following the discovery of the two Roman monumental heads and the other precious items, the project is unearthing some fascinating and globally significant finds. More digs are planned, as well as the opportunity to visit the site and see the ground breaking work underway,\" Cumberland Council councilor Anne Quilter said in the press release.\nBritain was occupied by Rome from A.D. 43 to A.D. 410—with Carlisle located along Hadrian's Wall, which marked the boundary between the empire and the unconquered territories to the north.\n",

The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which owns Lord’s, sought to axe the match from the ground’s schedule before granting it a reprieve after some of its members protested.\nThose arguing for its removal expressed “an appetite to promote cricket as a game for all and as a place where all feel welcome” while those against it stressed the need to maintain “the Club’s history and traditions,” as an MCC statement put it.\nAs a compromise, the MCC announced in March that it would host both the Eton vs. Harrow and Oxford vs. Cambridge fixtures for another five years, before another consultation with members.\nThe club will also host the finals of the UK’s school and university cricket competitions, rather than only the historic fixtures.\nActor, presenter and writer Stephen Fry, the current president of the MCC, called on members last year, in an interview with British newspaper The Times, to support stopping the match at Lord’s to help cricket “lose that image it sometimes still has – a turgid image of snobbery and elitism.”\n“That’s not what cricket is about,” he added. “It’s the second most popular sport in the world and it needs people to understand what a wonderful game it is, and how it’s available for everybody.”\n“No-one could have foreseen quite how divided the Club became on this issue,” MCC chair Bruce Carnegie-Brown said in a statement in March, “and the Committee deserves credit for implementing a pragmatic solution that gives those divisions the opportunity to heal, yet also leaves a sensible review mechanism in place.”\nFor the moment, the schoolboys of Eton and Harrow continue to play each other every year on the hallowed, carefully maintained grass at Lord’s.

After the press conference for the fight was randomly canceled, news about the cancelation of the fight began to be rumored. Now, there is finally an answer.\nSadly, McGregor is not going to be fighting at UFC 303, and a new main event has been announced. Though many were clamoring to see the UFC superstar return, the new main event should excite many MMA fans.\nUFC President Dana White announced on hix X page that McGregor suffered an injury and cannot make the fight against Chandler. However, replacing the Irish star is a lightweight heavyweight bout between current champion Alex Pereira and Jiří Procházka.\nPereira is coming off a TKO win against Jamahal Hill, who was also slated to be on UFC 303. Procházka is also coming off a big TKO win of his own against Alexsander Rakic.\nThis will be the second time that Pereira and Procházka will face off against one another, as Pereira secured the lightweight championship back in Nov. 2023, after he won by TKO against Procházka. This is a huge fight on short notice, but it appears that both fighters could have been preparing to step in on short notice, which is why they are taking this fight.\nSpeaking of Hill, White also announced that he would not be fighting at UFC 303, as he suffered a knee injury. Hill was set to fight Carlos Ulberg. Ulberg is now set to face off against Anthony Smith, though the fight is not slated to be the co-main event any longer.\nThe new co-main event for UFC 303 will be a bout between Brian Ortega and Diego Lopes. Ortega is coming off a submission win against Yair Rodriguez, back in February. Lopes is currently on a three-win fight streak, most recently stopping Sodiq Yusuff with a TKO in April.\nLosing the McGregor fight is certainly going to make plenty of hopeful fans upset, but the new main event should be a great fight. Procházka has been attempting to work his way back to a title shot, and now he can seek his revenge against Pereira in two weeks time.\nHill and Ulberg was also slated to be a good fight, but throwing in Ortega and Lopes should make plenty of MMA fans happy.\n",

What we talked this weekend about how bad the economy is for single parents like the one that raised me. We had a lot of conversations around the room about the importance of eliminating 'Bidenomics' and getting inflation back under 2 percent...We had no conversations about the VP pick to be honest with you, to be clear.\"\nAs Scott continued to talk about economic issues, Welker pressed the senator, twice, asking, \"Just to be very clear, it didn't come up at all? Do you think you're on the short list?\"\n\"I hope that the president will choose a person [as vice president] who helps the country unite and heal,\" Scott smiled as he replied. \"I certainly expect to have a decision from the president in the next 60 days or so. He didn't bring it up and I certainly didn't bring it up.\"\nThe senator added: \"I'm just excited that in this nation, a poor kid from South Carolina can rise to the level of being a United States senator. It just tells me that all things are possible for kids growing up in poverty today. Kids growing up today, listen to this show and know, all things are possible in your future.\"\nNewsweek reached out to the Trump campaign Sunday morning for comment. This story will be updated with any provided statements.\nAccording to a copy of this weekend's Republican National Committee (RNC) spring finance retreat program viewed by Reuters, Scott was joined by several other rumored vice-presidential picks.\nNorth Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and J.D. Vance of Ohio, and Representative Elise Stefanik of New York were all expected to attend the private event.\nNoem, however, has seen her chances of becoming Trump's running mate fall dramatically after reports of her shooting her \"untrainable\" dog emerged, according to an online prediction market.\nMost of this weekend's event was held at the Four Seasons hotel in Palm Beach while Trump hosted a fundraising lunch at his Mar-a-Lago estate on Saturday.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, was also scheduled to address the guests at Mar-a-Lago.\nThe donor event was also intended to help the Trump campaign shore up its finances.\nThe presumptive Republican 2024 presidential nominee is facing multiple legal challenges, including his high-profile hush money case involving adult film star Stormy Daniels. Trump has pleaded not guilty to charges that he attempted to influence the 2016 presidential election by reimbursing his lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen for payments to silence Daniels over an alleged 2006 affair she had with Trump. The former president has denied the affair ever took place.\nWith the trial in the case set to last around six weeks, the former president is racking up significant legal fees. He is also facing three other indictments and related trials that could take place this year, and has maintained his innocence in those cases as well.\nThe former president has been paying his lawyers using the Save America political action committee (PAC), which has spent more than $62 million on legal fees since January 2023, Bloomberg noted.\nTrump's campaign and the RNC said on Saturday in a statement that they raised more than $76 million in April, with over half of the contributions coming from small donors. Meanwhile, the former president's campaign and the RNC said early last month that it raised $65.6 million for March.\n",

While originally it had indicators it would be depleted by 2026, new reports estimate it has an extra 10 years of life before running out of money.\nThe move to work later is not just helping Baby Boomers as they look to their own Social Security checks but could have positive effects for younger generations as well, Beene said.\n\"Living expenses aren't getting any cheaper, and many Americans continue to want to maintain the lives they've cultivated and not cut back as much as some prior generations did in retirement,\" Beene said. \"Social Security still has some serious long-term solvency issues to work out, but generations of Americans that work longer are going to be able to help soften the blow of a funding pitfall.\"\nDrew Powers, the founder of Illinois-based Powers Financial Group, said he sees many of his own clients opting to work longer, especially as the look of retirement changes compared to previous generations.\n\"As they say, 70 is the new 60,\" Powers told Newsweek. \"With advancements in healthcare and technology, Baby Boomers today find it easier to work at an age where their parents, the Greatest Generation, would have found it difficult if not impossible. And with a strong economy, there is also a feeling among my clients that if they stay healthy, then there is no reason to retire until the current cycle ends.\"\nMany Baby Boomers aren't necessarily working longer out of their own volition, however. While previous generations often worked for the same employer for decades and received a fixed pension, that employer-provided security is typically gone for today's retirees.\n\"Those pensions were replaced by the 401k, and those accounts have seen multiple boom-bust cycles from the Dot-Com Bubble to the Covid Crash,\" Powers said. \"As the Boomers put off collecting benefits, it helps the Social Security fund from being depleted. Of course, these folks will eventually collect benefits, so the insolvency crisis is always looming.\"\nKevin Thompson, a finance expert and the founder/CEO of 9i Capital, said a large segment of seniors are working because they planned until retirement but failed to think about the day in and day out of life after retirement.\n\"They did a good job planning to retirement, but a poor job planning for retirement, meaning they truly do not know what their day-to-day lives look like and therefore push off the inevitable,\" Thompson told Newsweek.\nStill, Thompson doubts seniors staying in the workforce will have a material impact on Social Security funding in the long run.\n\"The individuals often working are the ones needing to supplement their fixed expenses and are likely taking social security while in the workforce,\" Thompson said. \"The amount of money going back into the system and money coming out of the system will be offset slightly, but not materially.\"\n",

    "content": "A Chinese citizen journalist who has been behind bars for four years over her reporting on the initial Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan is due to be released Monday after serving her sentence, according to supporters and a court verdict.\nZhang Zhan, a former lawyer, was one of the few independent Chinese journalists reporting in Wuhan after the metropolis of 11 million people went into a complete lockdown, offering a rare, unfiltered glimpse into the reality on the ground as Chinese authorities imposed tight censorship on media coverage.\nShe was detained in May 2020 and sentenced months later to four years in prison for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” – a charge commonly used by the Chinese government to target dissidents and human rights activists.\nZhang is due to finish her sentence on Monday, according to the court verdict on her case obtained and published by human rights groups.\nSupporters and rights groups have called on the Chinese government to free Zhang on schedule.\n“So far I have not received any confirmation that Zhang Zhan has left the prison and is home with her family. We are all still waiting,” said Jane Wang, a UK-based advocate for the Free Zhang Zhan campaign.\n“I understand that her parents and brother have been under enormous pressure and warned severely not to give media interviews. Friends’ calls are also left without answers… these are extremely worrying signs,” she added.\nReporters Without Borders (RSF), which awarded Zhang its Press Freedom Award in 2021, called on “the international community to put pressure on the authorities to ensure her unconditional release on Monday,” in a post on social platform X Friday.\nRelated article\nThis Chinese virologist shared crucial Covid-19 data. Then his research hit hurdles\nIn early February 2020, just days after Wuhan went into lockdown, Zhang traveled some 400 miles from Shanghai to the central Chinese city to report on the spread of the virus and subsequent attempts to contain it, just as authorities tightened censorship on state-run and private Chinese media.\nFor more than three months, she documented snippets of life under lockdown in Wuhan and the harsh reality faced by its residents, from overflowing hospitals to empty shops, as the world braced for the spread of the virus. She posted her observations, photos and videos on WeChat, Twitter and YouTube – the latter two of which are blocked in China.\n“I can’t find anything to say because everything is covered up. This is the problem this country is facing now: any opposing opinions from us might be (dismissed as) ‘rumors,’” she said in a video two weeks after arriving in Wuhan, donning a face mask.\n“Even our own voices are out of our control. They imprison us in the name of pandemic prevention and restrict our freedom…If we cannot obtain the truth, if we cannot break their monopoly of the truth, the world will be meaningless to us.”\nHer posts came to an abrupt stop in mid-May, and she was later revealed to have been detained by police and brought back to Shanghai.\nChina’s Foreign Ministry declined to confirm whether Zhang had been released from prison at a regular news conference on Monday afternoon.\n“I don’t know the relevant information, but what I can tell you is that China is a country governed by the rule of law. Anyone who violates the law should be punished by law,” said ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin.\n“At the same time, China fully protects the legal rights of defendants and prisoners in accordance with the law,” he added.\nHuman rights advocates who have long worked on China say Zhang is likely to live under close surveillance from authorities even if she does walk out of prison.\n“While Zhang is released from prison, it won’t mean she will be free,” said Yaqiu Wang, research director for China at advocacy group Freedom House.\n“If the Chinese government’s past record is of any indication, she will face continued harassment and surveillance by authorities. But if Zhang Zhan’s past actions are any indication, she will keep fighting against efforts to silence her.”\nSarah Brooks, Amnesty International’s China director, said she was concerned that Zhang’s ability to travel or to make contact with relatives and others, especially those outside China, may be severely restricted.\n“Zhang Zhan should never have been jailed in the first place; now, having served her time, our hopes are with her and her family for a safe reunion and road back to health and, if she chooses, her important human rights work,” she said.\n“The Chinese government’s jailing of Zhang Zhan has been a shameful assault on her human rights, and her release must mark a new beginning.”\nSupporters and rights groups are also concerned about Zhang’s access to medical treatment upon her release, given her poor health conditions while in prison.\nThe 40-year-old has been on multiple hunger strikes since being detained and was briefly hospitalized. In 2021, Zhang’s mother said her daughter was so frail that she could not hold her head up for lack of strength and was in desperate need of medical care.\nDuring a previous hunger strike, Amnesty International alleged Zhang was shackled and force fed, treatment the group said amounted to torture.\nChina’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not previously respond to CNN on allegations of Zhang’s mistreatment in detention.\nIn a lengthy statement issued in July 2020, the Foreign Ministry denied the Chinese government had cracked down on journalists who “exercised their right to freedom of speech on the Internet” during the pandemic.\n“In China, no one gets punished or penalized simply because of making remarks,” the statement said. “The Chinese government has all along conducted its Covid-19 response in an open and transparent manner, and has made widely recognized achievements.”\nZhang was one of a number of independent reporters who were detained or disappeared during the outset of the pandemic, as Chinese authorities clamped down on coverage of the virus and propaganda outlets went into overdrive portraying Beijing’s response as effective and timely.\nChina is the biggest jailer of journalists in the world, according to Reporters Without Borders, which ranks it at 172 out of 180 countries around the world in its annual Press Freedom Index.\nAuthorities tightly control the press at home while blocking most foreign media outlets via the Great Firewall, its vast online censorship and surveillance apparatus.\n",

    "content": "The venture capital firm backed by Jay-Z is making its way into the red-hot canned cocktail industry, backing a beloved gin-based concoction from Finland that's seeing explosive growth in the U.S. and a growing list of celebrity endorsers.\nLast week, Marcy Venture Partners announced it was making a \"significant\" investment into the ready-to-drink Finnish Long Drink brand.\nThe actor Miles Teller, DJ Kygo, former Boston Bruins goalie Tuuka Rask and professional golfer Rickie Fowler are already partners with the maker of the sipper that's long been popular in its namesake country.\n\"I became an investor in The Finnish Long Drink because I think it's the best in the market and has an authentic backstory,\" Teller said when he increased his investment stake at the beginning of last year. \"It's high-quality stuff and I think consumers deserve a product that's good and refreshing.\"\nThe celebrity partnerships and investments will help Finnish Long Drink (the brand) expand its \"store footprint and marketing efforts,\" according to co-founder and CEO Evan Burns.\n\"It was clear Marcy Ventures saw the same big potential we do in the brand to bring Finland's best kept secret to more Americans,\" Burns told Newsweek.\n\"It was love at first sip. Just have a taste and it's clear why this national treasure of Finland is now storming North America,\" Larry Marcus, the co-founder and managing director of Marcy Ventures, told Newsweek. The firm has not disclosed the specifics of its investment.\nAccording to CB Insights, Finnish Long Drink has now raised over $41 million across 14 rounds of funding.\nThe venture capital firm backed by Jay-Z's investment is significant because of his billion-dollar track record in the alcohol space.\nLast year, he sold his controlling interest in D'USSE Cognac to Bacardi for $750 million.\nMarcy Venture Partners' portfolio include investments in Rihanna's Savage X Fenty lingerie line, streetwear marketplace StockX and robot-powered Stellar Pizza.\nIn 1952, Finland was preparing to receive an influx in tourists for the Helsinki Summer Olympics. In order to help vendors handle the new wave of thirsty customers, Alkoholiliike, the national alcoholic beverage retailing monopoly, introduced two brands of pre-mixed, ready-to-drink gin cocktails known in Finland as \"long drinks.\" (That's the \"legend of 1952\" reference printed on each Finnish Long Drink can.)\nIn Finland, the \"long drink,\" or \"lonkero\" which literally means tentacle, is commonly made with grapefruit soda and gin, though many add touches like cranberry juice and lime.\nAfter Finland joined the European Union in 1995, the government was no longer allowed to control the production of the drinks on its own, and several long drink brands were born.\nDespite the cocktail's popularity overseas — it's also sold in China, Japan and Taiwan — it's path in the U.S., where the canned cocktail and hard seltzer market has become extraordinarily crowded, is far from certain. Boston Beer, the alcohol behemoth and parent company of Sam Adams, tried marketing a brand called Bevy Long Drink that was pulled off shelves last year due to lack of sales.\nStill, the beverage maker has already seen staggering growth stateside, selling 1.8 million cases last year, up from 33,000 in 2019. Sales grew 114 percent from 2021 to 2022, the company told Newsweek. Through mid-April, retail sales were up 92 percent year-over-year, according to NielsenIQ data. Burns said the company sold over 100 million cans in that period.\n\"Our ambition is to ten times the size of the business,\" Burns said. \"People may find that crazy, but the data supports it's possible.\"\nFinnish Long Drink's off-premise sales — such as grocery and liquor stores — have seen triple-digit growth in the last year, per NielsenIQ, far outpacing similar canned cocktails made by better-known brands like Bacardi and Jack Daniel, which also benefit from far greater distribution.\nThe company also touts the \"highest net promoter score in alcohol,\" according to Burns. He said 91 percent of Finnish Long Drink's customers are likely to recommend the beverage to a friend.\n\"Most people don't realize that Long Drinks are bigger to Finns than Guinness is to the Irish,\" Burns said.\nNow Burns is eyeing this summer as a coming out party of sorts for the brand in the U.S.\n\"People are obsessed with the taste, and once they're introduced to what long drinks are and have the chance to try it, they fall in love,\" he said.\n\"It really is like nothing else in the market — the taste is uniquely refreshing which makes Long Drink perfect for a hot summer day be it lakeside, at the beach or by the pool.\"\nUpdate: 5/25/2024, 9:30 p.m.: This article and headline has been updated for clarity.\n",

    "content": "There’s nothing quite like settling back into your train seat, the urban skyline out the window fading into lush natural landscapes as you make your way to your next destination.\nAccording to rail experts, an increasing number of luxury travelers are looking to experience this sensation, all part of a global shift towards slower and more sustainable tourism activities.\nAnantara is among the hospitality giants now tapping into this demand, with the high-end hotel brand offering a new five-hour luxury train experience in southern Vietnam that connects the popular resort destinations of Na Trang and Quy Nhon – its second route in the country.\nThe first “The Vietage by Anantara” luxury train carriage launched in 2020 – a six-hour journey connecting Da Nang and Quy Nhon.\nAnanatara’s head of PR and marketing for Vietnam, Kate Jones tells CNN the new carriage heads in the opposite direction and aims to expose travelers to even more of Vietnam’s beautiful views. Like the first Vietage carriage, it will be attached to Vietnam’s state-run commercial railway that runs up and down the country.\n“The main difference is that the new route connecting Nha Trang and Quy Nhon passes through many more coastal areas than the journey between Da Nang and Quy Nhon,” says Jones.\n“There is a selection of really quite stunning bays and some striking coastline facing the East Sea. There are some mountainous areas and still plenty of rice paddies and lotus ponds, but the coastal scenery is the biggest view ‘pull’ for this five-hour journey.”\nThis is slow travel at its best – the trains hit an average speed of 51.9 kilometers per hour (32.2 mph) according to Anantara.\nThat gives guests on the Quy Nhon-Nha Trang route plenty of time to enjoy their complimentary afternoon tea set, which includes local caviar, Vietnamese artisanal cheeses, a selection of cold cuts and premium Vietnamese teas.\nFor the six-hour journeys between Da Nang and Quy Nhon, passengers are served a pre-ordered three-course gourmet meal.\nGuests on either route also get complimentary snacks, free-flow wine, cocktails, mocktails, teas, coffee and soft drinks, plus a 15-minute head and shoulder treatment.\nThe Vietage carriage is fitted out with a sit-up bar, restroom facilities and six private booths that seat two, each of which comes with power outlets, charging stations, free wifi and amenity baskets with pillows, blankets and other essentials.\nTravelers can reserve their seats online at Thevietagetrain.com, while those wanting to combine their rail journeys with a stay at one of Anantara’s properties – – Anantara Hoi An Resort, Anantara Quy Nhon Villas or Avani Quy Nhon Resort – can book packages through those individual hotel websites.\nThe cost of a one-way Vietage journey is $420 per person. The new route departs from Nha Trang Train Station at 2 p.m., arriving at Dieu Tri Station in Quy Nhon at 6:29 p.m. For those preferring to travel in the opposite direction, trains depart Dieu Tri Train Station at 2:15 p.m. - arriving at Nha Trang Train Station at 6:36 p.m.\nRelated article\nThis train route is being revived after over 100 years\nThe original route departs from Da Nang Train Station at 8 a.m., arriving at Quy Nhon’s Dieu Tri Station at 2:03 p.m. There is also an evening option that departs Quy Nhon at 7:00 p.m., arriving in Da Nang at 12:53 a.m. the following day. This Vietage journey is slightly cheaper, costing $315 per passenger.\nAs for demand, Jones says many are turning to rail travel rather than “rushing through airports to get from A to B.”\n“The domestic aviation industry in Vietnam right now is also facing some challenges with the disappearance of two airlines and a reduced fleet with the national carrier, so overall air travel is currently not popular, plus overly expensive,” she says.\n“The Vietage is the only experience of its kind in Vietnam and, of course, with the return of the Belmond train, the awareness of luxury rail travel is growing in Southeast Asia.”\nIn addition to traveling slowly and more sustainably, Jones says rail travelers gain real visual insights into the country, taking in scenes like “rural villages, fishermen casting their nets, farmers in fields with the water buffaloes – things you definitely don’t experience at 35,000 feet.”\n",

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\nUnrest on college campuses is driven in part by an opposition to an unpopular Democratic president’s support for Israel. Add in the fact that Democrats are holding their national convention in Chicago this year, and it’s not hard to hear echoes of 1968, when the protest movement collided with mainstream politics.\nThe pro-Palestinian movement in the US today is a far cry from the anti-war movement of the 1960s, but the angst and frustration of young Americans is clear and growing. It extends far beyond their views of the Middle East, and it is a major threat to President Joe Biden’s campaign to keep Donald Trump from returning to the White House.\nYoung voters are part of Democrats’ natural base of support, but Biden is actually 11 percentage points behind Trump among young voters 18-34 in a head-to-head match in a CNN poll conducted by SSRS and released over the weekend.\nAmong all Americans, about half – 47% of registered voters in CNN’s poll – said they were satisfied with the candidates they have to choose from for president this year. That figure was dragged down by the fact that just 37% of younger voters said they were satisfied.\nWhen other potential candidates are added in, more than one-fifth of registered voters 18-34 say they support Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in his independent bid. Older voters are less likely to say they support Kennedy.\nBiden is under water in every issue asked about in the CNN poll, according to Jennifer Agiesta, CNN’s polling director. Agiesta writes:\nRelated article\nWill the economy affect your vote in November? Share your story\nAnd his worst issue approval rating – for his handling of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza – yields 28% approval to 71% disapproval, including an 81% disapproval mark among those younger than 35 and majority disapproval among Democrats (53%).\nAsked whether they view Biden’s presidency as a success or a failure, 68% of younger Americans said it’s a failure, more than other age groups – and despite his high-profile efforts to address other issues of importance to young voters, including student debt relief.\nBiden fares worse in this poll among young voters than other recent CNN polling, according to Agiesta, although she adds some important context that many young people don’t vote and their views are not consistently reflected in polls.\nAGIESTA: Biden’s deficit with voters in that group is driven largely by those who did not vote in 2020. With that group excluded, voters between the ages of 18 and 34 in this poll divide 46% for Biden to 47% for Trump.\nAlthough not all polls release crosstabs or use the same age breaks when reporting results, other recent polling has shown a wide range of results for younger voters in testing a matchup between Trump and Biden, ranging from an 18-point Trump advantage among those younger than 30 in the Fox News poll in mid-March up to a 21-point Biden advantage among those younger than 30 in the Pew Research survey earlier this month.\nThe Republican pollster Frank Luntz recently shared video with CNN’s Erica Hill of focus groups he conducted with young people in which he asked whether they regard American democracy as strong. Few raised their hands.\n“They don’t like anybody,” Luntz told Hill. “They see Joe Biden as being too old. They see Donald Trump as being corrupt. … They’re looking for a role model, looking for someone to aspire to be. And they don’t see it. And that’s the frustration.”\nIt’s not just Biden and politics that are turning off young Americans. Just 38% of younger Americans in CNN’s poll said they are satisfied with their personal financial situation. Compare that with the 65% of voters 65 and over who are satisfied.\nHarvard University conducts a nationwide poll of young Americans ages 18-29 each year, and in this year’s edition, fewer than 1 in 10 said the nation was headed in the right direction, and 58% said the country was going “off on the wrong track.” Four years ago, more than 20% in the Harvard poll said the country was headed in the right direction.\nThe erosion of optimism among this key group during his presidency will be difficult for Biden and Democrats to correct before Election Day.\n",

    "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\nA spectacular wonder of nature or an anxiety-inducing nuisance? It depends on whom you ask.\nNaturalists have already spotted the first arrivals in a rare phenomenon during which cicadas will emerge this spring across more than a dozen US states — including populous areas like Chicago, Nashville and St. Louis — blanketing eastern parts of the country with billions, perhaps trillions, of the flying bugs.\nThe insects will infiltrate a much bigger geographical area than similar occurrences in most years because they’re part of the dual emergence of two particular periodical cicada broods. These groups of multiple Magicicada species appear like clockwork after a certain number of years, but the simultaneous appearance of these two broods hasn’t happened since 1803.\nThe Northern Illinois brood spends 17 years underground before emerging and is known as Brood XIII, while the Great Southern Brood, or Brood XIX, lives underground for 13 years. The two broods won’t coincide again until 2245.\nAlthough the full-scale emergence isn’t underway yet, experts have some guidance on how to prepare for cicada season.\nWhen small holes that can resemble tiny chimneys appear in the ground near tree roots, it’s a signal periodical cicadas will soon emerge from their underground lair.\nOnce the soil hits the right temperature, around 64 degrees Fahrenheit (17.8 degrees Celsius), cicada babies, called nymphs, begin to burst forth.\nRelated article\nBillions of cicadas are set to appear in a rare ‘double brood emergence,’ scientists say\nAs soon as they’re above ground, the bugs make a beeline for a vertical surface — typically a tree trunk, but it could be a fence. There they shed their hard outer skeletons and spread their wings for the first time before spending four to six weeks in a noisy frenzy of eating, mating and egg laying.\nThe most obvious sign of their arrival is the distinctive sound they make — a droning buzz. The bugs congregate in trees, and the male cicadas form a cacophonous chorus of thousands to attract mates.\n“When they say it’s as loud as a lawn mower, it is as loud as a lawn mower,” said Paula Shrewsbury, a professor in the department of entomology at the University of Maryland.\n“We live near an airport, and when the planes are flying over…cicadas crank up their sound level, it’s like they’re competing with the airplanes for sound,” Shrewsbury said.\nFemale cicadas use an egg-laying organ, called an ovipositor, to lay their eggs inside slits they cut into tree branches.\nHowever, cicadas are unlikely to cause any irreparable damage to plants, trees, vegetable patches or flower beds, said John Lill, a professor of biology at the George Washington University.\nIt’s possible that the insects could damage a very young sapling, and to prevent that you could cover the sapling with protective netting, Lill said.\nRelated article\nA strange fungus could transform emerging cicadas into ‘saltshakers of death,’ scientists say\nCicadas provide an all-you-can-eat buffet for many animals, including pets. Lill said he once had to take his dog to the vet after it gorged itself on cicadas, but the bugs — which are said to have a sweet, nutlike flavor— are not innately harmful when eaten by pets or humans.\n(Some advice for the gastronomically adventurous from the US Food and Drug Administration: Humans with seafood allergies should avoid eating cicadas, which are distantly related to shrimp and lobsters.)\nTry to replace fear with fascination, Lill advised, and remember cicadas, which are about an inch long, don’t bite or sting.\nView the dual emergence as a remarkable opportunity to see a glorious and mysterious natural phenomenon that has delighted people for centuries.\nDownload community science apps such as the Cicada Safari app and take photographs to help researchers studying these insects, which benefit the natural environment where they live: Cicada nymphs loosen and aerate the soil as they tunnel, and, when they die, they add nutrients to the soil.\nMore than 3,000 species of cicadas are found all around the globe, but just nine are periodical and, of those, seven are confined to the eastern United States.\nIt’s not clear why periodical cicadas evolved to emerge every 13 or 17 years. It’s an unusually long lifespan for an insect.\nHowever, for bug haters, Shrewsbury said staying indoors or timing a vacation with the peak of the emergence might be the best strategy.\n“They are so abundant. They’re flying and landing on you. They’re getting caught in your hair,” she added. “If you really are a cicadaphobe, I would plan a trip away.”\n",

    "content": "U.S. Drone Soccer and Robofest transcend the conventional, molding competition and education into a concrete forge where future innovators are tempered. Within these crucibles of creativity and scientific rigor, young minds are not just honed — they are transformed, contesting the orthodoxy that separates the intellectual from the intuitive. Both opportunities herald a paradigm shift in pedagogy, where students engage in entirely new dimensions of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) competitiveness.\nU.S. Drone Soccer is where technology and teamwork ascend to new heights, showcasing a sport redefined by innovation and strategic ingenuity. This competition goes far beyond the traditional confines of athletic endeavor, melding the physical with the intellectual, to craft an environment where students are not just athletes but innovators and strategists. The drone soccer ball, a symbol of technological accessibility and creativity, serves as a testament to the power of STEM education, remodeling students from passive learners into active makers and problem-solvers.\nU.S. Drone Soccer is a well-founded educational experience that challenges students to build, program, and pilot their drones. This hands-on approach not only cements theoretical knowledge but also imbues students with a sense of kinesthetic accomplishment and a drive to explore new technological frontiers. Through the meticulous construction and programming of drones, participants learn the criticality of every component, the value of persistence, and the joy of collective achievement.\nAs educators lead these young innovators through the intricacies of the assembly process and flight dynamics, they are nurturing a future workforce equipped with the skills necessary for the challenges of tomorrow. The U.S. Drone Soccer Association, now boasting over 200 programs nationwide, is working to satisfy the growing demand for immersive, technologically oriented education.\nFrom its inception in early 2020, sparked by the World Air Sports Federation's recognition of the untapped potential within the U.S. market, U.S. Drone Soccer has swiftly ascended from a nascent sport to a national phenomenon — with worldwide ambitions. The establishment of the U.S. Drone Soccer Association and the development of an FAI-compliant drone soccer ball assembly kit mark significant milestones in this journey.\nWith the success of the first-ever National Championship in 2023 and the remarkable triumph of the Sato Academy Red Dragons in international competition, U.S. Drone Soccer has proven its efficacy as a platform for global achievement. The anticipation for the 2024 National Championship, set against the backdrop of Virginia's technological landscape, hints at the burgeoning legacy of this pioneering sport.\nAs we pivot from aerial feats and teamwork epitomized by drone soccer, we turn our gaze to the ground, where another form of competition beckons.\nRobofest, emerging from the ingenuity of Lawrence Technological University, stands as a bastion of innovation and a celebration of the mind's limitless potential. This festival, a symphony of autonomous robotics, unfurls a canvas where students from diverse backgrounds converge to weave the threads of STEAM (STEM + Arts) and computer science into a tapestry of ingenuity and fun. Here, robots become more than metal and code; they are recast as vehicles of learning, embodiments of students' creativity and problem-solving prowess.\nThe historical evolution of Robofest is a narrative of continuous innovation and pedagogical refinement. Since its inception in the 1999-2000 academic year, the festival has been a cradle of self-directed learning, encouraging students to transcend the boundaries of fixed rules and venture into realms of unfettered creativity and innovation. The introduction of the exhibition category and the Unknown Mission Challenge exemplify Robofest's commitment to nurturing critical thinking and adaptability, empowering students to tackle unforeseen challenges with grace and ingenuity.\nAs Robofest evolved, it embraced the arts, merging technology with creativity in RoboParade and the Global Robotics Art Festival, and later, RoboArts. These events exemplify the fusion of engineering and artistry, highlighting the holistic nature of STEAM education and the importance of integrating diverse disciplines to foster well-rounded learning experiences.\nThe small team sizes at Robofest are not by mere chance but by design, ensuring that each participant engages deeply with the material and contributes meaningfully to their team's objectives. This philosophy has cultivated an environment where learning is intimate, collaborative, and profoundly impactful.\nFrom the Vision Centric Challenge, inspired by the DARPA Urban Challenge, to the foundational Robot Sumo and its evolved counterpart, BottleSumo, Robofest has continually expanded its horizons, offering myriad avenues for students to explore, learn, and grow. The WISER conference and collaboration with AccelerateKID stands as a testament to the community's dedication to advancing robotics education, providing a platform for sharing knowledge and fostering a global dialogue on the future of STEAM learning.\nThe journey of Robofest, marked by its adaptability, innovation, and commitment to education, mirrors the broader narrative of technology's role in shaping our future. Here, amidst the buzzing servos and whirring motors, students find not only a competition but a gateway to the future, a place where the lessons of today become the breakthroughs of tomorrow. This convergence of past achievements and future aspirations is not just the story of Robofest but a reflection of the transformative power of education in the technological age.\nAs we close this chapter of innovation and discovery, let it not signify an end but a call to action for the next wave of pioneers in STEM. U.S. Drone Soccer and Robofest are more than competitions; they are catalysts for a collaborative future, a summons to stakeholders at all levels — from vendors and sponsors to mentors, teams, and volunteers — to join hands in shaping the next generation.\nLet this be your invitation to forge the future, to be part of a community dedicated to advancing the frontiers of knowledge and innovation. Dive into the heart of these competitions, lend your expertise, your enthusiasm, and your support. Together, we can build parallel systems that not only celebrate the triumphs of competition but also cultivate the growth of the individuals and teams who will lead us into tomorrow.\n",

The National Coffee Association reported in 2022 that Americans drank about 517 million cups of coffee daily, and the stimulating drink had become increasingly popular among people ages 18 to 24.\nOhlson said she felt like she had no choice but to eliminate caffeine from her diet after noticing several side effects, including eye twitches and gut problems.\n\"Since quitting caffeine, I wake up with more energy. I don't feel the need to drink a coffee first thing in the morning,\" Ohlson said. \"I feel more focused and at ease throughout the day.\"\n\"I had a constant eye twitch and always felt on edge,\" Ohlson said of the effects caffeine had on her. \"Along with anxiety, I noticed gut problems—even when hydrating and eating before consumption—inflammation and acne, and heightened premenstrual syndrome symptoms, such as mood swings, and cramps.\"\nShe added: \"I wanted to feel and look my healthiest. So I decided to see how I would feel without caffeine.\"\nAccording to Johns Hopkins Medicine, coffee has numerous advantages, including increasing vitality and preventing serious illnesses, such as Parkinson's and heart failure. However, it's not the greatest option for anxious individuals.\nAmy Baertschi, a registered dietitian, spoke with Newsweek about the links between coffee and anxiety.\n\"It's important to remember that caffeine is a central nervous stimulant and will raise heart rate, blood pressure, and may cause heart palpitations if consumed in higher doses,\" said Baertschi, who lives in Zurich.\nShe continued: \"For people with preexisting anxiety, adding something that will exacerbate the symptoms of anxiety (such as heart palpitations or increased heart rate) will only make symptoms worse.\"\nDuring the TikTok video, which has received more than 101,000 views and 12,000 likes, Ohlson said quitting caffeine \"cured\" her. She added that she was mentally in a better place and that her skin had \"never been this clear and this glowy.\"\nShe told Newsweek: \"I am a beverage girl. I love waking up and drinking a coffee or juice. The hardest part of giving up caffeine was losing the ritual of it.\"\nAccording to the CDC, three to five cups of plain coffee is OK as part of a healthy diet. Ohlson said she replaced coffee with water that contained electrolytes—though she hasn't ruled out the odd latte as a \"treat.\"\nShe said: \"I also remind myself that everything in moderation is important. I still love coffee, so I opt for decaf when I am craving one. However, I have treated myself to two lattes since March.\n\"Overall, my mental health has been better, and I no longer struggle with horrible anxiety. Of course, I have my day, but when I am anxious, I feel like I have more control and can deal with it a lot easier.\"\nIn the video's comments section, TikTok users shared their experiences quitting caffeine or moderating their intake.\n\"I stopped drinking caffeine on an empty stomach (I knew it was bad for me) and omg my anxiety lessened SO MUCH,\" one user wrote.\n\"Ughhh I'm moody without caffeine I want to but I can't,\" another added.\nA commenter said: \"I did the same thing!!!

Justice Thomas never disclosed these, raising further questions about the accuracy of his disclosures.\"\nJustice Thomas and Crow previously faced criticism after a ProPublica report published in April 2023 detailed \"luxury trips\" accepted by Justice Thomas. Defending the trips, Justice Thomas issued a statement saying in part, \"Early in my tenure at the Court, I sought guidance from my colleagues and others in the judiciary, and was advised that this sort of personal hospitality from close personal friends, who did not have business before the Court, was not reportable.

    "content": "Archaeologists investigating a submerged prehistoric settlement have found that it surprisingly managed to survive a period of climate instability that occurred around 8,200 years ago.\nThe village, dubbed Habonim North, now lies below the Mediterranean Sea off the Carmel Coast of Israel, at a depth of around 8 to 10 feet below the surface. Prior to the latest research, almost nothing was known about the settlement aside from its location.\nBut now a team of experts involving researchers from the University of California, San Diego, as well as the University of Haifa (UH) and Bar-Ilan University in Israel, have begun to unravel its secrets in a study published in the journal Antiquity.\nThe research included the first formal excavation of the submerged site, which was first discovered in the mid-2010s and later identified during a survey led by Ehud Arkin Shalev with UH—one of the authors of the study.\n\"The site was re-discovered during our team's surveys. At first, we thought it was a site related to a later archaeological period,\" Roey Nickelsberg, a Ph.D. candidate with UH's Department of Maritime Civilizations, who co-led the excavations, told Newsweek.\nHowever, after examining the finds, including organic remains that the team managed to radiocarbon date, the researchers determined that the site was occupied during the Early Pottery Neolithic period (around 6400–5500 B.C.) of the southern Levant, around the time of a phenomenon that scientists call the \"8.2 ka\" climatic event.\nNickelsberg said it was \"absolutely a surprise\" to find that Habonim North likely dated to this period.\n\"There are many submerged sites in this area but they are all from a later or earlier period,\" he said. \"And and on land there is very limited evidence for settlement during this period, so to identify an active permanent settlement was surprising and exciting.\"\nThe scarcity of contemporary sites in the region potentially reflects the impact of the 8.2ka event, which as the name suggests, took place around 8,200 years ago—or 6200 B.C. The event was characterized by a sudden drop in global temperatures that may have occurred over the space of just few decades. In total, the event may have lasted for roughly a couple of centuries, or more.\nDuring the event, the eastern Mediterranean region, where Israel lies, experienced increasingly arid conditions, effectively resulting in drought across many areas. This would likely have affected the farming communities that were beginning to emerge during this period.\n\"The impact could have been devastating on Neolithic farming communities,\"\nAssaf Yasur-Landau, head of the Recanati Institute for Maritime Studies at UH, who co-led the excavations at Habonim North, told Newsweek.\nPreviously, archaeologists believed that the climate event may have led to the widespread abandonment of coastal settlements in the southern Levant, such as Habonim North.\n\"During the time period related to the 8.2ka event, there seemed to have been no permanent coastal settlements, and, therefore, it was assumed that the coast was abandoned and then resettled later,\" Nickelsberg said.\nBut the latest study suggests that at least one village remained occupied throughout the period of climate instability.\nThe team's investigations at the site uncovered a variety of remains, including pottery shards, stone tools (such as ceremonial weapons and possible fishing net weights), animal and plant remains, and traces of architecture.\nThe researchers managed to date some of the organic remains using radiocarbon techniques, including those of wild and domesticated animals, as well as the charred seeds of plants. This work—alongside an analysis of the other remains—helped to date the site to the Early Pottery Neolithic, which coincided with the 8.2ka event, not to mention the emergence of pottery in the Levant region.\n\"It was only after our first excavation season when we analyzed the finds and applied radiocarbon dating to the site that we understood the site was in the ballpark of the 8.2ka climate event,\" Tom Levy, a co-author on the paper with the UC San Diego Center for Cyber-Archaeology and Sustainability at the Qualcomm Institute, told Newsweek.\nIt is unclear exactly how the prehistoric inhabitants of Habonim North survived, or even what impacts the 8.2ka event had on them. But the settlement—which had access to marine resources, as well as farmland for growing crops—provides some clues, displaying evidence of a diverse economy.\nThe ability to extract both marine resources (such as fish, shrimp, crab, lobster, clams, mussels, oysters, octopus) and land-based agricultural resources (for example, cereals, meat from wild game and domestic animals, as well as their secondary products, like milk) may have provided these early farmer-fishers with a \"flexible strategy to survive,\" Levy said.\nFurthermore, the inhabitants would have been able to store their surplus with the novel technology of pottery. There is even evidence that the settlement may have engaged in trade or exchange with other communities, which would have boosted its resilience by providing access to additional resource streams.\n\"In Habonim North we have an exciting window into life in a crucial period within the Neolithic—the beginning of the use of pottery,\" Yasur-Landau said. \"The ability to store goods in containers, as well as to cook and serve food in ceramic pots and bowls, changed society for millennia. It's astonishing that even in this very early stage, the pottery at the site came from different sources. It is possible that we have the beginning of trade in both vessels, as well as in agricultural products stored in vessels.\"\nThe results of the study indicate that at least some early Neolithic societies in the region were \"resilient and sustainable\" in the face of abrupt climatic changes, according to the researchers.\n",

CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy.\nDubai is making a splash with its most recent record-setting structure.\nThe newly opened twin skyscrapers One Za’abeel are home to the world’s longest cantilever building and on it, the United Arab Emirates’ longest suspended infinity pool, which is 120 meters (393 feet) in length.\nA cantilever is a structure that is only connected at one end, and projects horizontally unsupported, like a diving board. The one at One Za’abeel is part of a 230-meter-long (755-foot) structure known as “The Link,” with the cantilever projecting 67.5 meters (221 feet) over the city.\nThe Link connects the luxury development’s two towers, providing a space for shared facilities and lifestyle amenities, says Fadi Jabri, CEO of Nikken Sekkei Dubai, the architecture firm behind the building.\n“Levitating in the air,” the giant glass corridor is an engineering marvel — but it’s not just for show, says Jabri.\nThe site is bisected by a six-lane highway, which meant building facilities at ground level was not possible, and “there was this need to rejoin those sites,” he explains. The property’s developers negotiated the use of the space below and above the road, allowing them to connect the two towers with a shopping mall beneath the road, and the Link above.\nTwenty-five meters (82 feet) high and wide, the cantilever contains three stories and is a key destination for the building’s hotel guests and residents, says Badr Benryane, director of food and beverage at the One&Only Za’abeel resort, which occupies the top 30 floors of one of the towers.\n“In the absence of a beach and other water-based activities, our guests will have The Link as their playground,” says Benryane.\nRelated article\nWorld’s highest 360-degree infinity pool opens in Dubai\n“It’s been inspired by the bustling streets of big cities around the world: it’s a futuristic boulevard, so as you walk down the middle of The Link, you will have different dining experiences.”\nThe Link’s eight restaurants include Tapasake, a poolside Nikkei restaurant serving up Japanese-Peruvian dishes. “On one end, there’s the restaurant with a terrace and indoor seating, and on the other is the pool club where we have amazing VIP cabanas, loungers and daybeds,” says Benryane.\nHaving taken a dip in the pool himself, Benryane says it’s one of the highlights of the space. “You’re basically in that infinity pool with nothing below you,” he says, adding: “You’re swimming amongst the clouds and overlooking the city — it’s beautiful.”\nTemperature regulated and featuring underwater speakers, the unique bathing spot is open to hotel guests and One Za’abeel residents, although tourists and Dubai residents can gain access with a pool day pass, starting from 1,000 dirhams ($272) per person, and going up to $10,000 for VIP cabanas that come equipped with their own sound system, air conditioning, showers, dining rooms and private garden.\nRelated article\nWorld’s deepest pool opens in Dubai, part of huge underwater city\nDubai is home to several record-setting pools: in 2021, the Aura Skypool became the world’s highest 360-degree infinity pool, and the world’s tallest infinity pool inside a building is the 293.9-meter-high (964.2 feet) pool on the 77th floor of the Address Beach Resort in Dubai’s Jumeirah Gate.\nThe Link’s 100-meter (328 feet) elevation and floor-to-ceiling windows provide 360-degree views across the city to the desert beyond, from which the building gets its name (“Za’abeel means the white sands of the region,” explains Badr).\nThe cantilever isn’t just important for the building’s social space, but also its design: the two towers were built leaning slightly out, so the weight of The Link would pull them both in, strengthening the overall structure, says Jabri.\nWeighing nearly 10,000 tons, it was constructed in eight parts and lifted into place with cranes over three days, which required the road below to be closed on several occasions. The $1 billion project was originally expected to open in late 2021, but was delayed by Covid.\n",

    "content": "There’s one small corner of the world that Michael Jordan cherishes more than any other — his own personal haven of sporting bliss.\nBut it’s not in Chicago. In fact, there isn’t a basketball court or hoop in sight.\nEven as he was staking his claim in the 1990s as the greatest player the NBA has ever seen, the Bulls icon was a regular guest on the golf course. These days, though, he hosts.\nThe Grove XXIII – a nod to his signature No. 23 jersey — is Jordan’s very own golf paradise, a private club tucked away on the outskirts of Hobe Sound, Florida. Ultra-exclusive, few have seen it, and even fewer have played it.\nFor Bobby Weed, it was at once the most straightforward and most difficult brief he had ever received: “Build me the best golf course. Build me the best driving range.”\nAnd there had been plenty of briefs before. A protégé, then close friend, of legendary course designer Pete Dye, the South Carolinian served as the PGA Tour’s chief architect before launching his own course design company in 1994.\nAlmost three decades on, Bobby Weed Golf Design has sculpted more than 20 courses from the ground up – from Stillwater, Minnesota, to Mito, Japan — and renovated many more, including Hobe Sound’s Medalist Golf Club in 2015.\nWith Tiger Woods headlining a member’s list that reads like a who’s who of the game’s elite, the Medalist is a private club that attracts a star-studded cohort of visitors. Among them was Jordan, a keen admirer of the revamp and who, in late 2017, was on the hunt for a course architect.\nA meeting later, Weed’s team was signed on to construct a golf kingdom fit for “His Airness.” As one of history’s most famous athletes, and with a net worth edging towards the $2 billion mark, according to Forbes, Jordan was a special category of client.\n“I knew that it would get a lot of attention because of MJ,” Weed, 68, told CNN.\n“I knew that there was some fanfare associated with it and I didn’t want to let him down.”\nThe land was secured soon after, some 200-plus acres of former citrus grove, next to Atlantic Ridge State Park. As he often does for projects, Weed lived on site, making the 265-mile switch across the state from Ponte Vedra Beach.\nWeed was all-in, and encouraged Jordan to be as engaged as he wanted to be in developments, inviting him to come out once weekly to track the progress. Jordan often visited multiple times a week.\nWeed likens his role as course architect to that of a quarterback: calling plays for a large roster of consultants. Watching Jordan in discussion with the team during one early meeting, he got the impression of a coach interacting with his players.\n“I think one of his qualities is he was such a good listener, and he absorbed everything that you were discussing,” Weed said.\n“He didn’t come out and say ‘do this or do that.’ He came out and observed and was a great listener, and he let me do my job.”\nWeed had his two pillars for a great golf course — an engaged owner and a good piece of property, though the latter would require some polishing.\nFor nearly 50 years, only Black men caddied The Masters. One day, they all but vanished\nTurning a flat, “featureless” site – bordered by two long drainage canals – into a cross between the manicured, parkland style of Augusta National and the rustic layout of Pine Valley represented the greatest challenge to him and his team.\nDirt was excavated from lagoons to build the course and its features, fixing the flatness issue and leaving behind six large lakes – the same number of NBA Championships Jordan won. It was a coincidence, but ultimately fit the theme of a course tuned to the finest degree to its owner’s style.\nJordan wanted firm and fast, a course that could both excite and challenge its members, many of whom would be among the PGA Tour’s current stars. A double-helix layout, with a “crossover” at the 5th and 14th holes, offers the flexibility to play continual internal circuits in three, six, or nine-hole loops – ideal for Jordan’s busy schedule.\nThe course didn’t just need to suit the playstyle of its owner, though, it needed to enhance it.\n“You don’t think I’m going to spend this much money and not have a little bit of an advantage do you?” Weed recalled Jordan saying.\nAdd to that the five-time MVP’s penchant for wagers, which will be familiar to viewers of docuseries “The Last Dance,” and the course has earned a new name among some members: “Slaughterhouse 23.”\n“It’s his golf course, so it’s set up very well for him,” former world No. 1 Rickie Fowler told the Subpar podcast in 2020.\nWeed, too, got drawn into the wagers, even during construction.\n“I can remember us being out there hitting shots and doing a little gambling while we were just playing in the dirt. It was just great fun and interaction,” he said.\n“It’s hard not to go out there and play a round with MJ without having a friendly wager.”\nTo meet the second requirement of Jordan’s brief, Weed’s team set aside 20 acres to construct a state-of-the-art practice facility that the designer believes has no equal.\nTwo 400-yard, double-sided driving lanes can be maintained for specific conditions, such as US Open or PGA Tour style fairways, with “target greens” in 25-yard increments. Each green has built-in pods that can track swathes of shot information, incorporating the PGA Tour’s ShotLink data.\nThe putting green is split into four quadrants, with incremental slopes ranging from 0-1% to 3-4% inclines. Even the grass on the tees is customizable, with different types to mimic warm or cool seasons.\n“It’s a Tour player’s haven to work on their game,” said Weed.\nCompared to Bobby Weed Golf Design, Nichols Architects had considerably less experience in golf courses, but it did have one key advantage in its efforts to beat other bids to build The Grove XXIII’s clubhouse.\nSpecializing in hospitality, residential, and commercial design, the firm had worked on the W South Beach in Miami — the favorite hotel of Jordan’s wife Yvette Prieto.\nThe team pulled no punches with its pitch to Jordan. “You’re not going to confuse this clubhouse with a clubhouse down the road or anything like that, and that’s what we’re selling you,” planning and design partner Igor Reyes told CNN of the pitching process, likening it to that depicted in the “Air” movie, where Nike must lure a rookie Jordan away from a deal with Adidas.\n“You’ve really got to make an architectural iconic shape, and a shape that you could almost immediately feel was swinging across the landscape. Hopefully you can almost read the concept without anybody having to tell you,” Reyes said.\nThe deal clincher — outlined to Jordan in a pitch video — was that clubhouse shape, inspired by the smooth, “almost machine-like” perfection of a golf swing.\nReyes said his team had heard of Jordan’s purported early struggles with his swing, and, in the video, set up a column grid to map the building’s structure onto Tiger Woods’ club trajectory. Jordan was captivated, and told the firm there and then that it would get the contract.\n“The first time you walk into the room with him, you don’t want to get too close or anything like that, it was kind of an odd thing,” Reyes said. “But by the second or third meeting we were just talking to him like a ‘regular’ client with a huge amount of respect.\n“There was a really a sense of, ‘This isn’t just a guy with a lot of money that wants to do something. This guy knows what he’s doing, he knows what he likes, and how to get to it.’”\nInside, 15,000 square feet of space leaves ample room for men’s and women’s lockers, indoor and outdoor lounge areas, kitchen and dining facilities, and even a shop. Hospitality was a priority, with a below-ground level meaning all service, as well as golf cart storage, can be managed from underneath.\nLike the course, Jordan’s identity was stamped all over. Columns were set further inside below an overhanging roof to mimic the hang-time that inspired the “Air Jordan” tag, while an elephant print used on some of his shoes was incorporated into the fritted-glass roof, casting the print across the floor when the sun shines through.\nCustomization goes all the way down to Air Jordan logos on the ice cubes, as PGA Tour pro Jimmy Walker shared to Instagram after a round at the course in March 2021.\nLike Weed, Reyes believes his job was made easier by an engaged client.\n“He was involved with a lot of the decisions … we didn’t change a color without him knowing,” Reyes said.\n“We have had work with other celebrity people and they won’t talk to you, it’s ‘I just want this’ and sort of like, ‘get out of the way.’ But he realized there was a lot of creativity going on and he wanted to be a part of it.”\nGiven Jordan’s regular on-site visits, there was no big reveal for the owner when the Grove XXIII officially opened in the fall of 2019, but there was a revelation when Weed joined him for his very first round.\nEcstatic Steph Curry sinks walk-off eagle to win celebrity golf tournament\nWhen play finished, the architect found himself wrapped in a 6-foot, 6-inch bear hug.\n“He looked at me and said, ‘I’m fortunate enough I can be anywhere in the world, but there’s no other place I’d rather be than right here,’” Weed recalled.\n“That’s like the ultimate compliment … to have his own golf course and to shape and mold that golf course for him and his friends, it’s just where he wants to be. It’s just a great spot and evolved into something fantastic.\n“He’s going to enjoy it as long as he’s playing and then it’s going to get passed along to the next generation — it’s just one of the great things about golf and why it has sustained itself over centuries.”\n",

    "content": "On Memorial Day, Americans rightly honor the more than 1 million warriors who've sacrificed their lives in the line of duty. We did the same on the recent 80th anniversary of the D-Day invasion by Allied troops in Normandy.\nBut our annual nod to past sacrifices means less and less if we're unwilling to honor what they fought for. American conflicts from the war for independence to World War II shared common traits—a desire on the part of Americans to fight, with a clear and limited purpose, and management of those conflicts by Americans or in close cooperation with American allies.\nDecades of mission creep have steered us away from those traits and into a dangerous place.\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was established after World War II as a strategic, defensive alliance to deter the Soviet Union's ambitions in Western Europe.\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO sought new purposes, evolving into an expeditionary force with interventions beyond its traditional area of operations, including the Balkans, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and now, indirectly, Ukraine. This shift has led to contentious debates about NATO's role and its impact on global stability, with some arguing that its expansion, especially toward Ukraine, has exacerbated tensions with Russia rather than ensuring peace.\nNATO's failure to evolve to meet the challenges of the current world has significant implications for American interests and global stability. CIA Director and once U.S. ambassador to Russia William Burns noted in 2008 that NATO's post-Cold War expansion would poke the Russian bear so to speak, stating, \"Ukrainian entry into NATO is the brightest of all redlines for the Russian elite (not just Putin) ... I have yet to find anyone who views Ukraine in NATO as anything other than a direct challenge to Russian interests.\"\nAnd NATO can't be solely blamed for Russia's aggression into Ukraine. The alliance's refusal to give Ukraine a hard \"no\" hasn't helped. Russia and Ukraine have sustained nearly 500,000 military casualties in the last two years, and there doesn't look to be an end in sight.\nThis cycle of engagement without clear objectives or successful outcomes has left deep scars, both on the affected regions and on America's credibility and resources.\nInvolvement in Ukraine risks escalating the conflict and drawing the alliance, specifically the U.S., deeper into a prolonged and deadly war. The financial and military aid the U.S. provides—we provided more to Ukraine in the last funding bill than the annual cost of the U.S. Marine Corps—strains American resources, and the presence of U.S. advisors increases the risk of American casualties.\nWe inch closer and closer to escalation with a nuclear power in a war that isn't even ours.\nAs a Green Beret who has led men into combat, I've seen the brutal costs of war firsthand. I've watched peers blown up in their prime, families destroyed, and futures lost to alcohol and suicide. These are not just numbers; they are lives shattered, and lives that can't even point to a foreign policy success the way the World War II generation could.\nTo combat veterans, the problem is clear. America's military conflicts today lack the traits that so often characterized our earlier campaigns. Today's wars are hive-mind affairs led by global coalitions. Their purpose is unclear, and often there is no discernable goal. Most Americans are either barely invested against these fights, or are confused about what to think about them.\nThere is a persistent refusal to engage with the world as it really is in favor of chasing idealistic hopes of democracy. This misguided pursuit often leads to disaster, leaving Americans to pay the cost.\nEurope reaps the benefits of America standing guard at their doorstep and continues asking for more. Former British Prime Minister David Cameron stated U.S. support for Ukraine is the \"keystone in the arch\" of the fight for democracy, while urging further assistance for Ukraine to not just \"hold the line\" but to \"go on the offensive\" in 2025. When former President Donald Trump asked everyone in the alliance to pay their fair share, the elites lost their collective minds, clutching their pearls at summits, terrified of losing the respect of European partners.\nNATO will celebrate its 75th anniversary this year, and no doubt there are many talking about what the next 75 years should look like. As a combat veteran with more than 20 years' experience, I can tell you—the future of NATO is America playing a realistic, fair part in the alliance. That part should not be characterized by a windfall of American taxpayer dollars, not to mention the potential cost in lives if war between Ukraine and Russia escalates into Western Europe.\nAmericans have stood with Europeans to storm the beaches and end tyranny before. But those moments were predicated on shared interests and mutual sacrifices.\nTo truly honor the military heroes of our past, we would do well to remember the clear-eyed purpose for which they fought. We need leaders who respect these American values and are committed to steering NATO back to its original mission of true defense and stability, rather than allowing it to drift into endless conflicts.\nJason Beardsley is director of veterans' initiatives at Stand Together and senior advisor to Concerned Veterans for America.

    "content": "I felt like I was on top of the world. I was married to my loving husband and together, we had an amazing 17-month-old son whom we both adored. My dream of having kids close in age was about to become a reality, and I was so excited to learn that I was pregnant with my second child.\nAfter my first healthy, stress-free pregnancy, I couldn't wait for my son to have a little sister or brother. My husband, Eli, jumped up and down with joy when we saw the pregnancy test was positive.\nIn the back of my head, I knew that miscarriage was a possibility, but I didn't believe it could happen to me.\nAnd then it did.\nWhen I was eight weeks pregnant, I had my first ultrasound. I was told that my baby had a strong heartbeat. I brought up that I had some light spotting, but the doctor told me not to worry.\n\"Don't worry,\" she said. \"That's normal. It happens.\"\nI breathed a sigh of relief, but I wasn't entirely convinced. My gut feeling turned out to be right.\nI lightly bled for two weeks straight. When the blood suddenly became darker and redder, I reached out to my doctor's office to make an appointment.\nI thought my concerns would be met with care and urgency from my medical team. Instead, I had almost entirely the opposite reaction from those whose help I desired most.\nInsensitive receptionists, limited doctor appointments, and entire days where none of the eight to 10 doctors in practice were in the office, were just a few of the unexpected and stressful challenges I dealt with. It all made my horrifying experience infinitely worse.\nI finally got a follow-up appointment, the morning my husband was leaving for a five-day work trip. He had attended every single doctor's appointment until then.\nI'll never forget the look of pity on the doctor's face as she told me the bad news. Despite having a beating heart, my baby was missing a brain, and I was likely going to miscarry. I would have to wait and see what my body decided to do with the defective fetus.\nEli's flight was delayed, so I was able to catch him before he departed. Eli couldn't even comprehend the news himself, as he was chaperoning his high school boys' softball team for a tournament and had absolutely nobody to speak to about his own sense of loss and the guilt of being away from his wife, who was suffering greatly.\nAs an Orthodox Jew, I faced another level of complication: my cramps worsened over the Sabbath when I couldn't use technology, including making phone calls.\nThere are exceptions if one's life is in danger, but while I was in a whole lot of pain I wasn't sure if it qualified as a life-threatening situation. I sought advice from my next-door neighbor, who threatened to call the doctor herself if I didn't.\nI'm really glad I opened up to someone with a more rational way thinking. It allowed me to remove the stress of wondering if there was anything else I should have been doing.\nWhen I woke up on the final day of my husband being away, I experienced the worst cramps yet. So when I saw a giant, fetus-sized clump of blood in the toilet, I froze completely and had no idea what to do.\nMy instinct was to cover it up as soon as possible. My hand shot out and I immediately flushed it. Not having Eli or someone else more rational than I at that moment was horrifying.\nOf course, this was also one of the days when no doctors were available because the office was moving. I sobbed to multiple receptionists for help, pleading for an ultrasound to see if my whole saga was over.\nBy a stroke of luck, my ultrasound technician happened to pass by one of the kinder receptionists and overheard that I was asking to see someone. She advocated for me and ordered me to come in right away. I am forever grateful to have had one medical angel who was concerned, and showed me the empathy I needed in that moment.\nWhen my husband came home, he was finally able to absorb all that happened and let out his emotions. We gave ourselves some time and grace to mourn the loss.\nI was ultimately able to get pregnant again. I gave birth to a healthy baby girl 10 months later, and one more daughter 5 years later.\nLooking back on my experience, I was surprised that the internet was lacking in relatable content about miscarriages. Other than a few articles and clinical websites, it had nothing that comforted me when I was up way too late in the middle of the night, searching for something, anything, that could tell me how I would survive losing my fetus, as well as so many of my hopes and dreams with it.\nI was under the false impression that people don't talk about miscarriages, since traditionally we don't talk about pregnancies until after the first trimester. I tried to be strong all by myself, but it became very clear I had no idea how to comprehend all of my emotions and physical pains.\nI didn't want any woman who had gone through a miscarriage to feel alone like I did. So I drew what I went through, creating a short comic about my story called, \"Miscarried.\" Actress, Mayim Bialik, also a mother, helped me launch the comic publicly and the feedback was incredible.\nI started getting emails from people all over the world who related to my story and were glad to find that they weren't in this alone. I ended up making a video out of my comic to reach more people. It's launching in May.\nAs awful as my experience was, I'm thankful that I was able to share it. While the world has certainly made some progress in discussing miscarriages and other complications regarding childbirth, there's still a long way to go.\nI hope that by telling my story through my comics, I can help others feel less alone in their struggle and help women understand that sometimes miscarriages, though terrible, can be a natural part of life, and that nothing is wrong with women who miscarry.\nIt's 2024. Nobody should be suffering alone. I want to make sure of that.\nChari Pere, creator of Miscarried: An Unspoken Cartoonmentary, worked as a creative director and illustrator/storyboard artist on projects for Red Bull, Jockey, Disney, Comedy Central, and Bud Light.

    "content": "Can an iron structure stand tall for 1,600 years without rusting, despite being exposed to the elements?\nIt seems implausible, considering the supposed lack of technology at the time of its construction.\nYet, inside New Delhi’s UNESCO-listed Qutb Minar complex – a collection of historic monuments and buildings built in the early 13th century in the city’s southern Mehrauli district – one mysterious structure stands as a testament to this very enigma.\nVisitors to the courtyard of the complex’s Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque will immediately spot an imposing 7.2-meter, six-ton iron pillar with a decorative top that’s even older than the complex.\nRemarkably, the pillar is now as pristine as the day it was forged, defying both age and environmental adversities, including the Indian capital’s intense temperatures and increasing pollution. Dating back to the 5th century, its remarkable resilience continues to captivate travelers today.\nTypically, iron and iron alloy structures exposed to the air or moisture oxidize over time, rendering them coated in rust unless they are protected, like the Eiffel Tower, by layers of special paint. Scientists both in India and abroad began studying the iron pillar in Delhi in 1912 to try to figure out why it hadn’t corroded.\nIt wasn’t until 2003 that experts at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in the northern city of Kanpur cracked the mystery, revealing the answer in the journal Current Science.\nThey found that the pillar, primarily made of wrought iron, has a high phosphorus content (about 1%), and lacks sulfur and magnesium, unlike modern iron. Additionally, ancient craftsmen used a technique called “forge-welding.”\nThat means they heated and hammered the iron, keeping the high phosphorus content intact, a method uncommon in modern practices.\nArcheo-metallurgist R. Balasubramaniam, who authored the report, said that this unconventional approach contributed to the pillar’s enduring strength.\nRelated article\nIndia is a hiker’s dream destination. Here are a dozen of its most epic trails\nA thin layer of “misawite,” a compound of iron, oxygen and hydrogen, was also found on the pillar’s surface, he said. This layer is formed catalytically by the presence of high phosphorus in the iron and the absence of lime, thus further enhancing the pillar’s durability.\nBalasubramaniam lauded the metallurgists for their ingenuity, describing the pillar as “a living testament to India’s ancient metallurgical prowess.”\nIts durability is evidenced by historical accounts, including an incident in the 18th century when a cannonball fired at the pillar reportedly failed to break it, showcasing the impressive strength of this ancient monument.\nToday, the pillar serves as the emblem of scientific organizations like the National Metallurgical Laboratory and the Indian Institute of Metals.\nBeyond its metallurgical intrigue, the origin of the Iron Pillar is also veiled in mystery. One widely circulated account traces it back to the Gupta Empire, particularly under the reign of Chandragupta II, also known as Vikramaditya, around the 4th and 5th centuries.\nAccording to this tale, the pillar was erected in the Varah Temple of Udayagiri Caves, near Vidisha in Madhya Pradesh, as a victory monument dedicated to the Hindu deity Lord Vishnu. It’s said to have once borne a statue of Garuda, the mythical eagle mount of Vishnu, on its top, though this figure has been lost to history.\nAnother theory, proposed by heritage activist and educator Vikramjit Singh Rooprai, suggests it may have been bought by Varāhamihira, a renowned astronomer in the court of King Vikramaditya.\n“One of his books, the ‘Surya Siddhanta,’ details methods for calculating celestial positions, eclipses, and other astronomical phenomena - and it is believed that he used a tall pillar in his calculations,” says Vikramjit.\n“Therefore, upon his migration from Vidisha to Mihirapuri (now Mehrauli), where he founded an observatory, there exists a likelihood that he brought the pillar with him for continued use in his studies and calculations.”\nRelated article\nDevil’s dung or dinner delight? The story behind hing, one of India’s most divisive ingredients\nAdditionally, some historical records credit notable figures like Raja Anangpal of the Tomar dynasty, and Muslim rulers such as Iltutmish and Qutbuddin Aibek, for the relocation of the pillar to the Qutb complex.\nIt’s also been mentioned in the arts. In the epic poem “Prithviraj Raso,” penned by Chand Bardai, a courtier in the Chahamana dynasty under King Prithviraj Chauhan, the Iron Pillar holds great significance.\n“Bardai describes the Iron Pillar in Raso as a nail holding the Earth on the hoof of Sheshnag, the serpent king in Hindu mythology,” says Vikramjit.\n“Raso recounts how Raja Anangpal tried to uproot this nail despite warnings from Brahmins of dire consequences. When it was pulled out, revealing a red base believed to be Sheshnag’s blood, panic ensued, fearing Earth’s destruction. Anangpal quickly ordered its reinstallation, but it was not properly secured, resulting in it becoming loose. Thus, Bardai suggests that this incident inspired the colloquial name ‘Dilli’ for Delhi, which is a pun on the word ‘dhilli’, meaning ‘loose’ in Hindi.”\nAccording to one legend, if you stand with your back against the pillar and wrap your arms around it, making sure your fingers touch each other, your wish will come true – a tradition that imbues the pillar with spiritual significance beyond its historical value.\nHowever, the ASI (Archeological Survey of India) has put a fence around the pillar to minimize human impact.\nConservation architect and heritage expert, Pragya Nagar, finds the pillar’s preservation remarkable within the complex, despite the demolition and reconstruction of its surroundings over the years.\n“If we do look at the technique that was used to create the pillar from a fresh perspective, beyond mere acknowledgment of its ancient origins, we may discover avenues to leverage similar methods for the development of sustainable material alternatives, considering the environmental harm associated with processes like metal extraction,” she tells CNN.\n“It is imperative to look at history beyond relics and monuments that simply need to be conserved and marveled at, but as repositories of traditional knowledge and indigenous practices. This holistic approach has the potential to pave the way towards a more sustainable future.”\n",

    "content": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.\nA couple of weeks ago, I rewatched Jurassic Park for probably the 10th time since the movie came out 30 years ago. (As an aside, it really holds up — 10/10, no notes.)\nEarly in the plot, when the guests are discussing their impressions of the park, Jeff Goldblum’s character (also 10/10, just perfect) launches into a speech so prescient you could sub out all the dinosaur stuff and map it onto the modern debate around artificial intelligence.\n“Don’t you see the danger, John, inherent in what you’re doing here? Genetic power is the most awesome force the planet’s ever seen, but you wield it like a kid that’s found his dad’s gun … You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could, and before you even knew what you had, you patented it, and packaged it, and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox, and now you’re selling it.”\nAnd then comes the line that later launched a thousand memes: “Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn’t stop to think if they should.”\nNaturally, the skeptic of the group is dismissed as a Luddite and the movie carries on. (Spoiler alert: The Luddite was right!)\nAI skeptics — who are legion, and not necessarily part of the fringe tin foil hat crowd — are begging Silicon Valley to take a beat before unleashing AI to the world.\nBut tech companies, faced with the most powerful computing innovation in a generation, are running around like kids who just found their dad’s gun.\nSee here: Apple and Google — which, to be sure, deserve a lot of credit for the innovations they’ve brought to the world — have recently latched on to AI-powered features to help sell their newest tablets and smartphones. After all, throwing AI into your pitch deck is a surefire way to signal to shareholders that you’re on the cutting edge, which helps distract from the fact that your company hasn’t actually produced any significant proprietary tech in years.\nIn marketing those new devices, though, Apple and Google have lost the plot.\nApple’s new iPad advertisement made headlines for all the wrong reasons this week. The spot depicts a massive industrial hydraulic press slowly crushing a collection of objects that represent the human creative experience: There’s a piano, a record player blasting Sonny & Cher’s 1972 hit “All I Ever Need Is You,” cans of paint, books, a Space Invaders arcade console, a trumpet. The music bounces along as the machine switches on and smashes it all down. Then, the big reveal: It’s all contained in Apple’s new iPad, its thinnest and most powerful ever, thanks to its brand new AI chip.\nThe outrage online came fast and furious.\n“It is the most honest metaphor for what tech companies do to … artists, musicians, creators, writers, filmmakers: squeeze them, use them, not pay well, take everything then say it’s all created by them,” filmmaker Asif Kapadia wrote on X.\n“If you thought THIS IPad ad was weird, you should have seen the first cut where they lined up all your favorite characters and shot them,” quipped actor and producer Luke Barnett.\nApple issued a rare apology for the ad on Thursday, telling AdAge that “our goal is to always celebrate the myriad of ways users express themselves and bring their ideas to life through iPad. We missed the mark with this video, and we’re sorry.”\nEarlier in the week, CEO Tim Cook said Apple’s “outrageously powerful” M4 chip will power the company’s new AI tools. In other words: Check it out, Wall Street! People aren’t buying our stuff as much any more but just wait until we add bots!\nMeanwhile, is anyone else getting inundated with Google’s Pixel ads, which show people giddily using the smartphone’s AI photo-editing software to deceive their online followers?\nIn those ads, a guy who can’t dunk a basketball on his own uses a trampoline to get to the rim, and then edits out the trampoline. An imperfect group selfie gets everyone’s best angle and creates a composite image of a moment that never happened. A dad tosses his kid up playfully in the air, and then edits the image to seem, for reasons I still don’t understand, as if the kid went several inches higher into the air.\nThis is Google going, “look what we can do!” without any reflection on how pointless it all is. It is, at best, distortion for distortion’s sake. At worst, it’s distortion for the sake of conditioning regular people to be cool with the idea of visual misinformation.\nSmartphones and tablets were invented to enhance our lived experience, to make it easier to leave the house and go to the beach and meet up with friends — just a good camera-computer combo that fits in your pocket.\nTheoretically, our phones and tablets will become even more useful with AI, serving as virtual assistants that can do all the boring stuff we don’t want to, like summarizing all your new emails and filtering out junk. There’s a world in the not too distant future, according to AI proponents, where you can simply tell Siri or Google “order my usual breakfast from the coffee shop near the office, I’ll be there in 10 minutes to pick it up,” and the bot will do just that.\nWe’re not there yet, however. And so far, the consumer applications for AI are simultaneously underwhelming and dystopian.\nDistorted images may be harmless social media fodder, until they become propaganda spread by bad actors.\nApple is expected to announce its own ChatGPT-like tools that could be a game changer for your internet searches. But generative AI bots are also prone to give wrong answers and experience hallucinations, and no one seems to know what happens when the bots run out of human-generated data to learn from and start hoovering up their own artificial texts like a snake eating its own tail.\nThe Jeff Goldblums of the AI debate — who include some of the industry’s own pioneers — are not necessarily saying we have to smother AI and pretend it never existed. Most of them are just your friendly neighborhood skeptic, walking around going, “hey, should we really do that?”\nClearly, we weren’t invited to Apple’s or Google’s marketing meetings.\n",

    "content": "Move over Met Gala. On Saturday, stars gathered on the steps of The Music Center in Los Angeles for the Gold Gala — a celebration of Asian Pacific influential talent across entertainment, fashion, technology and more, hosted by the non-profit Gold House.\nAnd they were dressed to represent — many proudly embracing Asian designers and cultural heritage through their red carpet looks.\nActor Karrueche Tran stunned in a striking red ao dai with a sheer overlay and headpiece by Vietnamese American fashion designer Thai Nguyen. “I knew I had to represent my culture, half of who I am, in a major way,” she wrote on Instagram. Tran has a Vietnamese mother and African American father.\nTaiwanese drag queen Nymphia Wind, who recently won “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” told CNN that her ensemble by Singaporean designer Sheng Cheong — a dress and cape featuring a bold print of neon yellow and white “laser cut clouds” — was intended to “reimagine what club kids would look like in the Forbidden City.”\nElsewhere, Bollywood filmmaker Karan Johar wore an ornately embroidered suit jacket by Rimple and Harpeet — an Indian fashion brand that specializes in handcrafted pieces inspired by ancient crafts and vintage textiles — and Indonesian singer Agnez Mo accessorized with golden hair pins and an elegant hand fan.\n“Anything goes here and that’s what is so celebratory,” TV personality Jeannie Mai told CNN of the event, which is sometimes described as the “Asian Pacific Met Gala.” “It’s the one place where you can really represent and be invited to do so.”\nThe glitzy affair honors the Gold House’s annual A100 list — one hundred Asian Pacific leaders who have made a significant impact on culture and society. Author and TV host Padma Lakshmi, actor Lucy Liu and the cast and creator of Netflix’s Emmy-award winning series “Beef” were among honorees.\nFor actor and comedian Joel Kim Booster, the significance of a gala feting so many people in the AAPI community, was not lost.\n“Events like this are so exciting to me because when I was coming up, I think there was a lot of energy like, there’s only going to be one of us in the room,” he said.\n“It’s so rewarding to be in a space like this where we’re all coming together and supporting each other. It’s not something that I grew up imagining I’d have for myself.”\nThere have been barriers across industries; in Hollywood, Asians have historically been underrepresented or stereotyped. But that has changed in recent years.\nA joint study by Gold House and the USC Annenberg found the percentage of speaking Asian characters in top box-office films in the US rose from 3.4% in 2007 to 15.9% in 2022. The roles themselves are more complex.\nThe age of streaming has also ushered in more opportunities for diverse and daring storytelling — on and off screen.\nFX’s Shogun, for example, became an instant hit when it premiered in February. Not only does it feature a predominantly Asian cast who speak mostly in Japanese — behind the scenes, Japanese experts in everything from samurai dramas to a “master of gesture,” were brought in to ensure authenticity.\n“I think what the industry has realized is that Asian creativity and Asian talent is a) different and b) lucrative. So that’s been wonderful to see people take chances, and how we’ve knocked it out of the park,” Lakshmi told CNN.\nMany acknowledge there’s more work to be done all around.\n“It’s an exciting time to see the Asian diaspora coming together to really tell our own stories, in our time, in our space,” said fashion designer and the gala’s creative director Prabal Gurung.\n“It’s great to see that visibility. There’s a long way to go still, obviously we feel that way. But progress is being made.”\n",

    "content": "Questions regarding Melania Trump's whereabouts have flooded social media, after the former first lady was not seen at court for the entirety of her husband Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial.\nAs the defense issued closing arguments at New York City's Manhattan Criminal Courthouse on Tuesday, three of the former president's five children were present and seated in the front row: Donald Jr., Eric and Tiffany Trump. However, as with the rest of the weeks-long trial, Melania Trump was nowhere to be seen.\nFormer The Apprentice star Donald Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in relation to so-called hush money he arranged for his then-lawyer, Michael Cohen, to pay Daniels to keep the alleged affair she had with the former president a secret ahead of the 2016 election.\nThe money was listed in Donald Trump's company records as \"legal fees,\" which prosecutors suggest was part of an unlawful attempt to influence the outcome of the 2016 race. Donald Trump admitted to reimbursing the $130,000 to Cohen, but has denied all accusations of wrongdoing, saying that the trial is part of a political witch hunt aimed at derailing his bid for another term in the White House.\nAs the trial rolled to its conclusion on Tuesday, video footage was shared of Donald Trump's family members standing outside the courthouse ahead of the day's proceedings. And while it was noted that he had three of his children on hand to join his team of supporters, questions were raised about Melania Trump.\nFormer NBC senior executive Mike Sington took to X, formerly Twitter, to share footage of Donald Trump being questioned as he entered the courthouse. As of press time, the video has garnered more than 400,000 views. Newsweek has contacted a representative of Donald Trump via email for comment.\nCaptioning the footage, Sington wrote: \"As Tiffany Trump, Eric Trump, Lara Trump and Don Jr stand behind Donald Trump at the courthouse today, reporter shouts the obvious question: 'Where's Melania?'\"\nAhead of closing arguments, One America News Network's Daniel Baldwin cited sources as informing him that \"Don Trump, Jr., Eric Trump, Lara Trump, Tiffany Trump, Michael Boulos, Steve Witkoff, Will Scharf, and Deroy Murdock will be at court today with President Trump.\"\n\"But where's Melania?\" an X user responded, echoing a flood of similarly worded messages that dominated the conversation on the micro-blogging platform.\nRon Filipkowski, a former federal prosecutor and frequent critic of Donald Trump, also joined in on the action, writing: \"Where's Melania?\"\nThe former first lady's absence from the trial spared her from listening to adult entertainer Daniels' testimony, during which she shared details of her alleged sexual encounter with Donald Trump. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, alleged that the encounter took place in 2006, one year after Melania Trump married the then real estate mogul.\nWhile she has been absent from the courtroom, Melania Trump has been photographed with her husband on occasion in recent months. The former model and her husband were on hand for their 18-year-old son Barron's high school graduation in Palm Beach, Florida, on May 17.\nOver the past several months, Melania Trump has largely shied away from making public appearances, a move that prompted questions as her husband ramped up his efforts to secure the Republican presidential nomination.\nMelania Trump's former friend and aide Stephanie Winston Wolkoff told CNN earlier in May that she did not believe the Slovenia native would attend the trial.\n\"Melania is Melania's own person,\" said Winston Wolkoff, who has been highly critical of Melania Trump in the years since their relationship soured. \"In regards, again, to a marriage that you want to consider to be something that most people are trying to still understand, don't. I do not see her supporting him this way.\"\n\"I think you can feel that humiliation without having to put yourself in front of the cameras,\" she added. \"Everything Melania does is staged.\"\nDonald Trump's eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, has also been notably absent from the courthouse during the trial, and has not publicly weighed in on the matter.\nHowever, a source familiar with the situation told Newsweek in April that Ivanka Trump—who served as a senior adviser to her father along with her husband, Jared Kushner, during his term in office—has been communicating with Donald Trump and \"remains as supportive as ever.\"\n",

Though things have gotten a lot better since then, it's hard to forget the weight of what I went through during my middle school years. From severe bullying to isolation to chronic stress, my mental health journey has been a painful rollercoaster.\nStarting in elementary school, I was constantly the new kid, ostracized and put down by many of my peers. Fifth grade through middle school was the worst bullying I've ever experienced. In my small grade of 20, girls used me for homework answers, put me down, spread rumors, and yelled at me almost daily.\nIn 6th grade, some girls found my email and sent ruthless messages like \"You deserve nothing in life\" and \"No one will ever love you.\" After hearing that message multiple times, I started to believe it was true. I struggled with low self-esteem and faced constant depressive episodes.\nAs I entered high school, I constantly found myself dealing with high levels of stress. Soon, chronic stress infiltrated every part of my life, often to the point that I had to stay home because it made me physically ill.\nStress affected me both mentally and physically. I felt weaker than ever and was perpetually exhausted from lack of sleep, my mind constantly racing and overwhelmed by my workload, further fueled by my imposter syndrome. It felt like I was running a race with no finish line.\nPerhaps the saddest part was going through all these problems alone. While it's somewhat comforting to know other teenagers face similar issues, it's also sickening that our cries for help often go unnoticed.\nThe CDC reported that feelings of persistent sadness or hopelessness among teenagers grew by 40 percent from 2009 to 2019. Back in 6th grade, I had no one to turn to. But now, I'm becoming the person I needed.\nAllow me to introduce myself—I'm Anaiah Singh, the high school freshman behind an app revolutionizing how teens navigate mental health challenges.\nI've spent the last three months building HeartTalk, a peer-to-peer support app that offers teens a lifeline with supportive voice messages, allowing them to listen to and record audio messages of support for each other worldwide. It's like having a friend's comforting voice in your pocket during tough times. And I'm not stopping there—my mission is to encourage others to join the movement by recording their messages, creating a ripple of support worldwide.\nThe Instagram account promoting my app has reached over 30 million people worldwide, and the beta version of my app attracted over 3,000 users within just a couple of weeks.\nMore important than the numbers though, are the personal stories young people are sharing with me. One user, a 15-year-old girl, reached out to me to say: \"It's so helpful... I'm so glad something like that exists. Got me crying for good, and honestly, it did make my day better. I'd share it with all my friends and family.\"\nStories like these are why I decided to build my app—to help millions of other teens never suffer alone.\nEveryone wants to help someone, and I'm on a mission to find these people and connect them with the teens who need them most. Building this app is not just for the millions of teenagers in need of support. It's also to show 6th-grade me that someone out there wants to help her.\nAnaiah Singh is a 15-year-old student based in the Bay Area. She is dedicated to improving teen mental health through technology. With her app, HeartTalk, Anaiah aims to provide a supportive platform for teenagers facing mental health challenges.\nAll views expressed are the author's own.\nDo you have a unique experience or personal story to share?

According to DW News, it is the third time that Pistorius has visited Ukraine since the start of Russia's invasion in February 2022.\n\"We will continue to support you in this defensive campaign,\" Pistorius said during his meeting with Umerov.\nThe package included fresh ammunition for the IRIS-T air defense system, which is capable of reaching short to medium ranges. DW News reported that the systems can intercept missiles up to 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) in altitude and 40 kilometers (24.8 miles) in distance.\nNewsweek reached out to Ukraine's Defense Ministry via email for additional comment Thursday.\nPistorius announced over X, formerly Twitter, last week that Germany had provided another IRIS-T SLM and IRIS-T SLS \"combined fire unit\" to Kyiv's military. NATO allies have worked to bolster Ukraine's air defense capabilities in recent months amid an increase in Russian air strikes.\nSweden also pledged a military aid package worth more that $1.25 billion to Ukraine on Thursday, the largest that the country has provided to Kyiv to date. The package will include airborne surveillance and control aircraft, artillery and Sweden's \"entire stock\" of tracked armored personnel carriers.\nStockholm said on Thursday that the package will bring Ukraine's air defenses to a \"completely new capability.\"\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez signed a bilateral security agreement with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier this week that allocates $1.1 billion of Madrid's military aid to Kyiv in 2024. That package includes anti-aircraft missiles, Leopard tanks and ammunition, according to a report from the Associated Press.\nUkraine is also set to receive a large package from the United Kingdom in the coming weeks, which will include naval boats and weapons, air defense missiles, precision-guided missiles and combat vehicles. The package, announced by U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in late April, is worth $618 million, and brings the British aid total for the financial year to $3.71 billion.\nAfter months of debate and delay, the United States' supplemental aid to Ukraine is set to begin reaching Ukraine's frontlines, although Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to Zelensky, told Bloomberg in an interview published Wednesday that the weaponry was taking \"weeks\" to reach where it is needed most along the line of contact.\nThe Institute for the Study of War (ISW) warned in its assessment of the Russia-Ukraine war on Wednesday that Russia was likely looking to take \"advantageous\" amid the delays in U.S.-provided aid to Kyiv.\n",

    "content": "Red Bull's Managing Director Oliver Mintzlaff has issued a stark warning to Mercedes' CEO Toto Wolff regarding his public overtures towards star driver Max Verstappen. The rebuke follows Wolff's comments admiring Verstappen amidst Mercedes' pursuit of replacing seven-time F1 champion Lewis Hamilton who is set to join Ferrari in 2025.\nMintzlaff, responding to Wolff's comments, firmly reestablished Verstappen's commitment to Red Bull. He articulated the importance of the Mercedes chief focusing on internal team challenges rather than eyeing talents contracted with rival teams.\n\"This is a decision that Max needs to take, but there is no team up and down the grid that wouldn't do handstands to have him in the car,\" Wolff had previously stated as quoted by ESPN, acknowledging the allure Verstappen holds across the Formula 1 grid. He added, touching on the difficulties that the team has faced with the ground-effect cars, \"I'd love to have him, but first we need to sort out our car. First, we owe it to George [Russell] and Lewis [Hamilton] to improve the car and give them equipment that is good before dreaming about the future next year.\"\nCountering this, Mintzlaff was explicit in his disapproval of Wolff's public courtship of Verstappen. \"I understand the pressure that Toto Wolff and perhaps other teams have after years of being behind, but I think Toto should concentrate on his challenges. He has enough of those,\" Mintzlaff expressed in an interview with Bild Am Sonntag, as quoted by Pit Pass. He underscored the disrespect perceived in discussing another team's key assets, stating, \"It also has something to do with respect. If I keep talking about the personnel of other teams, that's not right.\"\nMintzlaff also highlighted that Verstappen has not shown any desire to abandon his current team, reinforcing the strong relationship and trust built between him and Red Bull's leadership, including Christian Horner and Helmut Marko.\n\"Max still has a long-term contract here and hasn't said a word that he doesn't want to fulfil it,\" he said. \"I'm not at all worried that he's considering a move. Things just have to calm down again now. That's what Max wants, and that's what we want too.\n\"At least I can't think of any. Max wants the fastest car... we have this. Max wants to become world champion... with us, he has the best chances.\n\"Max is a loyal guy,\" he added. \"He knows that Christian Horner and Helmut Marko have always placed their trust in him. He appreciates that. In addition, Red Bull is simply a great brand that he can extremely identify with. So there are many reasons for staying, and none against.\"\nAdditionally, Mintzlaff addressed the shocking exit of Chief Technical Officer Adrian Newey, who will be leaving the team in 2025. He commented:\n\"Adrian has done great things here over the years and played a big part in us winning 13 world championship titles.\n\"It's obviously a shame that he's leaving us, but we discussed it in a very fair and respectful dialogue. What he leaves behind is not only a unique legacy but also a structure that he helped to build.\n\"Of course, we will miss him, also as a person, but tomorrow we will still know how to build a very fast Formula 1 car.\"\n",

    "content": "Many consequences of cyber breaches have been well-documented, including financial and reputational damage. Recent developments, however, show that another serious consequence stands to become top of mind for business leaders: legal action against both the management and members of the boards of directors of organizations that suffer cyber breaches.\nAccording to cybersecurity expert Joseph Steinberg, the SEC's recent charges against the chief information security officer (CISO) of SolarWinds, combined with its new cybersecurity disclosure rules, should leave no doubt in anyone's mind that the government is demanding companies to \"get their cybersecurity houses in order.\"\n\"In a worst-case scenario, a cyber breach could lead to criminal charges against people,\" Steinberg says. \"We are talking about not only financial penalties, but, under some circumstances, potential prison time.\"\nThe SEC's filing against the SolarWinds CISO is not the first instance in the United States of criminal charges being leveled against a cybersecurity professional. Steinberg points to the case of former Uber chief security officer (CSO) Joseph Sullivan, who, until his sentencing, faced potential prison time for his role in the attempted covering up of a 2016 data breach that exposed personal information for more than 50 million customers of the ride-hailing platform. According to an article in SC Media, the former Uber CSO was ultimately punished with a probation sentence, a fine and a requirement to perform community service \"tied to a cover-up of Uber's 2016 breach.\"\nHowever, the SEC's new disclosure rules and its charges against the SolarWinds CISO have potentially changed the equation for companies when it comes to cyber breaches, Steinberg explains. The federal government is taking cyber breaches seriously, and company leaders should heed the recent news as a warning.\n\"Essentially, the onus has shifted as to who is responsible,\" Steinberg says. \"Instead of viewing cyber incidents as something that happened to a company, as something that doesn't necessarily need to be explicitly explained in filings or revealed to the public, the new rules basically say that if an incident occurs, the company's management and board are responsible to ensure that they adequately explain to the world what happened.\"\nSteinberg stresses that being upfront with investors about material cyber risks is paramount. In short, investors need to know what a company is doing to address cyber threats, how it has historically handled any cyber incidents, what damages have occurred due to any past cyber incidents and what damages are at risk of happening due to potential future cyber incidents.\n\"Someone's decision to invest in a company can be dramatically impacted by information about cyber risks,\" Steinberg says, adding that by not being upfront about cyber risks and incidents, companies could be misleading the public — which can reasonably be considered akin to \"falsifying a financial statement.\"\nPer analysis by Thomson Reuters, it's \"not explicitly mandated\" in the SEC's new rules, but \"firms are expected to provide details on board proficiency in cybersecurity.\" The directive from the SEC makes it clear that public corporations have \"to describe the board of directors' oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats and management's role and expertise in assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats.\"\nTo comply with the SEC's new rules around cybersecurity, companies need board members with the right type of cybersecurity experience and skills, Steinberg says.\n\"Companies need people on their boards who can oversee the management of cyber risk, not people who are technically savvy but do not understand how to ensure that the business is properly managing cyber risk,\" he says. \"The board must oversee the management of cyber risk rather than seeking to perform or actively manage the job of the CISO.\"\nUnfortunately, many companies do not have board members with adequate, appropriate cyber expertise. Findings from 2023 research conducted by WSJ Pro revealed that the \"number of directors at S&P 500 companies who have cybersecurity experience has increased sharply since\" 2022; however, the \"amount of cybersecurity expertise on boards remains relatively low, at a time when boards are under increased scrutiny for security failings.\" Specifically, the research found that as of August 31, 2023, \"107 directors at 113 companies had professional experience in cybersecurity.\"\nBut Steinberg cautions against boards rushing the process of signing on people with cybersecurity expertise.\n\"One of the problems that many boards face is that they bring on people who aren't necessarily skilled at overseeing cybersecurity,\" Steinberg says. \"Just because someone is an excellent baseball player does not mean that he will make an excellent team manager, and just because someone is an excellent manager does not mean that he will make an excellent team CEO. The same is true when it comes to managing and overseeing cyber risk. Boards need the right combination of experience, skills and talent to properly handle cyber risk, as opposed to merely thinking they are handling it well.\"\nTo that end, Steinberg emphasizes that it is vital for companies to empower the right people to play the right roles when it comes to cybersecurity. Specifically, CISOs, CSOs and other cyber experts should manage cybersecurity and should ensure that the necessary parties perform what is needed in order to handle day-to-day tasks and to develop and implement broader strategies. Board members should oversee the party managing cybersecurity to make sure that the cybersecurity program provides the company with adequate protection (as agreed upon by the board) against cyber risk.\n\"One of the issues that I see develop on a regular basis is board members getting overly involved in what they think is the oversight of cyber risk—but is actually the management or performance of it,\" Steinberg says. \"In turn, they end up wasting time and energy discussing matters that should be left to the CISO.\"\nHe notes that when board members attempt to take cybersecurity fully under their control, it takes away their focus from other elements of the business—and can make a company more exposed than if the management of cyber risk was properly overseen by the right experts.\n\"Board members who do not understand their appropriate role in dealing with cybersecurity and cyber risk can end up interfering with the CISO or CSO's ability to do their job,\" Steinberg says. \"Additionally, the failure of board members to understand where they fall into a company's cybersecurity and cyber risk management efforts can cause the board as a whole to become distracted—and in turn, fail to address pressing matters across the business.\"\nUltimately, he says, those organizations that do not yet have cybersecurity expertise present on their boards should take action now.\n\"In the same way that you wouldn't have a board that lacks accounting and legal expertise, you shouldn't have a board without cybersecurity expertise,\" Steinberg says. \"For many companies, a cyber incident is more likely to pose serious danger than accounting or legal issues.\"\nIdeally, he says, companies should appoint people who are \"familiar with the management of information security and cybersecurity.\"\n\"To not have that level of expertise is like presenting financial documents to board members with little to no accounting knowledge,\" Steinberg says.\n",

    "content": "A work contract signed by Diana Spencer two years before she married the then-Prince of Wales is expected to fetch thousands of dollars at auction.\nThe document was filled out in black ink by the young woman who would go on to become world famous as Princess Diana.\nThe written agreement with Solve Your Problem Ltd., an employment agency hiring nannies for the rich and famous, was completed by Diana in May 1979 – though it is not 100% truthful. Then just 17 years old, she lists her date of birth as July 1, 1960, exactly a year before she was actually born.\nAccording to a press release sent to CNN by English auction house Auctioneum, Solve Your Problem Ltd. was a recruitment firm set up by Mary Cook, a one-time Portuguese countess who had settled in London after divorcing her husband.\nThe firm was “a high-class establishment, vetting staff for royal residences and for homes of the rich and famous based in London,” according to the auctioneer. Cook kept the contract as a souvenir and it was eventually passed to the company’s current owners, who are now offering it for sale.\n• Sign up to CNN’s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on the royal family, what they are up to in public and what’s happening behind palace walls.\nOf Diana’s altered date of birth, auctioneer Andrew Stowe said in the press release: “Our client had always been told that this was done deliberately, in order that Diana would appear older and therefore more likely to secure a job with the agency, or at least a higher rate of pay! It could, of course, just be a simple oversight!”\nThe young woman listed her religion on the contract as “Protestant” and said that she couldn’t drive. She did not say what kind of work she was looking for or how much she expected to get paid, but that she was seeking employment “as soon as possible.”\nDiana, who died in a car crash in Paris in 1997, had moved to London not long before signing the contract, according to Auctioneum. It shows her address as Cadogan Place SW1 – a few months later she would move to her own flat at Coleherne Court in Kensington.\nThe document, which is expected to sell for up to $10,000, is thought to be the late princess’ first official work contract. She had done some informal childcare work for friends and family previously – two of whom are listed as referees on the document.\n“This is an incredibly important piece of history,” said Stowe. “Getting your first job is a big moment in anyone’s life, let alone when that person becomes one of the most famous figures of the twentieth century. Here we have a teenage Diana Spencer, freshly moved to London, trying to find her way in life and applying for her first job. It’s so human, so real, so normal.”\nRelated article\nThis very ’80s evening gown worn by Princess Diana just set an auction record\nThe contract is annotated in blue by the employer, who describes some of the applicant’s skills as “cook – basic … housework … animals … ballet dancer.” Other comments include “check skirt” and “lovely girl – send anywhere.”\nStowe described the document as “poignant,” adding: “At face value, this is just an everyday document, a piece of office stationery that lived in a filing cabinet alongside hundreds of others. Yet just over two years later, Diana Spencer would become Princess Of Wales and her life would never be the same. This contract is one of the last remaining snapshots of Diana’s life before she was thrust into the spotlight.\n“It’s filled with hope, it’s filled with nerves, it represents the emotions and feelings of every teenager trying to find their first job – and yet, there is of course, a great feeling of sadness attached.”\nThe item is being sold as part of Auctioneum’s Autographs & Memorabilia Online Auction, which ends on Tuesday.\n",

    "content": "From the blooming azaleas of Augusta National to the breathtaking lighthouse at Turnberry in Scotland, golf is renowned for its natural beauty. The same cannot be said, however, for the sport’s primary mode of transport.\nBut one Danish company is on a mission to put the art in golf cart.\nCopenhagen-based Garia is the self-described “world’s first and only” luxury golf and leisure car brand (that’s car, not cart), whose aims to regenerate the traditional golf buggy have led to ambitions that lie far beyond the confines of the 18-hole course.\nSuch goals seemed a long drive away in 2005 when Anders Lynge, still in design school, met Soren Bak Hansen during an internship at a car company. A short while later, having spotted a gap in the market, the duo founded Garia.\n“When it came to the golf cart 18 years ago, they all looked the same – there weren’t any serious high-end products out there,” Lynge told CNN.\n“If you lived in a high-end community – paying hundreds of thousands of dollars of membership fees, a $10 million house, whatever you had – the whole lifestyle of these people, from their cars to their clothes, watches; everything was super personalized.\n“We thought it was strange that they all had the same type of golf cart … So the idea behind Garia was basically to say, ‘How can we make a product that fulfils the lifestyle of these people, that has the same sort of quality that they’re used to from every other product they surround themselves with?’\n“That really changed our focus to say, ‘Hey, let’s do that: the ultimate golf car.’”\nAchieving that aim was easier said than done when the team was effectively tasked with reinventing the wheel and – as Lynge remarked – an unattractive one at that.\nThere are several reasons for the uniformity of the traditional golf buggy, narrow and vertical in shape, Lynge explained. The universal requirement of having to fit onto golf courses and their various cart paths – needing to perform 180-degree turns in a cul-de-sac – limits design creativity.\n“It’s like trying to do a new bicycle or a new motorcycle,” Lynge said. “You’re so heavily constrained from a technical standpoint.\n“It’s the worst kind of shape you can have – it doesn’t look very dynamic. You want something that’s sort of Lamborghini-shaped – very low and wide – but the golf cart is the exact opposite.”\nYet solutions emerged: extending the wheelbase, enlarging the cabin, unprecedented 12-inch alloy wheels without hubcaps that replaced the traditional “deep dish” look, and a double wishbone front suspension – common in sports cars – to boost handling.\nGaria’s vehicles may look bigger and more “muscular” than the average golf cart, but the proportions are the same as any other standard buggy. This is simply a visual “trick” – and far from the only one.\nA storage box tucked behind the seat serves to lift the beltline, slashing cabin space to give it more of a car feel, while accent lines and wheels pushed out to the edges help ground the vehicle.\nLynge toyed extensively with positive and negative space, taking inspiration from Porsche’s 911 to use convex and concave shapes across the car. It makes warehouse storage a “nightmare,” but the visual payoffs are worth the trouble, Lynge says.\nIn fact, it is rare that any two Garias look exactly the same.\nUsing an online configurator inspired by Nike’s shoe customizer, prospective buyers can hand-pick almost every aspect of their vehicle; from body and roof color – 44 options and rising – to wheels and interior features like refrigerators and cup holders. There are millions of possible combinations, Lynge insists.\nGerman luxury car modification firm Mansory, which works with clients including Bentley and Lamborghini, provides a range of accessories and even a full carbon-fiber car.\nRelated article\n16-year-old amateur Kris Kim wows golf world by making cut on PGA Tour debut\nOther collaborations have included German Bugatti supplier Kussmaul, which Garia paired with to build a single, special edition chrome car capable of doing 0 to 40 kilometers per hour (25 miles per hour) in less than two seconds.\nAnother involved Mercedes, whom Lynge first made contact with after winning a competition run by the car giant to design a golf cart. Lynge took the prize ceremony event as an opportunity to pitch a dream that would be realized in 2016 – a Garia golf car inspired by Mercedes-Benz Style.\nRetailing at just under €80,000 ($86,000), the fully carbon-fiber car had twice the battery life and twice the power of a typical Garia, topping out at speeds of 69 kilometers per hour (43 miles per hour).\n“Really expensive … super exclusive, but also the coolest golf car you’ll ever see,” Lynge said.\nIts scarcity means only a select few will have been seen on European roads.\nMaking street legal models was always the plan for Garia, but achieving certification is no easy feat. Extensive – and therefore expensive – safety and crash testing is required to gain road-status, and requirements differ across regions.\nWhile Europe allows for greater speeds, the US employs a strict 40 kilometers per hour (25 miles per hour) legal limit on such vehicles. But that did not discourage Lynge, who saw the prevalence of golf communities in the US as a potentially lucrative market for Garia. The company was sold by the Lars Larsen Group to American golf and utility giant Club Car in 2022.\nThe base version of Garia’s two-seater golf car – without any customization or additional features – has a manufacturer suggested retail price of €14,939 ($16,100), with the four-seater edition starting from €20,189 ($21,770). The street legal variants for both Europe and the US come in at €18,959 ($20,440) for the two-seat model and rise to €21,219 ($22,880) for four seats.\n“We very much felt that these cars are so fun to drive and they are fun to interact with,” Lynge said. “I don’t know the exact percentage, but a great part of our cars are also bought by people who don’t play golf. They are just in a holiday house.”\nAs he looks to the future, Lynges envisions Garia branching out of golf and into the leisure space, becoming “more-and-more car-like” with each passing year, making vehicles suited to urban mobility.\n“If you drive around London, how fast do you even need to go? Forty-three miles per hour is plenty of opportunity, right? There is some weird sort of space there as the market changes into full electric where everything is sort of up in the air,” he said.\n“I don’t know where we’re going to land, but I feel like we have some interesting lessons with us in this journey we’ve been on that puts us in a good position to do mobility, maybe in a wider sense, than just golf.”\n",

At the time, Biden said the U.S. planned to invest $250 million in the project, which will create a route from Lobito Port in Angola through Zambia to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Eventually, future developments would expand the route into Tanzania, which would create a rail line route between the Indian and Atlantic oceans.\nThe project is part of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI), which is \"G7's flagship infrastructure and investment initiative,\" according to the White House. G7 is an intergovernmental political and economic forum consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.\nBiden recently touched on the PGI progress during the 2024 G7 Summit in Fasano, Italy, according to a White House fact sheet published on Thursday. During this year's summit, Italy committed $320 million of \"grant, equity and debt capital to finance a new 800-kilometer greenfield rail section of the envisioned first open-access trans-continental rail network,\" and the United Kingdom agreed to contribute funds for geological surveying along the corridor.\n\"President Biden also highlighted progress on PGI economic corridors that reflect how the USG is working with partners to boost infrastructure investment in emerging markets, emphasizing strategic economic corridor development for multisector impact across countries,\" the White House fact sheet said.\n\"Additionally, the United States accelerated support to develop the Lobito Economic Corridor, the PGI flagship economic corridor announced by President Biden at the 2023 G7 Summit, that supports critical transportation infrastructure in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Zambia, including the first open-access transcontinental rail network in Africa.\"\nNewsweek reached out to the White House via email for comment.\nOnce complete, the corridor will enable \"additional investment in agribusiness to enhance food security, digital infrastructure, and expanded access to clean power,\" according to the White House.\n\"PGI continues to pursue additional opportunities to connect the initial Lobito Corridor investments across the continent, to Tanzania and, ultimately, the Indian Ocean all while creating quality jobs and improving lives,\" the fact sheet said.\nOnce completed, the corridor will redirect mine products, such as metals like cobalt, copper, and lithium needed for electric vehicle battery production and wind turbines, to a port in Angola. This would cut down on export expenses and move resources more efficiently, according to a 2023 report by WRAL.\n",

    "content": "New analyses of the longest clinical trial yet of the weight-loss drug Wegovy are shedding light on how quickly it helps people lose weight, how long they sustain that weight loss and how safe the medicine is over four years of use.\nRelated article\nAt least 25,000 people in the US are starting weight-loss drug Wegovy each week, drugmaker says\nThe analyses – of a trial called Select, whose results showed last year that Wegovy significantly reduced heart risk in addition to helping with weight loss – also suggest that the drug may protect the heart in ways beyond weight loss alone, researchers said, raising new questions about how the wildly popular medicines in this drug class should be used – and covered by insurers.\n“The implications are profound,” said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist and scientist at Yale University and Yale New Haven Hospital who was not involved in the research, noting that a second study this week showed a similar finding for heart failure. “We have not encountered a drug with such a breadth of heart benefits.”\nMore than 25,000 people in the US are starting Wegovy every week, drugmaker Novo Nordisk said this month. And in a KFF poll released Friday, 6% of respondents said they were currently using a drug in this class, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists. That translates to more than 15 million Americans.\nOne important question about these blockbuster medicines is how widely – and how long – they’ve been studied. The Select trial, which was funded by Novo Nordisk, showed last year that Wegovy reduced the risk of a heart attack, stroke or heart-related death by 20% in people with existing cardiovascular risk with obesity or who are overweight. It included more than 17,600 people from 41 countries between 2018 and 2021 and followed them for several years.\nResearchers have continued to mine the data, and the new analyses, presented Monday at the European Congress on Obesity and published in the journal Nature Medicine, show results for people taking Wegovy as long as four years. Here are some major takeaways:\nThe analysis showed an average weight loss of just over 10% for people who used semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy, compared with 1.5% for study participants who got a placebo. The researchers, led by Dr. Donna Ryan of Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, noted that the trend showed that participants on the medication typically lost weight for about 65 weeks, or a year and three months, before reaching a plateau.\nA previous clinical trial showed even greater average weight loss for Wegovy: about 15% on average over 68 weeks, compared with 2.4% for people who got a placebo. The researchers on the new analysis noted that, in addition to some differences in the people who enrolled in each trial, the previous study was designed specifically for weight loss and included more structured lifestyle interventions about diet and exercise compared with the Select trial, which was designed to test whether the drug prevented cardiac events.\nThe results showed that the 10% average weight loss for people using Wegovy was sustained for up to 208 weeks, or four years.\nPatients stayed on the medicine while they sustained the weight loss. Other studies have shown that many people regain weight after stopping the drugs, including one published in December from Novo Nordisk competitor Eli Lilly: People using the GLP-1 drug Zepbound, which uses the active ingredient tirzepatide and targets a second hormone called GIP, lost an average of 21% of their body weight over 36 weeks. The participants were then split into two groups, and those who stayed on the medicine lost an additional 5.5% of their body weight, while those who unknowingly switched to a placebo regained 14% of their weight.\nHowever, not everybody regained so much weight. The study also looked at how many people maintained at least 80% of the weight loss after the initial 36 weeks, and while many more who continued on the drug did – almost 90% - almost 17% of people who were switched to a placebo maintained that much weight loss without the drug.\nIn the new analysis, the researchers reported that after two years, about 68% of people taking Wegovy had lost at least 5% of their body weight, while 21% of people on a placebo did. Almost 23% of people on Wegovy lost at least 15% of their body weight, compared with 1.7% on a placebo. And almost 5% of people on the drug lost more than 25% of their body weight, compared with 0.1% on placebo, showing that the top-line findings from studies are just averages; everyone has a different experience with medicines.\nOverall, more people on Wegovy decided to stop participating in the trial because of side effects than people who got a placebo: 17% of those on the drug versus 8% on placebo, a result that was previously reported. And the side effects were ones that are widely known with these medicines: mainly gastrointestinal disorders like nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and constipation, which usually affected people in the first few months of the study as the dose of the medicine increased.\nThe researchers noted that there were no new safety signals seen in the latest analyses. Acute pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas, wasn’t seen at a higher rate among those on Wegovy than placebo, although gallbladder disorders like gallstones were: 2.8% for people on Wegovy, compared with 2.3% for people on placebo. Both are included in warnings in the drug’s prescribing information because they’d been seen previously in trials.\nA key question when the full results of the Select trial were initially presented was whether the 20% reduction in heart risk was driven by weight-loss alone or some other protective effect of the drug. The new analysis suggests that there is something else at play.\nThat’s because the reduction in risk of heart attack or other events was seen even in people using Wegovy who didn’t lose weight.\nRelated article\nWeight-loss drug Wegovy offers benefits for people with diabetes and common form of heart failure, study finds\n“You probably don’t even need to lose weight to get the cardiovascular benefit” with semaglutide and similar medicines, said Dr. Daniel Drucker, a pioneer of research into GLP-1 at the University of Toronto who wasn’t involved in the new analyses. “That’s because that’s what GLP-1 does: It’s cardio-protective, at least in animals, independent of whether or not you have diabetes, independent of whether you have obesity, and you don’t require weight loss – it’s not the whole story.”\nAn analysis led by John Deanfield of University College London found that the reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in the study for those on Wegovy, compared with placebo, was similar among people who lost 5% or more of their body weight and those who lost less than that or even those who gained weight.\n“This suggests alternative mechanisms of improved cardiovascular outcome beyond reduction in adiposity,” or body fat, the researchers concluded.\nA separate study published Monday about heart failure, for which Wegovy has shown a major benefit, suggested the same thing, Krumholz said.\n“These two studies show that these anti-obesity medications are also heart-health drugs,” he wrote in an email. “The benefits to the heart for people with established cardiovascular disease or a certain type of heart failure occur regardless of the amount of weight loss.”\nDrucker suspects that GLP-1 drugs provide these kinds of benefits by reducing inflammation.\n“We can’t ignore the reduction in blood pressure or triglycerides, and the reduction in body weight must help a little bit, and glucose must help a little as well,” he said.\nBut based on his lab’s research, he said, “one of my favorite theories is inflammation, because we know that people with cardiovascular disease do have increased inflammation in their blood vessels and in the heart.”\nSign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\nDrucker said studies have shown that GLP-1 drugs tamp down harmful inflammation, which his lab is studying. He even noted that he receives communications from people with conditions like Covid-related brain fog, ulcerative colitis and arthritis – driven by inflammation – who think their symptoms have improved while using GLP-1 medicines. Those links would need to be borne out in clinical studies to be considered definitive.\nThe results in the Select trial, he said, raise the question of whether people who don’t have obesity or aren’t overweight but who have had a heart attack or stroke could benefit from taking a drug like Wegovy to prevent another event – another thing that would need to be studied.\nAnd, Drucker said, the results suggest that insurers should cover the medicines, which cost about $1,000 per month or more without it, more widely.\n“We probably really need to rethink these criteria for reimbursing the medicines, because they are not going to be helpful in terms of actually improving health and saving lives and saving health care dollars,” he said. “You don’t even need to lose weight to have a reduction in heart attack, strokes and death.”\n",

    "content": "New analyses of the longest clinical trial yet of the weight-loss drug Wegovy are shedding light on how quickly it helps people lose weight, how long they sustain that weight loss and how safe the medicine is over four years of use.\nRelated article\nAt least 25,000 people in the US are starting weight-loss drug Wegovy each week, drugmaker says\nThe analyses – of a trial called Select, whose results showed last year that Wegovy significantly reduced heart risk in addition to helping with weight loss – also suggest that the drug may protect the heart in ways beyond weight loss alone, researchers said, raising new questions about how the wildly popular medicines in this drug class should be used – and covered by insurers.\n“The implications are profound,” said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist and scientist at Yale University and Yale New Haven Hospital who was not involved in the research, noting that a second study this week showed a similar finding for heart failure. “We have not encountered a drug with such a breadth of heart benefits.”\nMore than 25,000 people in the US are starting Wegovy every week, drugmaker Novo Nordisk said this month. And in a KFF poll released Friday, 6% of respondents said they were currently using a drug in this class, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists. That translates to more than 15 million Americans.\nOne important question about these blockbuster medicines is how widely – and how long – they’ve been studied. The Select trial, which was funded by Novo Nordisk, showed last year that Wegovy reduced the risk of a heart attack, stroke or heart-related death by 20% in people with existing cardiovascular risk with obesity or who are overweight. It included more than 17,600 people from 41 countries between 2018 and 2021 and followed them for several years.\nResearchers have continued to mine the data, and the new analyses, presented Monday at the European Congress on Obesity and published in the journal Nature Medicine, show results for people taking Wegovy as long as four years. Here are some major takeaways:\nThe analysis showed an average weight loss of just over 10% for people who used semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy, compared with 1.5% for study participants who got a placebo. The researchers, led by Dr. Donna Ryan of Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, noted that the trend showed that participants on the medication typically lost weight for about 65 weeks, or a year and three months, before reaching a plateau.\nA previous clinical trial showed even greater average weight loss for Wegovy: about 15% on average over 68 weeks, compared with 2.4% for people who got a placebo. The researchers on the new analysis noted that, in addition to some differences in the people who enrolled in each trial, the previous study was designed specifically for weight loss and included more structured lifestyle interventions about diet and exercise compared with the Select trial, which was designed to test whether the drug prevented cardiac events.\nThe results showed that the 10% average weight loss for people using Wegovy was sustained for up to 208 weeks, or four years.\nPatients stayed on the medicine while they sustained the weight loss. Other studies have shown that many people regain weight after stopping the drugs, including one published in December from Novo Nordisk competitor Eli Lilly: People using the GLP-1 drug Zepbound, which uses the active ingredient tirzepatide and targets a second hormone called GIP, lost an average of 21% of their body weight over 36 weeks. The participants were then split into two groups, and those who stayed on the medicine lost an additional 5.5% of their body weight, while those who unknowingly switched to a placebo regained 14% of their weight.\nHowever, not everybody regained so much weight. The study also looked at how many people maintained at least 80% of the weight loss after the initial 36 weeks, and while many more who continued on the drug did – almost 90% - almost 17% of people who were switched to a placebo maintained that much weight loss without the drug.\nIn the new analysis, the researchers reported that after two years, about 68% of people taking Wegovy had lost at least 5% of their body weight, while 21% of people on a placebo did. Almost 23% of people on Wegovy lost at least 15% of their body weight, compared with 1.7% on a placebo. And almost 5% of people on the drug lost more than 25% of their body weight, compared with 0.1% on placebo, showing that the top-line findings from studies are just averages; everyone has a different experience with medicines.\nOverall, more people on Wegovy decided to stop participating in the trial because of side effects than people who got a placebo: 17% of those on the drug versus 8% on placebo, a result that was previously reported. And the side effects were ones that are widely known with these medicines: mainly gastrointestinal disorders like nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and constipation, which usually affected people in the first few months of the study as the dose of the medicine increased.\nThe researchers noted that there were no new safety signals seen in the latest analyses. Acute pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas, wasn’t seen at a higher rate among those on Wegovy than placebo, although gallbladder disorders like gallstones were: 2.8% for people on Wegovy, compared with 2.3% for people on placebo. Both are included in warnings in the drug’s prescribing information because they’d been seen previously in trials.\nA key question when the full results of the Select trial were initially presented was whether the 20% reduction in heart risk was driven by weight-loss alone or some other protective effect of the drug.

    "content": "The U.S. is in the midst of a multistate outbreak of bird flu, with 1 in 5 commercial milk samples testing positive for genetic traces of the virus. But does the virus pose any threat to humans?\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza is an infectious viral illness that spreads primarily among wild and domestic birds. But the virus that causes bird flu can sometimes jump into animals, including dairy cows and, in some cases, humans.\n\"Bird flu, or avian influenza, infects more than 100 species of wild birds, especially migratory waterfowl,\" Carl Abraham, an assistant professor of medicine at the New York Institute of Technology, told Newsweek. \"In birds, it is highly contagious [and] causes a respiratory illness that is categorized as either highly pathogenic or low pathogenic.\n\"Pathogenicity relates to how sick the infected animal is, and highly pathogenic avian influenza [which is the form of the disease causing the current outbreak] has the ability to spread beyond the airways and lungs to infect multiple organs often resulting in death in birds within 48 hours.\"\nOver the last decade, bird flu cases in mammals have been on the rise.\n\"In most cases, mammal infection is thought to occur after the animal eats an infected bird,\" Abraham said.\n\"In 2024, the first reports of avian influenza (H5N1 strain) infected U.S. domesticated cattle that is possibly being transmitted cow-to-cow. This is now a multistate outbreak although the numbers of cattle infected in each state is small and the illness marked by transient reductions in milk production.\"\nDespite the relatively small number of infected cows, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has identified genetic traces of the virus in 1 in 5 commercial milk samples tested. The virus fragments are not actually capable of causing an infection—the process of pasteurization has seen to that—but the findings raise concerns about the risks associated with unpasteurized \"raw milks.\"\nIn a recent report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, researchers warned that such unpasteurized milk posed a significant for potential cross-species infections. In particular, the study focused on the risks to domestic cats, who have developed fatal infections after drinking unpasteurized milk from affected cows.\n\"Our findings support those of previous work that has shown domestic cats can be highly susceptible to HPAI A (H5N1) virus,\" the study's first author, Eric Burrough, a professor of veterinary medicine at Iowa State University, told Newsweek. \"Cats that have outdoor access should be monitored to avoid potential exposure to and consumption of dead wild birds.\"\n\"It is rare for avian influenza to infect humans,\" Abraham said. \"Two cases have been reported in the U.S., both in persons with significant exposure to infected mammals—most recently this year in a cattle worker in Texas who had conjunctivitis [pink eye] as the only symptom. Therefore, the risk of illness to humans is extremely low.\n\"Persons who own birds that come into contact with wild birds and cattle farmers are at most risk to come into contact with bird flu, but the risk of illness in those persons is still negligible.\"\nHowever, as we saw in 2020, viruses can evolve fast.\nRead more: Compare Top Health Savings Accounts\n\"Influenza has a complicated replication cycle within multiple species,\" Abraham said. \"This frequently causes the genes of different strains within a single host to mix, commonly referred to as recombination events.\n\"Most recombination events result in influenza viruses that are not able to replicate or replicate less efficiently. However, rare recombination events may increase illness severity, increase transmission, or even, as we are seeing with cattle this year, infection of new species. It is possible for a recombination event to give avian influenza the ability to infect humans.\n\"If the same virus caused human-to-human transmission, it could have pandemic potential. Again, this would be a rare event, but it is possible.\"\nWhile no significant threat has been identified for humans, Abraham added that studying viral transmission patterns like this could help predict and prevent future pandemics.\n\"The new information gained as we study viral outbreaks helps us to prepare for the next pandemic [not an \"if,\" but a \"when\" scenario],\" he said. \"Responses to outbreaks based on scientific evidence are most likely to result in the best public health outcome. What we learn today may save us tomorrow. That which we ignore puts as at risk. Stay safe.\"\nIs there a health problem that's worrying you? Let us know via health@newsweek.com.

    "content": "Texting on the Moon? Streaming on Mars? It may not be as far away as you think.\nThat’s the shared vision of NASA and Nokia, who have partnered to set up a cellular network on the Moon to help lay the building blocks for long-term human presence on other planets.\nA SpaceX rocket is due to launch this year — the exact date has yet to be confirmed — carrying a simple 4G network to the Moon. The lander will install the system at the Moon’s south pole and then it will be remotely controlled from Earth.\n“The first challenge to getting a network up and running is having a space-qualified cellular equipment that meets the appropriate size, weight, and power requirements, as well as being deployed without a technician,” Walt Engelund, deputy associate administrator for programs at NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, told CNN. No less of a challenge, it will need to operate in the harsh lunar environment of extreme temperatures and radiation.\nThe 4G network unit is being built by Nokia’s Bell Labs using a range of off-the-shelf commercial components. It will be loaded onto a lander made by US company Intuitive Machines, and once deployed it will connect the lander via radio equipment to two roaming vehicles with their own special mission: to search for ice.\nOne of the vehicles, the Lunar Outpost rover, will explore the area known as Shackleton Connecting Ridge, while the other, the Micro-Nova hopper, will plunge into a crater to scan for unprecedented up-close evidence of Moon ice.\nImages of ice — transmitted back to the lander and then Earth in near real-time via the cellular network — would be a world-first. Lunar ice could be used to create breathable oxygen, and even fuel that could eventually be used to launch Mars missions from the Moon.\nFor NASA’s Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon this decade, cellular connectivity is invaluable.\nCurrently, astronauts talk to each other by radio, but NASA wants a lunar communications system capable of supporting high-resolution video and science data, said Engelund — especially as Artemis missions become more sophisticated.\n“Being able to communicate on the Moon is critical to Artemis — as critical as any other mission element like power, water to drink, and air to breathe,” said Engelund.\n“Eventually, this effort will help establish a lunar communications network that could give our explorers the ability to beam scientific data back, confer with mission control, and talk to their families, as if they were walking down the street on their cellphones.”\nIt could lay the groundwork for an off-world internet not dissimilar to that of Earth’s. Personal devices could connect to such networks, allowing ﻿space colonists to use smartphones that can access all the apps and services available to those back on Earth.\nNASA selected Bell Labs as part of its Tipping Point initiative, a series of partnerships with companies to develop technologies for future missions that puts them in prime position for key roles in the future space economy.\nBell Labs was given a $14.1 million grant in 2020, and in January, Nokia was selected by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to begin working on a communications services infrastructure that will eventually serve as the “framework for the lunar economy.”\n“A future lunar economy will critically depend on communication technologies to collect and analyze data, share information, and maintain and control operations,” Thierry Klein, president of Bell Labs Solutions Research, told CNN.\n“This includes sustaining a semi-permanent or permanent human presence on the Moon, as well as automated robotic operations for transportation, resource mining, mineral processing and scientific data collection.”\nThere are potential commercial benefits for Earthly business ventures too.\nIf a network can withstand the journey into orbit, then deploy and endure autonomously amid the vacuum of space, wildly fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation, it will be able to survive the harshest locations on Earth — such as polar ice caps, deserts, or offshore platforms.\n“Especially when it comes to remote deployments, industrial sites, public safety, emergency response, disaster recovery or defense, it is highly beneficial to have compact, low-footprint network equipment that can be easily transported and deployed anywhere,” Klein said.\n",

    "content": "Senate Republicans on Thursday blocked a bill put forth by Democrats to codify broad federal protections for in vitro fertilization (IVF) nationwide.\nOnly two Republicans sided with Democrats in the 48-47 vote: Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.\nThe IVF process involves extracting eggs from a woman's ovaries and fertilizing them with sperm in a laboratory. The fertilized eggs, or embryos, are then cultured before being implanted into the woman's uterus.\nIVF treatment became a heated political topic after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling federally guaranteeing abortion access, in June 2022. In February, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos used in IVF must legally be treated as children under state law, but the decision was later reversed by the state Legislature.\nRepublican senators criticized the Democrats' Right to IVF Act, which needed 60 votes to pass, as overreaching in its aim. Instead, they had submitted their own legislation, which Democrats said didn't go far enough and blocked on Wednesday.\nOn Thursday, Murkowski explained her vote in a post to X, formerly Twitter.\n\"In vitro fertilization is a crucial part of reproductive health, allowing couples with fertility challenges to grow their families. Today I voted to move to consider 'The Right to IVF Act,' legislation that would establish in federal statute the right for an individual to access IVF treatment, which has been called into question at the state level,\" she said.\n\"I have significant reservations about the bill's overly broad mandates for insurers to pay for treatment costs—but I want to be clear on my support for a family's right to access IVF. I hope that we can work toward a bipartisan solution to protect access to IVF.\"\nNewsweek contacted Collins' office via email on Thursday for comment.\nPresident Joe Biden denounced the Senate members who didn't support the act in a written statement.\n\"Once again, Senate Republicans refused to protect access to fertility treatments for women who are desperately trying to get pregnant,\" Biden said. \"And just last week, Senate Republicans blocked nationwide protections for birth control. The disregard for a woman's right to make these decisions for herself and her family is outrageous and unacceptable.\"\nRepublican Senator John Cornyn of Texas explained to reporters after the vote why he didn't support the legislation.\n\"Why should we vote for a bill that fixes a non-existent problem? There's not a problem. There's no restrictions on IVF, nor should there be,\" Cornyn said, according to CNN.\n",

    "content": "Russia's military has adapted to the high losses of troops on the battlefield in Ukraine and it is likely to continue its tactic of throwing troops forward during offensives until the end of the war, according to British military officials.\nThe term \"meat grinder\" is used to describe Russia's tactic of sending waves of often ill-trained and ill-equipped soldiers to wear down Ukrainian forces and expose their locations to Russian artillery. Using this method, Russia's gains have been incremental but its forces have built on momentum following the capture of Avdiivka in the Donetsk oblast, albeit at a huge cost.\nAccording to Ukraine's latest figures released on Saturday, Russian forces suffered losses of more than 1,000 for the seventh day in a row, with the 1,260 casualties of both killed and wounded taking the war's total to 473,400.\nWhile an accurate count of Russian personnel losses is tricky to calculate, it is not far off the 465,000 estimate given on Saturday by the U.K. Ministry of Defense (MOD) which said casualties will increase again in May and June amid renewed offensive operations in the east of Ukraine. This follows \"a slight decrease in the pace of operations\" over the last two months, it added.\n\"It is likely that despite the extreme cost in life, Russia has fully adapted its military to attritional warfare which relies on mass over quality,\" the British officials said.\n\"This reliance on mass will almost certainly continue for the duration of the Ukraine war and have long-lasting effects on Russia's future army.\"\nNewsweek has contacted the Russian defense ministry for comment on the latest British daily assessment which tends to highlight Moscow's losses and Ukraine's gains.\nUkraine and the U.K.'s estimates of Russian casualties roughly chime with those given by France, whose foreign minister Stéphane Séjourne told independent outlet Novaya Gazyeta had reached 500,000, 150,000 of whom had been killed.\nRussia has not given any update to its tally of losses since it said in September 2022 that just under 6,000 troops had been killed.\nUkraine has not given an update of its losses since President Volodymyr Zelensky said in February that 31,000 of his troops had been killed. However, Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu said on Friday that Kyiv's troop losses had surpassed 111,000.\nMeanwhile, independent outlet Mediazona has been working with BBC News Russian service to compile the number of deaths of Russia's soldiers, drawing on publicly available information such as obituaries and online notices. Their latest figures revealed on April 26 that at least 51,679 Russian troops had been killed, although they emphasize the actual number of deaths was likely a lot higher.\n",

    "content": "Father's Day can be a poignant and challenging holiday for single moms, and it can feel like there's no escaping it.\nSociety's emphasis on a traditional family unit can serve as a reminder of an absent partner, whether due to divorce, separation, abandonment or other circumstances, which can make single moms feel like they're under the spotlight.\nRead more: Best Savings Accounts for Kids and Teens\nMoms who parent alone often have to navigate their own emotions while comforting and supporting their children—a delicate balancing act.\nIn 2023 there were just over 15 million children (about twice the population of New Jersey) living with a single mother in the U.S..\nLucy Dartford, a single mom to six-year-old Zuri, made the difficult decision to become a single parent to protect and give her daughter the best start in life.\nRead more: How a Personal Finance Expert Teaches Her Kids About Money\nShe explains the Father's Day traditions, such as making cards at school or friends saying \"Happy Father's Day,\" can bring up anxieties around how Zuri is feeling.\n\"It brings up slight pangs of nervousness about how she's managing all these narratives alongside feelings of guilt; that I should somehow have a father figure for her.\"\nThis is all too common for single moms, as the day can amplify the pressure to fulfill both roles and stir feelings of frustration as they reflect on their situation and what could have been.\nMarika Lindholm, founder of the social platform ESME (a website dedicated to Empowering Solo Moms Everywhere) and co-editor of the new book Between Us: Healing Ourselves and Changing the World Through Sociology, recognizes the challenges of having to go above and beyond to compensate for the missing parent.\nAfter going through a painful divorce, she found herself as a solo mom to two kids, juggling work and family life.\n\"When the kids are really young, it's kind of the mom's responsibility to set the tone.\n\"I know some moms create rituals around the day, like going to the zoo, but then they also have to be cognizant when they get to the zoo, their kids might be seeing all these other kids with their dads, so I think they're walking carefully trying to respect the kids and work out the best scenario.\"\nDartford, who is the Founder of communications consultancy We Are Lucy, said Father's Day isn't ignored in their world, but she and Zuri take certain steps to consider other perspectives.\n\"At Zuri's age, I don't hide anything from her, and I keep a very open narrative,\" she explains.\n\"I don't go into too much detail around the behaviors or the lead-up to the decision to protecting her, but we talk about being safe, supportive, loved and what that looks like.\"\nStephanie Manes, a single mother, family therapist, licensed clinical social worker and psychotherapist who teaches at Columbia University, advises asking your children how they feel about the day, as these feelings can change from year to year.\n\"If you're a single parent by choice or if your kids have two mothers, be prepared to have more conversations about their own origin and to give them a way to think about the meaning of father in your own family.\n\"No matter what, just listen and validate. If they ask questions, try to answer in a straightforward but age-appropriate way.\"\nOne particular book that Dartford said really helped was The Great Big Book of Families by Mary Hoffman, which she said was \"incremental\" in navigating Father's Day.\nIn preparation for this Sunday, Dartford also spoke to her daughter's school and asked if they could be mindful of the situation and not put so much emphasis on having to write a card for a dad.\n\"I've got some amazing male friends in my life who are fantastic dads and Zuri sees that; she has play dates with their children.\n\"I surround Zuri with remarkable role models who I can also call my friends.\"\nLindholm says having other male role models is an excellent mechanism for single moms on Father's Day.\n\"Father's Day can be an opportunity to honor the other men in your life,\" she says.\n\"Male role models can be uncles, grandfathers, coaches or others who aren't part of your kids' daily lives.\n\"I also know other moms who have created their own rituals, and one example comes from an article on ESME, where the children's father had died, so they do all the things he used to love to do, such as put on a jersey and watch the soccer and eat Vegemite.\"\nDartford is familiar with this reframing and uses Father's Day to celebrate the unique bond she has with Zuri.\nOn the day itself, they'll be celebrating with Zuri's grandfather. \"It will be a day of support, love, nourishment, all the all the good stuff. I know that my sister will also come and bring me flowers and wish me a happy Father's Day,\" says Dartford.\nDartford is also into her fitness, so they'll also be participating in the Turf Games (and Turf Kids for Zuri)—a team-based competitive fitness event in London.\n\"There's something quite interesting about what might be considered a bit of a stereotypical man's job on the actual day,\" muses Dartford.\n\"But Zuri will be there, cheering me on lifting weights.\"\nNaturally, Dartford dedicates her whole life to ensuring that Zuri's well-being is taken care of and admitted that she often puts herself last: \"I have to be gentle on myself and be aware that things look different for us, but that doesn't mean it's bad.\"\nLindholm can relate. As a mom of five (Marika has two children with her ex-husband and three children with her current spouse, two of whom are adopted), she understands the never-ending balance.\n\"Women who parent on their own are sleep deprived, work too hard and do everything for their kids 24/7, and maybe this is the moment they say, 'wow, look what I've done this past year' look how much I've accomplished and what a great mother I am.\"\nManes reassures single moms that it's OK to want self-recognition \"for how tough it can be to fulfill maternal and paternal function.\n\"Do something special for yourself, even if it's carving out an hour to take a walk-cry.\n\"If you have other single mother friends, find something fun to do together. Nothing is stopping you from making your own kind of party.\"\nFather's Day for single moms isn't just about coping and getting through the day. It's about celebrating the unique journey they are on.\nBy creating new traditions, seeking support and maintaining open communication, single moms can navigate the complexities of the day with grace and strength.\nDartford said: \"I've made a decision for the protection, development and safety of my daughter, and we may not fit in with the standard Father's Day, but I know that this will pay off in the long run because she'll have a stable future.\"\n",

Sources says they are giving the former No. 1 pick a five-year extension worth $275M — $55M a year — with $200M guaranteed and $142M fully. Lawrence's agent Jay Courie of @mgcsports did the deal.\"\nWhat makes this deal impressive and record-tying is the $55 million a year places Lawrence at the top of the quarterback earners with Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow.\nBurrow had been the only quarterback that reached $55 million per year, with the next closest figure belonging to Detroit Lions quarterback Jared Goff, who makes $53 million per year.\nGoff and the Lions recently signed an extension in May, catapulting him to the second highest-earning spot in the NFL. Now, with Lawrence making as much as Burrow, Goff drops down to third.\nLawrence was drafted No. 1 overall in the 2021 NFL draft by the Jaguars with the hopes that he would become their long-awaited next franchise quarterback. Lawrence got off to a rocky start as he secured 3,641 yards, 12 touchdowns, 17 interceptions, 334 rushing yards, and two rushing touchdowns in his first season. Though he came under plenty of scrutiny, he still showcased elite talent.\nThe 2022 season was far better for Lawrence, as he passed for 4,113 yards, 25 touchdowns, eight interceptions, 291 rushing yards, and five rushing touchdowns. The bounce-back season led to Lawrence receiving his first and only Pro Bowl nod.\nIn 2023, Lawrence once again secured over 4,000 passing yards, amassing 4,016 yards, 21 touchdowns, 14 interceptions, 339 rushing yards, and four rushing touchdowns.\nIt appears the Jaguars organization can see the value of having Lawrence as part of their plan for the foreseeable future. The new five-year extension locks the young quarterback up through the 2028 season.\nLawrence is only 24 years old and is entering his fourth season in the NFL. Not many quarterbacks can say they threw for over 4,000 yards more than once, especially this early on in their career. He will need to clean up his interceptions moving forward, but this extension does make sense.\nDoes Lawrence deserve to be paid as much as Burrow? Well, that remains to be seen. But he has gotten better every season and the future is bright for him and this Jaguars team.\n",

After disputing an umpire's call on a check-swing appeal, Lopez tossed his glove into the stands as he walked off the field.\nSpeaking to reporters after the game, Lopez was quoted as calling the Mets \"the worst team probably in the whole f***ing MLB.\" Or did he say \"worst teammate,\" as he would later claim? Listen for yourself:\nOn Thursday, Lopez wrote a message in English and Spanish on his Instagram account clarifying his remarks.\n\"First and foremost, I apologize to my teammates, coaches, fans, and front office,\" Lopez wrote. \"I feel that I let them down yesterday, both on and off the field. I also want to clarify my post-game remarks, because I had no intention of disparaging the New York Mets organization. During that interview, I spoke candidly about my frustrations with my personal performance and how I felt it made me 'the worst teammate in the entire league.'\n\"Unfortunately, my efforts to address the media in English created some confusion and generated headlines that do not reflect what I was trying to express. I wish the team the best and hope that God continues to give me strength and guidance in my personal and professional life.\"\nAlthough the disputed quote was intended to be more critical of himself than his team, that's not what got him in hot water with Mets management. Anthony DiComo of MLB.com reports that the decision to designate Lopez for assignment did not depend on the substance of his remarks to reporters.\nMultiple reporters attempted to clarify with Lopez the sentiment he was trying to express. Still, others were quick to bring up the off-the-field struggles Lopez endured last season. Then a member of the Minnesota Twins, the pitcher was placed on the injured list in June 2023 because of a mental health issue.\nLopez's son, Mikael, has endured several well-documented health battles in his young life. Whether that was weighing on his father's heart Wednesday is perhaps an excuse the Mets were unwilling to accept.\nRegardless, the two sides have moved on from a situation that goes well beyond one widely circulated quote.\n",

    "content": "Mong Shuan was just 16 when she turned to an unconventional source of income: selling betel nuts from a little stall in northern Taiwan. The stimulant, a small, oblong fruit derived from areca palms, is chewed by millions of people across Asia. For the next three years, Mong would work six days a week for the equivalent of around $670 a month. A small bonus was tacked on for dressing provocatively to entice male customers.\nHer job was to slice the nuts open and add a pinch of slaked lime (or calcium hydroxide, which increases the body’s absorption of the stimulant they contain), before neatly wrapping each one in a leaf. To meet her sales targets, the betel nut “must be delicious.” she told CNN in an email. But hoping to attract more business, Mong would wear her dyed red hair long, a little makeup and a schoolgirl outfit in the style of Japanese anime character Sailor Moon. “The most important thing is your appearance,” she added.\nVendors like Mong, who left the job in February, are known locally as “betel nut beauties.” The phenomenon emerged in the late 1960s, when the Shuangdong Betel Nut Stand, a stall in rural central Taiwan, successfully marketed their products with a campaign centered on its “Shuangdong Girls.” By the turn of the 21st century, tens of thousands of the neon-lit booths, which dot roadsides and industrial neighborhoods across the island, were staffed by young women.\nHoping to document the phenomenon, photographer Constanze Han spent a month in 2022 driving down the highway connecting the island’s capital, Taipei, to the southern city of Kaohsiung, meeting betel nut beauties along the way. Her fascination with the women dates back to the summer trips she used to make to her grandfather’s courtyard house on the outskirts of Taipei.\n“I loved driving there because there were the betel nut girls,” she recalled in a phone interview. “As a child, I didn’t really understand (who they were). My family had been to Amsterdam one time and we’d walked past the red-light district, so I thought it was a similar thing.”\nRelated article\nHow Taiwan’s new $220 million arts center radically rethinks theater design\nWhile the scenes of women, scantily clad in glass booths, might resemble brothels, selling betel nuts is not widely linked to prostitution in Taiwan. In fact, the women rarely leave their stalls except to approach drivers in their high heels. Nonetheless, the very existence of provocative betel nut beauties seemed strange in “a quiet, conservative culture” like Taiwan’s, said Han, who hoped her project could help dispel some of the stereotypes the women faced.\n“(People with) engrained ideas of respectability, without really knowing or having interacted with these girls, might be like, ‘Oh those are girls from the wrong side of the tracks,’” she said. But in reality, Han added, “they all seemed quite level (headed) and responsible.”\nThe photographer, who grew up between Hong Kong and New York with stints in Latin America, has always been interested in the jobs women take to survive regardless of the stigma associated with them. She was inspired by the work of Susan Meiselas, whose 1970s photo series “Carnival Strippers,” captured women working hard and long hours performing stripteases at carnivals in New England.\n“I always end up gravitating towards women,” said Han, who would spend time getting to know her subjects before asking to take their photos. “The conversation part, where there are no photographs, is such a big part of it. I end up having more honest conversations with women and I feel more curious about the nuances of their experiences.”\nHan photographed 12 women, mostly in their late teens or early 20s, apart from one slightly older subject named Xiao Hong, who dresses more conservatively as she prepares the product wearing bright blue gloves at a betel nut stall in New Taipei City. The others appear drenched in the neon light of their booths or are shot gazing out of the windows; one woman’s face is distorted by the reflection of the busy streets outside. The photographer would spend hours capturing small, quiet moments that reveal the job’s mundane nature.\nHan’s experience as a former fashion editor comes through in the photos, which often look as if they were staged or taken from the pages of a glossy magazine. But it’s important that her images are “as honest as possible,” she said.\nThe women would usually arrive for work in their normal clothes and get changed into more revealing garments in the booths, Han explained. Sometimes, owners would incentivize them to dress in a sexier way, though some of Han’s subjects said they would have done so anyway, because it helps them sell more products.\nOne of the women Han photographed, Ju Ju, is pictured wearing red lingerie as she looks out of her strobe-lit booth in the city of Taoyuan. She began selling betel nuts to help make ends meet, the photographer said, adding that employment opportunities were limited for the young mom, who has no higher education. But Ju Ju has since grown to value the stability of the job. She has now been promoted to a manager position of two booths, and hopes to buy her own stall one day, Han added.\nRelated article\nSecretive power plant in Taiwan opens to  public for the first time — as an art space\nNonetheless, concerns that the women are victims of exploitation persist in Taiwan, and have prompted some regulation over the past two decades. In 2002, for example, the local government in Taoyuan county implemented a strict dress code that requires sellers to cover their breasts, butts and bellies.\nAlthough it is traditionally served by Taiwan’s indigenous communities at important gatherings, use of the addictive stimulant is also declining sharply. The island’s Ministry of Health and Welfare — which notes that users are 28 times more likely to develop oral cancer than non-users — says that fewer than one in 16 Taiwanese men chewed betel nuts in 2018, down more than 43% from 2012.\nAs such, Han’s photos document an aspect of Taiwanese life that may eventually cease to exist. She hopes viewers “can look at it as an interesting phenomenon without too much judgement.”\n“I hope that (the photo series) opens people up to a different idea of — or a curiosity about — Taiwan as a whole.”\n",

    "content": "Editor’s Note: Sara Stewart is a film and culture writer who lives in western Pennsylvania. The views expressed here are her own. View more opinion on CNN.\nThis piece contains mild spoilers for the Netflix series “Ripley” and a scene in the movie “Civil War.”\nAre we finally ready to take another look at why we love to hate sociopaths so much? The answer to that question may depend on how you feel about empathy.\nAn interesting thing happens with Andrew Scott’s portrayal of Tom Ripley in the gorgeous new Netflix adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s novel: He almost disappears into Ripley’s utter lack of charisma.\nThat’s no ding on Scott, who’s incredibly watchable as always. But his rendition of Ripley – highly capable, chameleonic, but never what you’d call charming — represents a refreshing take on one of the most famous sociopaths in literature and film. Some of the most riveting pieces of Steven Zaillian’s new series focus on the grunt work of being a murderous grifter, delving into the messy, frustrating and exhausting aftermath of two murders. Trust Scott to make scrubbing chunky bloodstains off marble stairs absolutely compelling, but it’s not exactly the kind of behavior that makes you come away thinking “that guy’s cool.”\nHis acclaimed performance is one of two new meditations on the concept of the sociopath, an archetype that’s grown a bit stale in pop-cultural consciousness lately. On the one hand, we expect the sociopath to be a menacing figure — and at the same time, more often than not, we kind of expect to root for them. But “Ripley,” along with other recent portrayals of sociopathy, makes the case that it’s ﻿both more interesting and more useful to view sociopathy through a nuanced lens.\nThat’s not to say viewers aren’t entitled to live vicariously through whomever they like — escapism is an invaluable coping mechanism — but we’re living in what Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin has dubbed an “empathy gap,” so it might be a good moment to just take a tiny step back from lionizing stone-cold sociopaths, for whom empathy is not a concern. “It’s fair to conclude we have a serious empathy deficit — a collective inability (or refusal) to see the world from others’ perspectives, to understand people’s fears and hopes and our shared humanity,” wrote Rubin last year.\nRelated article\nWhy ‘Succession’ is starting to fall flat\nTraditionally, the majority of our cherished sociopathic antiheroes in TV and film have been men. Think Tony Soprano, Walter White, Patrick Bateman, Dexter Morgan, Don Draper. I’ve always found it difficult to love mob movies and series: Despite being ostensibly about the horrors of brute violence, “The Sopranos” and “Goodfellas” and all the rest have a singularly passionate fanbase that seems to really have fallen in love with their central villains.\nThis is a notion the New Yorker’s Emily Nussbaum has labeled the “bad fan,” a viewer who misses the critical lens through which a character is presented and instead goes all-in on identifying with them. She traces this dissonance back to Norman Lear’s “All in the Family,” the groundbreaking satirical sitcom of the 1970s whose bigoted lead character Archie Bunker, played by Carroll O’Connor, spawned, despite Lear’s intentions, genuine fans of the character’s behavior, those “who shared Archie’s frustrations with the culture around him, a ‘silent majority’ who got off on hearing taboo thoughts said aloud.”\nOne of the most prominent modern examples of mass bad-fan-baiting is the highly bingeable series “You,” Netflix’s thriller about a bibliophile sociopath with a long trail of bodies in his wake. Star Penn Badgley has taken thirsty fans to task repeatedly on social media, but his Joe Goldberg has continued to be as much a fan-fave as he is a walking, talking red flag representative of the worst the male species has to offer.\nThis month, though, the release of “Ripley” coincided with the arrival of the memoir “Sociopath,” which offers a quite different case for demythologizing the disorder. Author Patric Gagne, a successful therapist who’s married with kids, writes of her lifelong (and largely successful) struggle to quash her more violent urges, and argues that the condition is widely misunderstood, grossly stereotyped, and likely under-diagnosed.\nRelated article\n‘Ripley’ slowly builds a hypnotic series around the talented Andrew Scott\nGagne feels Hollywood’s nearly always gotten it wrong with portrayals of sociopaths, reducing them to a collection of cartoonish, villainous traits. “Contrary to popular belief, there’s nothing inherently immoral about having a limited emotional range,” she wrote in Vogue. “The majority of those whose personalities fall on the sociopathic spectrum have the ability to lead perfectly happy, socially acceptable roles in loving family units. But you wouldn’t know that from common discourse. Television’s talking heads, newspaper articles, and countless magazine headlines continue to disparage and vilify sociopaths, usually by erroneously conflating them with malignant narcissists or stereotyping us based on the worst examples of our personality type – serial killers and monsters.”\nFor her part, Gagne sees a heartening trend in more recent depictions of sociopathic characters such as Jenna Ortega as the often-icy Wednesday Addams on the Netflix show bearing her name. And in Gagne’s telling, the fact that pop cultural depictions are becoming more diverse is testament to how many kinds of people see a bit of themselves there.\nIn fact, I found one of film’s most recent sociopaths to be singularly chilling because of his very plausibility. He’s in Alex Garland’s “Civil War,” the polarizing film about a vaguely-sketched conflict set in the modern-day United States. Jesse Plemons — like Scott, an actor who has delivered uniformly bravura performances — appears in a lone scene you’ll be thinking about for days afterward. His soldier character, wearing rose-colored glasses in a morbidly funny detail, interrogates the film’s central group of journalists about “what kind of Americans” they are —  and shoots the ones who don’t answer to his satisfaction. He’s a very obvious White nationalist and, in critic Owen Gleiberman’s description, a sociopath.\n\n“Garland invests the sequence with a hair-trigger tension, and we recognize, in the Plemons character’s attitude, a reflection of current jingoistic hatred,” Gleiberman wrote. “For a few moments, the movie looks like a reflection of part of America today.” It’s a scene so completely galling it makes it hugely difficult to come away with any kind of admiration in your heart for Plemons, nor a view that he’s any kind of anti-hero.\nFor a country currently grappling with the notion of whether empathy is a strength or a weakness, throwing cold water on easy stereotypes about sociopathy is probably a good thing. If we can embrace the mundane complexity of Scott’s repellent Ripley, and at the same time come to understand that real-life sociopathy is not black and white thanks to authors like Gagne, we’ll be better equipped to understand them. Including the ones taking up a lot of real estate in the public consciousness right now.\n",

Finding somewhere in another country is even more fraught with difficult decisions.\nUnless, of course, you’re Paul Millet.\nIn which case, you land in Italy for the first time, and before the first day is done, you’ve bought yourself a beautiful old house with great views in the middle of southern Italy’s Basilicata region.\nBut Millet, a Los Angeles-based television editor, knew exactly what he was doing. The 54-year-old was lured to Italy by houses being sold for one euro, or just over a dollar. But he quickly realized that these came with a catch – the need to spend thousands to make them livable.\n“I read an article on CNN about the one-euro properties being offered back in 2015 and my interest was definitely piqued,” he says. “I had been to various countries in the European Union on several occasions but never Italy, though it was on my list.\n“I cannot express exactly why I was drawn to the idea of buying a one-euro property and renovating it, but it was something that captured my imagination.”\nInstead, Millet turned his attention to other properties that, while more expensive because they were essentially all ready to move into, were still being sold at bargain prices.\nRelated article\nHow moving from the US to Costa Rica’s ‘blue zone’ transformed this family’s life forever\nFor him, Latronico, a stunning cliff top village in Basilicata, was the perfect destination. The destination had sold only two homes priced at one euro and instead focused its efforts on cheaply offloading renovated or occupiable houses in order to revive its dwindling population.\nAfter listing empty properties online via website https://casalatronico.eu/, liaising between old and prospective new owners, it’s so far sold 50 properties, mostly to American buyers.\nMillet says that he began planning to travel to Italy to buy a house back in 2019, but was thwarted by Covid-19. He finally managed to visit in 2022 after attending a friend’s wedding in Ireland.\nHe picked Latronico because the locals running the house sales program seemed extremely responsive to his inquiries compared to other cheap-home towns he’d contacted prior to his trip.\n“The prices of the houses were super-attractive, especially coming from the Los Angeles area, and the Latronico properties were for the most part in good shape.\n“Unlike the one-euro programs, I was under no obligation to do anything with any house I purchased. Obviously, renovation and making the properties viable was the objective, but as a foreign buyer I could do with it what I wanted. I liked that,” says Millet.\nThe tailored property tour organized by officials in Latronico made him fall in love with the village and he was completely taken by its beauty and the warm reception from locals, he says.\n“At the end of the day, I bought my place and began thinking about renovations and the future,” he adds.\nMillet has no plans to make a permanent move to Latronico. For now he sees it has a bolt hole where he can slow down and unplug.\n“I plan to come at least once a year to get away from it all,” he says. “The place will act as a foothold for future traveling around the EU. I’ll probably list it as a vacation rental for when I am not there to keep the place alive, and share it with family and friends.”\nThe one-bedroom, 60-square-meter house he bought cost 12,000 euros (just under $13,000). He expects to spend up to $35,000 on sprucing it up.\nThe property boasts a balcony, storage attic and a rooftop terrace with a “view to die for,” says Millet, describing the vista as the “cherry on top.”\nRelated article\nThey moved from the US to cook American food in deepest Italy. Here’s what happened\nAlthough the house is small, it has two basements which are being re-purposed, one featuring a cave which once housed livestock and the other an ancient bread oven built into the wall that still works.\nRenovation work is almost complete.\n“There was foundation work needed in the larger of the two basements,” Millet says. “I had a reinforced concrete floor installed and the electrical system was completely replaced.\n“Since the larger basement is so sizable, I decided to turn it into a living space that will include an additional bedroom with a small adjoining sitting room that will also have a half bath and laundry facilities for the house.”\nThe house’s ancient, rough stone walls were whitewashed to brighten up the space. The new concrete floor was stained and sealed.\n“It looks terrific. I just need to add the half-bath, do some additional cosmetic work and get furnishings and it will be done,” Millet adds.\nMillet has kept all the original vintage tiles and will add new modern accent tiles to dress it up. The house exterior will get a fresh coat of paint and he plans to tile both the rooftop terrace and the steps leading to the main entrance door.\nHe says he can’t wait to have friends enjoying sunset cocktails on the terrace and then dinner in the kitchen below afterwards.\nMillet says he was captured by Latronico’s peacefulness, a stark contrast to hectic LA.\n“It’s just such a slower lifestyle here,” he says. “My life in Los Angeles moves so fast. Work deadlines and obligations, and so many social things going on. I do enjoy my life there, but taking a moment to remove myself from that environment is very refreshing. Latronico will definitely help me relax.”\nRelated article\nThis US couple bought a home in the ‘forgotten region’ of Italy. Here’s what happened next\nThe village is so remote and off the beaten track that it doesn’t even show on some navigation apps. Millet says the map application on his mobile has very little idea about how to get around Latronico.\n“Both times I’ve come, the maps app has not successfully led me to the Airbnb I’ve stayed in.  But I figured that out, obviously.”\nWhen tech fails, locals have stepped in to make him feel at home.\n“During my first visit, my Airbnb host met me at the place I was staying and then took me out for coffee at one of the local bars,” he says. “ She introduced me to the bartender and then an older retired gentleman approached and bought me my cappuccino with a big smile.\n“Franca, my host, said it was his way of saying you’re welcome here. It was very endearing. That describes my first hour in Latronico.”\nMillet is thrilled to have picked up local habits like southern Italy’s languorous and expansive lunches – a far cry from the quick, frugal salads of Los Angeles.\nBut he says he’s had no problem piling it up and stretching his waistline.\n“That’s not too difficult to get used to. I just love just taking a break from the day. Even if your day is a relaxing one. So different from LA.”\nThere are however cons of staying in a sleepy Italian village, he says, but it depends on perspective.\n“A remote village is just that… remote.  That’s a pro for someone looking to get away from it all in a beautiful setting, but a con for someone who wants the action of a larger city.\n“Same thing in terms of activities. If someone wants to stay in a place where there’s a wealth of things to see and do, then a remote village is not necessarily for them. But for someone who wants to get away from the hassles of daily life, then a small village like Latronico is perfect.”\nThat said, he adds, Latronico is strategically located in a part of Italy where one can stay in a quiet village and drive to other areas with interesting sites and things to do, like Greek ruins and beaches.\nTackling the sale process without help on the ground isn’t a piece of cake, warns Millet, who also owns a condominium on the Hawaiian island of Maui.\nRelated gallery\nThis US couple bought a 400-year-old Italian tower\n“Navigating the logistics of buying the house was probably the main challenge. Since I don’t live in Italy, figuring out the negotiations and then, once the price was agreed upon, getting the transaction done was potentially an obstacle.”\nHe was supported throughout the entire process by the village’s housing platform founder, Latronico’s former deputy mayor, Vincenzo Castellano, who acts as an intermediary between foreign buyers and local sellers.\nSo, all in all, the negotiation was pretty painless and once the price was agreed upon. Millet signed a notarized power of attorney in the States to allow Castellano to act on his behalf in filing all the paperwork and project-manage the renovation.\nMillet has advice for foreigners wishing to buy property in small villages: “Do your homework” and visit first, living like a local – even if just for one day.\n“I’m the kind of person who really does a deep dive into anything I consider, so that came naturally for me. All the municipalities have different programs, so get an idea of what each involves. Know it will cost some money to get a home ready to go but it can be incredibly affordable and then you will have it to use as you see fit.”\nAbove all, he says, “Make sure the place speaks to you in person, that you love it.”\n",

It was designed to enhance the efficiency of radio relay communication units in field conditions, the SSO said.\nThe aerial footage shows the relay station and the moment it was struck by a drone, causing an explosion, fire and thick plumes of smoke.\n\"Operations personnel from the 3rd Separate Special Purpose Regiment identified a Russian R-416GM digital radio relay station while performing operations on one of the fronts,\" the SSO said, sharing footage of the operation on its social media channels.\n\"Our operatives attacked the enemy target using one of the latest developments recently supplied to the Special Operations Forces,\" the SSO added. \"Due to their accurate fire, the R-416GM station was disabled, disrupting communication between the command post and the terrorist army units.\"\nThe footage was also shared by Ukraine's Defense Ministry on X, formerly known as Twitter, writing: \"For the first time in the history of this war, R-416GM, a modern russian mobile communication station, was destroyed by @SOF_UKR operators.\"\nNewsweek couldn't independently verify when or where the footage was filmed and has contacted Russia's Defense Ministry for comment by email.\nA day earlier, Ukraine's military reported that its forces destroyed at least two S-300/S-400 Russian air defense radar systems in Crimea.\nAnd independent Russian outlet ASTRA reported on its Telegram channel on Wednesday, citing regional emergency services sources, that a Ukrainian strike using U.S.-supplied missiles on a key Russian military air base in annexed Crimea struck two air defense systems and a radar.\nA U.S.-based think tank assessed this week that Kyiv may be conducting an effort aimed at degrading Russian air defenses ahead of anticipated F-16 fighter jet deliveries to Ukraine.\nIf this push is successful, it \"could enable Ukraine to more effectively leverage manned fixed-wing airpower in the long run,\" the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said in its latest analysis of the conflict in Ukraine on Wednesday.\nKyiv's forces may seek to actively degrade Russian air defenses before Ukraine receives a significant number of aircraft \"in order to set conditions for Ukraine's future use of manned fixed-wing airpower closer to frontline areas.\"\n\"Ukrainian forces may be able to eventually work towards a concept of operations that combines fixed-wing airpower to support ground operations if the Ukrainian military receives a sufficient number of fighter jets, Western partners train enough trained pilots, and if Ukraine succeeds in degrading Russian air defense capabilities,\" the ISW added.\nDo you have a tip on a world news story that Newsweek should be covering?

The video went viral with over 1.4 million views and 237,800 likes on TikTok, and needless to say, the internet is divided by her method of transport.\nRead more: Best Credit Cards for Uber and Ridesharing\nArriaga doesn't own a car, but as her job is 14 miles away, walking is out of the question. Many people asked why she can't take public transport, however Arriaga told Newsweek that it's already an hour in an Uber so \"it would take way longer\" by bus or train.\nShe said: \"I don't have a car currently, and I have another job that I do before going to the one that's 14 miles away, with only an hour gap in between. I wouldn't have time to take public transportation as it would take about an hour longer on the bus or train.\"\nShe's been in the role since December 2023, but after moving to a new place this month, she only started taking daily Ubers in June 2024. The journeys currently cost Arriaga $100 a day, and $500 across the full week.\nIt was incredibly \"annoying\" to see $100 leave her account each day, but Arriaga's worked out an arrangement with her employer whereby they will reimburse $50 a day for the costs. She's incredibly thankful for the help, as the Ubers will no longer be \"as much of a loss,\" and it's only going to last for a month.\n\"The office is moving closer to me at the end of the month, which is why I'm OK with paying that much for the commutes for now,\" she added.\nAccording to figures from Statista, the majority of workers (29 percent) have a commute of around 15 to 29 minutes in length, and 22 percent spend less than 15 minutes commuting. Traveling more than an hour, as Arriaga does, was much less popular among commuters, as just 5 percent of people have a journey of between 60 to 119 minutes.\nFollowing the pandemic, remote working became increasingly popular and has become a legacy for many companies. With that in mind, 23 percent, the second highest figure, don't commute to work at all.\nAfter Arriaga posted on TikTok to express her dismay over \"losing money\" on Uber rides, social media users were divided by her choice of transport. Many suggested that she should choose a cheaper alternative.\n\"Half of the comments relate to it, since some people have no other way to get to work, and it does cut into their paycheck. The other half don't fully understand why I do it, so they just assume I'm dumb and are fighting in the comments,\" Arriaga told Newsweek.\nShe never expected the video to go viral, just thinking it was funny and might be intriguing to her followers. But after receiving a lot of questions and backlash online, Arriaga posted a follow-up video providing people with more information about her predicament.\nSpending so much money on Ubers each day has certainly generated attention online, and the viral TikTok video has amassed over 2,100 comments in just a matter of days. One comment reads: \"It's time to just get up an hour earlier and take the bus.\"\nAnother person responded: \"This makes me so glad I can drive and I live 10 minutes away from my job.\"\nWhile others were more understanding, as one TikToker user wrote: \"This was me, literally working to pay for Ubers because by the end of the week my whole check was going to Uber.\"\nAnd another comment says: \"These $40 a day Ubers are literally draining my account.\"\nDo you have a monetary dilemma?

    "content": "Today's leaders accept business disruptions as a given, regardless of whether the drivers of change originate from inside or outside company walls.\nThe rapid adoption of technologies like AI, next-generation cloud services, IoT devices, and more are only accelerating the pace of innovation required by organizations. As leaders, we need to prepare for these evolutions because there's a growing expectation for us to proactively plan for each new wave of disruption.\nYet, while 97% of senior executives now consider organizational resilience as very or somewhat important, nearly half still say they're not fully equipped to manage disruption when it occurs.\nThat's a problem.\nFrom starting my career at West Point and serving as a captain in the military to decades spent working for some of the world's largest technology and data companies, every leadership role I've held has involved finding ways to make the most of disruption.\nThese experiences have taught me a vital lesson: As leaders, our ability to guide our organizations and employees through disruption isn't just talk. Finding opportunities for growth amid uncertainty is a responsibility we must take seriously and a skill set we as leaders can refine.\nIntention alone won't bridge the gap between disruption and opportunity. Leading effectively means getting your hands dirty and providing critical support when it's needed most.\nAcross my diverse leadership experiences, here are three tactics that have served me well:\nAny new challenge — whether it's a major market shift or a pandemic — is best faced head-on. To avoid inaction, my leadership team and I focus on what we call \"big rocks.\" These are key areas where relatively immediate improvements generate outsized, long-term business impacts. Examples of big rocks might include improving customer experience or moving the needle on automation.\nThis philosophy is driven by the reality that it's impossible for me to fine-tune every last business detail (and not the best use of my time either). I'm responsible for charting a course and securing buy-in from our teams. Beyond that, I have to trust that the right talent is in place to execute our company vision in the face of evolving challenges.\nFreeing myself from the expectation that it's my job to fix every problem and address every detail has helped me become a more proactive and future-forward leader — a leader ready to inspire progress, not stand in the way of it. I couple this mentality with owning our strengths. A clear awareness of the areas in which your business is solid frees up resources to effectively tackle the disruptions that truly require your attention to keep up. For example, working in the telecommunications space, I rarely lose sleep over our business model becoming obsolete. As technology continues to evolve, fiber will remain a necessity to power that evolution. Knowing this, we can instead concentrate on innovating our offerings to stay ahead of changing customer demands.\nNot questioning every last detail means I can focus on the bigger picture, apply myself directly to opportunities to evolve the business, and then share that vision with my company and other leaders.\nMy theory is that when our competitors sneeze, it's only a matter of time before we catch a cold. If you haven't already, make a habit of monitoring developments across your industries and competitors. Paying close attention to the market is a simple, yet effective indicator of trends or challenges heading your way.\nThere's no single way to source this information. You might host a customer advisory board or, like my team, produce a weekly digest covering relevant company, industry, and competitor news. It can even be as straightforward as plugging in more often with team members who regularly interact with key stakeholders.\nIt's the intention behind your efforts that matters most. This level of organizational foresight can be difficult to achieve at the employee level, but as leaders, we have the networks and experiences to spot trends as they're happening — and before they land on our doorstep.\nWhether it's economic instability, a healthcare crisis, or quick-turn technology innovations, an agile and supportive company culture can prove the difference between a team that goes under and one that rises above.\nAs a recent example of this dynamic at play, consider that three-fourths of workers shared that their employer's organizational values helped them navigate the COVID-19 pandemic — and 94% of managers reported that a positive workplace culture builds a resilient team.\nAs leaders, there are multiple steps we can take to ensure cultural components help mitigate the impact of disruption on our organizations.\n• We lead by example. We have the organizational visibility and reach to positively impact culture and set the tone for those we work with, both directly and indirectly.\n• We pull the right strings. We're in a position to merge tactical and strategic initiatives that center around core cultural gains. This might look like advocating for upgrading systems that benefit employee experience while working alongside AI to increase efficiency and scale.\n• We know when to ask for help. It's just as important to ask for help as it is to lead. For example, at my company, we've prioritized bringing in trusted corporate culture leaders to help guide me and my direct reports on key initiatives.\nAs leaders, it's time to rethink our default reaction to disruption. Don't panic.\nThe more we face disruptions head-on, the better we become at leading our organizations through challenges. In many ways, it's when we're needed most.\nWith the right planning, strategy, and mindset, we can view disruption as an opening for innovation and differentiation. Previous roadblocks morph into opportunities that push our organizations forward, pressure testing both operational mechanisms and cultural connections so we emerge stronger on the other side.\n",

    "publishedAt": "9:52 AM EDT, Thu May 9, 2024",
    "content": "One man’s loss is another man’s gain, goes the saying – and as Boeing seems caught in a spiral of bad news, one aircraft manufacturer is quietly powering ahead.\nBrazilian manufacturer Embraer, which specializes in smaller narrow-body passenger jets, has been clocking up major announcements, and will soon comprise the entire regional fleet of American Airlines.\nAnd now, rumor has it that the company might be setting its sights even higher. A Wall Street Journal report last week suggested that Embraer – currently the world’s third largest aircraft manufacturer – was planning a new narrow-body jet that could “compete head-on” with the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 Max, which have cornered the global market.\nEmbraer has denied the reports. Yet the company’s star is certainly on the rise.\nOn May 2, Embraer delivered its 1,800th E-Jet aircraft: an E190-E2, to Royal Jordanian Airlines. Five days later, Singapore-based Scoot Airlines took delivery of its first Embraer: another E190-E2, the quietest and most fuel-efficient single-aisle jet on the market.\nEven in the US, where Boeing has traditionally ruled the roost, Embraer has been making waves.\nOn March 26, United announced a refurb of its Embraer E175 fleet to add larger overhead bins on its Skywest-operated planes. The move will increase storage space by 80%. Skywest is the world’s largest operator of Embraer’s E175 aircraft.\nThen there’s American Airlines, which announced the purchase of 90 E175 aircraft in March, making AA’s entire regional fleet Embraer by the end of the decade.\nThe love-in continued in April, when CEO Robert Isom praised the Brazilian company during a quarterly call. “The rest of the industry… can learn a lot from them,” he said, while also delivering a public rebuke to Boeing to, “Get your act together.”\nIt’s almost as if as Boeing’s star continues to fall, Embraer’s continues to rise. But can it go even bigger – and turn the “Big Two” of the skies into a “Big Three?”\nTo do so would require coming up with a new, larger aircraft to rival the 737MAX and the A320. At the moment, Embraer aircraft carry a maximum of 146 passengers, compared to the MAX’s minimum 172. It’d also mean scaling up – Embraer delivered 181 jets in 2023, of which 64 were commercial aircraft. Before the pandemic, it was delivering around 90 commercial aircraft per year.\nYet as Boeing struggles to regain public trust, experts say there’s room for someone else to grab a place in the market.\n“The door is open a little for a [Boeing] 737 replacement,” says Robert van der Linden, curator of air transportation at the National Air and Space Museum. Although he notes that it could close again “quickly,” and that debuting a new aircraft is a colossal task for manufacturers, he believes that Embraer might uniquely be capable of making headway in the aviation market – it already has the contacts and reputation.\nRodrigo Silva e Souza, Embraer’s VP of marketing who’s responsible for strategic planning, doesn’t deny that he’s looking at potential options, but says, “That’s my job.”\n“Designing, producing and delivering high-quality, highly reliable products is in our DNA, and I think that’s bringing some contrasts with what we’re seeing with other players,” he says, carefully.\nBut he tells CNN that aircraft take at least a decade to design and build, so while the current gap looks promising, they won’t be jumping in feet-first.\n“Designing an aircraft takes 10 years, and in 10 years from now the situation is completely different.\n“If someone had designed this before, they could be jumping in now, but you don’t decide to make a new aircraft and have it ready next year,” he says.\nSo could Embraer muscle its way to the top? It’s made it against the odds so far.\nFor an aircraft manufacturer with such a toehold in the US market, Embraer’s origins might come as a surprise.\nBased in São José dos Campos, in the state of São Paulo, the company was founded in 1969 by the Brazilian government – its name is a portmanteau of Empresa Brasileira de Aeronáutica (Aeronautics Corporation of Brazil) – on the back of the development of the Bandeirante, a twin-turboprop aircraft.\nInitially used for the Brazilian military, the Bandeirante entered commercial service in 1972. With 15-21 seats, it was aimed at “commuter companies,” says Alvaro Romero, a Chilean aviation historian.\nRelated article\nChina’s C919 passenger jet to make first commercial flight\nThe company was privatized in 1994, and went public on the stock market in 2000. By that time, says van der Linden, it had already cracked the US.\n“They found a very comfortable niche market for regional jets,” he says.\n“It was very wise not to compete directly with Boeing and Airbus. Try and break into an oligopoly and chances are you’re going to get squashed.\n“Regional jets carry anything from 35 to almost 150 passengers and Embraer grabbed hold of that market.”\nIn the regional market, Embraer’s primary competitor was Canada’s Bombardier, which sold its commercial manufacturing arm to Airbus in 2020.\nIn fact, Embraer nearly made a similar deal with Boeing in 2019, when the US giant signed up to take an 80% stake in the Brazilian company’s commercial division – before reneging on the deal in 2020. You could call it Embraer’s lucky escape.\nNow, says Silva e Souza, Embraer’s main rival is Airbus itself.\nSo how has Embraer succeeded where others have failed? For van der Linden, Brazil was far-sighted. “As early as the 1940s, the Brazilian government was interested in establishing aviation and aerospace manufacturing,” he says. Government backing meant that Embraer had money to produce quality planes from the outset. “It developed a very well-deserved reputation,” he says.\nFor aero historian Mario Overall, a member of the Latin American Aviation Historical Society, Embraer is an “exceptional” company. He puts that global success down to several factors, from its diverse portfolio (Embraer still makes military airplanes and private jets) to its designs, export strategy and outsourcing supply, keeping costs down. “Its versatility has enabled Embraer to cater to a wide range of customers,” he says. Yet he calls taking on Boeing a “daunting” process and doesn’t believe it’ll develop a larger narrowbody.\nWith major US carriers operating small planes on regional routes, Embraer’s focus on sub-200 passenger planes – its largest, the E195, has a maximum capacity of 146 seats – is a perfect fit for the US market. They’re also used on less-trafficked routes in Latin America and Europe, as well as at difficult airports. At London City, which requires a steep 5.5 degree approach for the short runway, 85% of the aircraft are Embraers.\nAnd while, by the numbers, AA and United are its top clients, Embraer’s biggest airline fan is perhaps LOT Polish Airlines, where 43 of its 75-strong fleet are Embraers (this week, it announced another three).\n“These aircraft have been instrumental in our strategy to expand our network, allowing us to confidently launch new routes, even to destinations with initially lower demand. The Embraer fleet’s reliability, efficiency, and passenger appeal make them indispensable,” says LOT spokesperson Krzysztof Moczulski.\nIt’s not just airlines; plenty of frequent flyers have a crush, too.\n“In Europe, it’s the best way to fly economy,” says Koen Berghuis of the 82-seater ERJ-175, which he flies on regularly with LOT.\n“You have so much legroom, shoulder room, and some airlines have really comfortable seating. You don’t feel like you’re in a sardine can, which I feel on the Boeing 737 MAX. But the 2-2 configuration is the main benefit,” says Berghuis, editor-in-chief of travel blog Paliparan.\nThat’s right – the dreaded middle seat simply doesn’t exist. In first class on American and United, Embraer goes one better – it’s a 1-2 configuration. The smaller jets even have 1-2 in economy, too.\nRelated article\nWhen is a car faster than a plane? When it’s electric\nTravel vlogger Paul Lucas actively seeks to fly Embraer.\n“It’s really pleasant to fly on – it has really big windows that mean loads of cabin light,” he says (van der Linden compares the windows of a bijou Embraer to those on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner).\n“They feel like mainline jets inside, but have the operational benefits of a regional jet,” Lucas says of Embraer’s E-jet range. “They probably should get more of a profile.”\nFor him, a key reason why Embraer doesn’t get the same hype as the Big Two is that it’s Brazilian.\n“In the US, Boeing is a flagship company – Americans were proud of it until recently. And Airbus is pan-European,” he says.\n“Then there’s Embraer.”\nAs Boeing spirals, is there a chance for Embraer to break through?\nSilva e Souza says that the company’s current focus is the Energia project, which aims to develop 30-seater hybrid-electric aircraft by 2030, slashing the aircraft carbon emissions by 30% (90% if using SAF). A hydrogen-fuel-cell version is planned for 2035, with a 50-seater scheduled for 2040.\nHe also predicts an untapped market for small, sustainable planes to replace long drives.\nAnd while he insists that the company is concentrating on “harvesting” following “10-15 years of very strong development” – he’s not denying that they’re eyeing all options.\nAt the Dubai Airshow in November, he hinted that the company was scanning markets such as the Middle East, where it says that only 16% of flights are full – meaning smaller aircraft could make certain routes more profitable. Meanwhile the company’s 2023 Market Outlook report suggests that “the future lies in the middle” – which Silva e Souza defines as 100-150 seats.\nCould that “middle” get a little bigger, though? The troubled Boeing MAX starts at 172 seats – not far off Embraer’s E2-195, which seats 146.\nThe only other potential competitor is Comac’s C919, currently only certified to operate in China. Silva e Souza believes that Chinese-made aircraft will make it into the global market, but “it’ll take a long time.”\nHe doesn’t deny that Embraer is monitoring the market, however. “We speak to investors. We keep looking: smaller, bigger, commercial, defense – for each we talk to partners who will help build the business case. But we’ve done nothing specifically on the [MAX rival].\n“We’re confident in our capabilities. But it’s very different taking decisions on the current situation for a product that will come 10 years from now.”\nIf they did take the plunge, they have an army of fans waiting to take flight.\n",

    "content": "Bishop Mark Seitz has seen countless immigrants come and go during his years of service in the southern border city of El Paso, telling Newsweek that challenging the policies and narratives of Texas Governor Greg Abbott and other officials is sometimes necessary to protect the most vulnerable.\nIn 2013, Pope Francis appointed Seitz as the bishop of El Paso, and during his decade-plus tenure, he has focused on migrant families and refugees, whether they settle in the city or pass through to their next destination. The Diocese of El Paso, which was instituted on March 3, 1914, covers about 26,700 square miles, its website says—including nine Texas counties, 56 parishes and 18 missions, serving a Catholic population of 686,000.\nAs the broader national immigration debate has hit a boiling point, the bishop has felt it imperative to speak out on migrants' behalf. He has criticized Abbott and other Texas lawmakers for attempting to expand the state's authority over immigration through legislative efforts—such as Senate Bill 4, which would allow law enforcement and the Texas National Guard to arrest, detain and deport migrants suspected of being in the country illegally. The legislation remains pending because of a lower-court ruling.\n\"I really try to frame whatever I say as policies and not persons,\" Seitz told Newsweek via phone. \"That's really the concern that we have, and we don't seek to make issues personal as such. But if it challenges a person, then fine.\"\nSeitz, who chairs the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' Committee on Migration, has been vocal about the placing of razor wire to deter migrants crossing the Rio Grande.\nIn March, he referred to such efforts as \"transparently political\" and part of a \"broader, brutal, historical project in Texas to criminalize and police people who migrate.\"\n\"People of faith have a duty to resist these racist projects,\" he added.\nSeitz said that while people will naturally have their own set of principles, sometimes the reason for differences is not understanding what is factually occurring, which requires speaking out.\nNewsweek has contacted Abbott's office for comment via email.\nSeitz said the church isn't arguing about the existence of borders or a country enforcing an orderly process. However, he added that the church should be telling certain \"actors\" who say they're motivated by their faith to identify the \"recognition of human dignity\" as a starting point in honest conversation.\n\"I live on the border. I work all the time with Border Patrol and other enforcement agencies and immigrants,\" the bishop said. \"I speak from that awareness as well. What are they experiencing? What are we going through on the border every day?\"\nHe said that lawmakers \"very often\" use isolated incidents that are \"replayed over and over and over\" to give outsiders an impression of what the situation on the 1,950-mile-long border between the U.S. and Mexico is like.\n\"There are claims of violence, especially given the high numbers [of illegal border crossings] in recent years,\" he said. \"I think occasions when anything violent happened are extremely rare.\"\n\"The truth is, immigrant communities—people who make them up—are much less likely to commit any kind of crime compared to groups born into the United States. We haven't in El Paso experienced an increase of crime in these years in general, and we haven't seen an increase in immigrants even though these people come with nothing,\" he added.\nAside from Abbott, Seitz has chastised Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.\nOn February 20, Paxton sued Annunciation House, a Catholic nongovernmental organization in El Paso, alleging it should have its operation license in the state revoked for facilitating illegal entry to the United States, harboring illegal migrants, human smuggling and operating a stash house.\nThe following month, a judge called into question Paxton's \"true motivation\" for going after an NGO that provides humanitarian and social services—adding that the lawsuit may have violated \"fair play\" without due process.\n\"Annunciation House is being completely mischaracterized,\" Seitz said. \"If there's any bulwark against human trafficking of these vulnerable immigrants, if there's anything to prevent child trafficking and the like, it's the existence of an NGO like Annunciation House.\"\nThe presence of the NGO, which has been part of the community for almost 50 years, also prevents street releases of unidentified migrants, the bishop said, adding, \"If we didn't have Annunciation House, we'd see human trafficking at levels we never imagined.\"\nSeitz's criticism has extended beyond conservative officials in his own state.\nHe said he was \"deeply disturbed\" following President Joe Biden's recent border order suspending asylum processing between ports of entry when numbers exceed 2,500 per day. The order, based on decades-old law, has already faced legal threats from groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union.\nThe order is a response to what Seitz describes as a nation with a \"crisis of conscience.\" He said that while the immigration system needed to be revamped, many migrants were being vilified when they just wanted to improve their lives.\n\"It's extremely damaging and destructive to them,\" Seitz said. \"It really harms them from becoming productive members of society. We're hurting ourselves a certain way if we don't allow a pathway to gain refuge.\"\n",

    "content": "Former President Donald Trump's social media company appears to be weathering storms on the stock market, with the stock price remaining steady despite concerns that short sellers would devalue it.\nRead more: The Best Stocks to Invest in Now\nThe price of shares in Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), which runs the Truth Social platform as its primary asset, has remained higher than lows it reached in April after the company made an effort to stop short selling, a practice that involves borrowing a stock whose price one thinks is going to fall, selling it on the open market, then buying the same stock back later for a cheaper price.\nTrump holds almost 60 percent of TMTG. When shareholders of Digital World Acquisition Corp., an existing shell company, agreed to merge with TMTG earlier this year—clearing the way for the former president's company to go public—its stock value declined after an initial boost.\nWhen the merged group debuted on the stock market on March 26, under the ticker DJT, shares initially surged above $78, closing its first day of trading at $57.99 and giving the company a valuation of $11 billion. The value of each share in the merged group reached $71.90 on March 27, before its profit and loss figures were released.\nThen, the company's share value declined. On April 17, Google Finance data showed the value of each share at $22.84. That was the lowest the share price had been since January 16, exactly three months earlier, when it was $22.35, meaning the share price was a little more than before it merged with Trump's Truth Social.\nOn April 15, Trump filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) meaning that, pending the SEC's approval, some investors will be able to sell their shares, with one analyst suggesting people sell their stakes in the company.\nIn an apparent effort to avoid this, on April 29, TMTG issued a press release highlighting steps shareholders could take to prevent brokerage firms lending their shares for the purpose of short selling. The release also included a sample email shareholders could send to brokers to opt-out of securities lending programs.\nCompany CEO Devin Nunes, a former Republican congressman from California, also sent a letter to stock market index Nasdaq's chief, Adena Friedman, raising concerns about short selling.\n\"DJT appears on Nasdaq's 'Reg SHO threshold list,' which is indicative of unlawful trading activity,\" the letter, published in an SEC filing on Friday, said. \"This is particularly troubling given that 'naked' short selling often entails sophisticated market participants profiting at the expense of retail investors.\"\nNaked shorting is a form of investing in which shares being bet against are never secured or borrowed. It is banned because it can artificially distort market supply and incite volatility.\nSince then, the value of the shares increased somewhat and, according to April 29 Google Finance data, was up to $41.54 a share.\nOn May 3, the latest available Google Finance data shows it is $48.68 a share. It has been a week since the stock was worth less than $45, showing the company's approach appears to be working.\nHowever, Todd Landman, a professor of political science at the School of Politics and International Relations at the University of Nottingham in the U.K., said the stock was still \"volatile.\"\n\"The stock value remains relatively volatile with its surge to USD $66.22 at the end of March, after which it dropped to USD $22.84, but has seen a steady climb since 16 April back up to USD $48.68 by 2 May,\" he said. \"It has thus not recovered to the value in late March and there remains the key question as to whether Mr. Trump will sell his shares in September, which could affect the share price.\"\nA TMTG spokesperson told Newsweek: \"We will take whatever actions are necessary to prevent our retail investors from being exploited.\"\n",

Tyson, 34, was arrested by University of Arkansas police on charges of driving while intoxicated, careless driving and improper turn/u-turn, according to Washington County Sheriff's Office records. He was later released on a $1,105 bond\nTyson is the great-grandson of the founder of the company, John W. Tyson. He has been the CFO of the company since 2022.\n\"We are aware that John Randal Tyson, Chief Financial Officer of Tyson Foods, was arrested for an alleged DWI.

    "content": "Following another defeat in the Super Bowl, once again at the hands of the Kansas City Chiefs, the San Francisco 49ers entered the offseason wondering what went wrong. San Francisco has been so close to getting itself back to the mountaintop, only to see everything crumble right before its eyes.\nThe 49ers changed quarterbacks and brought in more offensive weapons to counter the Chiefs, only for the same result to occur as did during their prior Super Bowl encounter. The 49ers' front office has taken a long look at where else the team could tweak its roster, bringing about rumors of San Francisco moving off one or both of its two-star wide receivers. Both Deebo Samuel and Brandon Aiyuk are looking for massive contract extensions, something that the 49ers will need to address at some point.\nWhile trade rumors swirled, 49ers general manager John Lynch fueled the fire by drafting wide receiver Ricky Pearsall out of the University of Florida in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft.\nLynch appeared on ESPN's \"The Pat McAfee Show\" and addressed the rumors that the 49ers may be looking to move off one of, or even both, receivers this offseason.\n\"I love our roster,\" Lynch said. \"I love the way it's comprised. As I said, we were right there. And we got to find a way to get just a little bit better. And I'm doing everything in my power to keep our roster together and that's my goal.\"\nHere are three intriguing possible landing spots for either Samuel or Aiyuk, if the 49ers do move on from them:\n1. Pittsburgh Steelers\nIf there is any club that needs to land a big-time wide receiver, it's the Pittsburgh Steelers. After trading away Diontae Johnson this offseason, the Steelers are left relying on George Pickens to be their top option. They did draft Roman Wilson out of Michigan, but relying on a rookie can be tough.\nIf Pittsburgh were to land either Samuel or Aiyuk, it could be a game-changer within the AFC North. Landing either one of them could vault the Steelers toward the top of the division, and would give presumed starting quarterback Russell Wilson some talent to work with. Don't sleep on Pittsburgh being aggressive here after a great offseason so far.\n2. Buffalo Bills\nAfter trading away Stefon Diggs and letting Gabe Davis walk, the Bills find themselves in a precarious spot at the wide receiver position. While the team did draft Keon Johnson and sign Chase Claypool, Buffalo could use a star.\nSomeone like Samuel or Aiyuk would help this offense thrive and give quarterback Josh Allen a true No. 1 option to throw too. Buffalo has been aggressive in the past in making trades, so there is no reason to think they won't be here.\n3. Washington Commanders\nAfter drafting No. 2 overall pick Jayden Daniels, Washington needs to surround the exciting young quarterback with weapons to throw the ball too. While they have Terry McLaurin, they could use another star next to him. Either Samuel or Aiyuk would do wonders for this Commanders offense and the team has all their draft picks for the next few years.\nSan Francisco could easily recoup some draft capital here and use Pearsall to fill the void. Washington makes a lot of sense but the 49ers may want to push for a trade to an AFC squad instead.\n",

    "content": "From the blooming azaleas of Augusta National to the breathtaking lighthouse at Turnberry in Scotland, golf is renowned for its natural beauty. The same cannot be said, however, for the sport’s primary mode of transport.\nBut one Danish company is on a mission to put the art in golf cart.\nCopenhagen-based Garia is the self-described “world’s first and only” luxury golf and leisure car brand (that’s car, not cart), whose aims to regenerate the traditional golf buggy have led to ambitions that lie far beyond the confines of the 18-hole course.\nSuch goals seemed a long drive away in 2005 when Anders Lynge, still in design school, met Soren Bak Hansen during an internship at a car company. A short while later, having spotted a gap in the market, the duo founded Garia.\n“When it came to the golf cart 18 years ago, they all looked the same – there weren’t any serious high-end products out there,” Lynge told CNN.\n“If you lived in a high-end community – paying hundreds of thousands of dollars of membership fees, a $10 million house, whatever you had – the whole lifestyle of these people, from their cars to their clothes, watches; everything was super personalized.\n“We thought it was strange that they all had the same type of golf cart … So the idea behind Garia was basically to say, ‘How can we make a product that fulfils the lifestyle of these people, that has the same sort of quality that they’re used to from every other product they surround themselves with?’\n“That really changed our focus to say, ‘Hey, let’s do that: the ultimate golf car.’”\nAchieving that aim was easier said than done when the team was effectively tasked with reinventing the wheel and – as Lynge remarked – an unattractive one at that.\nThere are several reasons for the uniformity of the traditional golf buggy, narrow and vertical in shape, Lynge explained. The universal requirement of having to fit onto golf courses and their various cart paths – needing to perform 180-degree turns in a cul-de-sac – limits design creativity.\n“It’s like trying to do a new bicycle or a new motorcycle,” Lynge said. “You’re so heavily constrained from a technical standpoint.\n“It’s the worst kind of shape you can have – it doesn’t look very dynamic. You want something that’s sort of Lamborghini-shaped – very low and wide – but the golf cart is the exact opposite.”\nYet solutions emerged: extending the wheelbase, enlarging the cabin, unprecedented 12-inch alloy wheels without hubcaps that replaced the traditional “deep dish” look, and a double wishbone front suspension – common in sports cars – to boost handling.\nGaria’s vehicles may look bigger and more “muscular” than the average golf cart, but the proportions are the same as any other standard buggy. This is simply a visual “trick” – and far from the only one.\nA storage box tucked behind the seat serves to lift the beltline, slashing cabin space to give it more of a car feel, while accent lines and wheels pushed out to the edges help ground the vehicle.\nLynge toyed extensively with positive and negative space, taking inspiration from Porsche’s 911 to use convex and concave shapes across the car. It makes warehouse storage a “nightmare,” but the visual payoffs are worth the trouble, Lynge says.\nIn fact, it is rare that any two Garias look exactly the same.\nUsing an online configurator inspired by Nike’s shoe customizer, prospective buyers can hand-pick almost every aspect of their vehicle; from body and roof color – 44 options and rising – to wheels and interior features like refrigerators and cup holders. There are millions of possible combinations, Lynge insists.\nGerman luxury car modification firm Mansory, which works with clients including Bentley and Lamborghini, provides a range of accessories and even a full carbon-fiber car.\nRelated article\n16-year-old amateur Kris Kim wows golf world by making cut on PGA Tour debut\nOther collaborations have included German Bugatti supplier Kussmaul, which Garia paired with to build a single, special edition chrome car capable of doing 0 to 40 kilometers per hour (25 miles per hour) in less than two seconds.\nAnother involved Mercedes, whom Lynge first made contact with after winning a competition run by the car giant to design a golf cart. Lynge took the prize ceremony event as an opportunity to pitch a dream that would be realized in 2016 – a Garia golf car inspired by Mercedes-Benz Style.\nRetailing at just under €80,000 ($86,000), the fully carbon-fiber car had twice the battery life and twice the power of a typical Garia, topping out at speeds of 69 kilometers per hour (43 miles per hour).\n“Really expensive … super exclusive, but also the coolest golf car you’ll ever see,” Lynge said.\nIts scarcity means only a select few will have been seen on European roads.\nMaking street legal models was always the plan for Garia, but achieving certification is no easy feat. Extensive – and therefore expensive – safety and crash testing is required to gain road-status, and requirements differ across regions.\nWhile Europe allows for greater speeds, the US employs a strict 40 kilometers per hour (25 miles per hour) legal limit on such vehicles. But that did not discourage Lynge, who saw the prevalence of golf communities in the US as a potentially lucrative market for Garia. The company was sold by the Lars Larsen Group to American golf and utility giant Club Car in 2022.\nThe base version of Garia’s two-seater golf car – without any customization or additional features – has a manufacturer suggested retail price of €14,939 ($16,100), with the four-seater edition starting from €20,189 ($21,770). The street legal variants for both Europe and the US come in at €18,959 ($20,440) for the two-seat model and rise to €21,219 ($22,880) for four seats.\n“We very much felt that these cars are so fun to drive and they are fun to interact with,” Lynge said. “I don’t know the exact percentage, but a great part of our cars are also bought by people who don’t play golf. They are just in a holiday house.”\nAs he looks to the future, Lynges envisions Garia branching out of golf and into the leisure space, becoming “more-and-more car-like” with each passing year, making vehicles suited to urban mobility.\n“If you drive around London, how fast do you even need to go? Forty-three miles per hour is plenty of opportunity, right? There is some weird sort of space there as the market changes into full electric where everything is sort of up in the air,” he said.\n“I don’t know where we’re going to land, but I feel like we have some interesting lessons with us in this journey we’ve been on that puts us in a good position to do mobility, maybe in a wider sense, than just golf.”\n",

These developments suggest that Pyongyang is determined to open the getaway soon, although the exact date remains unknown.\nConstruction at Wonsan-Kalma, on the eastern side of the Korean peninsula about four hours from Pyongyang, started in 2018 with an initial completion target of 2020. The project has faced numerous setbacks, including delays caused by the pandemic​​.\nBut things seem to be back on track with repaving work completed after it began in the first week of May, along with advanced stages of construction visible throughout the resort, according to an analysis of before-and-after satellite photos. Beach chairs have even been set up in the central area.\nThe successful completion and operation of the resort could be a significant step toward achieving Kim Jong-un's vision of boosting the nation's tourism sector, which is tightly controlled.\nDuring its construction phase, Wonsan-Kalma has only hosted a limited number of visitors, including a media crew from Russia earlier this year. Russian tour companies have been notified about the imminent opening, but specific details remain scarce.\nThe progress on the complex aligns with recent news related to tourism efforts in North Korea. In March, Pyongyang announced that a group of Russian tourists went on a ski trip, becoming the first international visitors since the borders closed in January 2020.\nTwo months later, a Russian train carrying tourists departed for North Korea for the first time in four years, according to the Russian customs service, less than a month after a local governor announced the resumption of rail traffic in mid-May.\nThe expanding ties between North Korea and Russia come as they are locked in separate confrontations with the U.S. and its allies.\nPreparations are already underway in Pyongyang for Russian President Vladimir Putin's upcoming visit, which marks his first trip to North Korea since 2000. Moscow has suggested the visit will be soon, but neither side has announced visit dates.\nThe visit is part of a broader effort to strengthen ties between the two nations, particularly in light of increased military cooperation amid Russia's conflict with Ukraine. Putin is expected to visit Vietnam from June 19 to 20 and may visit North Korea on the same trip.\nIf the resort on Wonsan-Kalma intends to market itself to domestic travelers, a stay would need to be cheap — the average salary in North Korea, typically controlled by Kim's autocratic government, translates to about $3 dollars per month.\n",

    "content": "The United Nations’ top court struck down a demand by Nicaragua that Germany immediately halt its arms exports to Israel on Tuesday, saying it cannot issue emergency measures against Berlin under the current circumstances.\n“The court, by 15 votes to 1, finds that the circumstances as they present themselves to the court are not such as to require the exercise of its power under article 41 of the statute to indicate provisional measures,” Judge Nawaf Salam, president of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), said at The Hague in the Netherlands on Tuesday.\nHowever, the court also rejected Germany’s demand to strike the lawsuit from its list, meaning the case will now move on. The ruling on Tuesday only concerned whether or not Berlin should be ordered to immediately stop selling arms to Israel.\nReading the ruling, Salam said the court was “concerned about the catastrophic living conditions of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, including prolonged deprivation of food and basic necessities.”\nThe case against Germany was brought by Nicaragua. A long-time supporter of the Palestinian cause, the Central American country accused Germany of violating its obligations as a signatory of the Genocide Convention through its political, financial and military support for Israel, and by suspending funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA).\nGermany suspended the funding in January amid allegations that 12 of the UN agency’s employees were involved in the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7. It has since reinstated it.\nGermany “welcomed the ICJ ruling” according to a statement posted by the German Foreign Ministry on X shortly after the announcement. In the statement, the ministry added that “Germany is not a party in the conflict in the Middle East” and added: “to the contrary, Germany is working day and night for a two-state solution.”\nIsrael was not a party to the case, but the ruling on Tuesday comes as the ICJ is hearing a separate case brought against Israel by South Africa. In January, the court issued an interim ruling ordering Israel to prevent genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, but stopped short of calling for Israel to suspend its military campaign, as South Africa had requested. The ICJ is still considering whether Israel is guilty of violating the Genocide Convention, a legal process that could take years.\nThis story has been updated.\nCNN’s Abel Alvarado and Tamar Michaelis contributed reporting.\n",

    "content": "A third world war has \"crept up unnoticed,\" a prominent Russian newspaper has said, after Russian President Vladimir Putin warned long-range strikes launched into Russia from Ukraine would pull NATO countries closer to direct confrontation with Moscow.\nMore than two years of full-scale fighting in Ukraine has brought the possibility of another global conflict to the fore. NATO countries are eager to tamp down on the possibility of the violence spreading beyond the country's borders. When providing military aid and weapons to Ukraine they have been clear they are assisting Kyiv's defense against Moscow's forces, not being party to the war.\nHowever, this hasn't prevented the hostilities from becoming Europe's largest armed conflict since World War II.\nNATO nations have increasingly come out in favor of permitting Ukraine to use Western-supplied weapons systems to strike into internationally-recognized Russian territory. The U.S., the most vocal opponent of Western weapons reaching beyond Ukraine's borders, has indicated this week it may \"adapt and adjust\" its policies, but has not yet lifted its restrictions on Kyiv.\nEarlier this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin said NATO countries, \"especially the ones based in Europe, particularly in small European countries, should be fully aware of what is at stake\" by allowing Ukraine to strike inside Russia with donated weapons.\n\"They should keep in mind that theirs are small and densely populated countries, which is a factor to reckon with before they start talking about striking deep into the Russian territory,\" the Russian leader said. \"This constant escalation can lead to serious consequences.\"\n\"It is another step toward a serious conflict in Europe, toward a global conflict,\" Putin said, adding long-range strikes from Ukraine were impossible without NATO-facilitated space reconnaissance.\nRussia's leader issued a \"completely unambiguous ultimatum\" with his remarks, a writer for Russia's Moskovskij Komsomolets daily newspaper claimed, adding they hoped Western countries would \"not think that he is bluffing.\" The piece also appeared on the front page of the newspaper's print edition.\nShortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Kyiv warned that, should Ukraine fall to Russian forces, other nations in Europe will be next on Russia's hit list in what would be a wider European war.\n\"If Ukraine will not stand, Europe will not stand,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said. \"If we will fall, you will fall.\"\nEarlier this year, Putin said \"everything is possible\" when discussing whether a wider war could break out between Russia and Western countries backing Ukraine. The globe is \"one step away from a full-scale World War III,\" Putin said in mid-March.\nThe previous month, Belarus' leader Alexander Lukashenko—one of Putin's most steadfast allies—warned that the world \"has again come to the brink of the abyss.\"\n\"There are grounds for concern\" about a third world war, he added.\n",

From a man's point of view.\"\nLora responded: \"Nah. Nah. I don't care.\"\nThe man, who is off-camera, said sarcastically: \"That's a good attitude,\" to which she replied: \"That's why I'm wearing it. But thanks for your input.\"\nThere has been a huge response to the video, which you can watch here, and Lora told Newsweek the interaction made her \"really angry.\"\n\"We'd just turned on the mic to do a sound check for some street interviews and then it happened,\" she said.\n\"It made me really angry as I was minding my own business and he just thought he could come and say that to me.

Nah.

We need to stick together and lift each other up rather than bring each other down.\"\nSharing some advice, she urged people to \"stay safe and always be careful.\"\n\"Keep your phones on you and make sure people know where you are if you're alone.

    "content": "An asteroid floating in our solar system has been discovered to have a very weird and unique double moon—and it might just change the way we think about how planets form.\nThe asteroid—officially titled \"Dinkinesh\" but nicknamed \"Dinky\"—was found to have a tiny moon orbiting it when NASA's Lucy spacecraft flew past it in November 2023. However, subsequent data revealed that the moon is actually two moons stuck together, marking the first time such a system has been observed around an asteroid.\nNow, a new paper in the journal Nature has revealed how this moon—known as a contact binary—may have formed, shedding light on how celestial bodies interact.\n\"Our ultimate goal is to understand the formation of celestial bodies,\" study co-author Jessica Sunshine, a professor of astronomy at the University of Maryland, said in a statement. \"How do planets form? How was Earth formed? We know that big planets are formed by smaller bodies, so studying these little asteroids lets us see how materials behave and interact on a smaller scale. With Dinky and the other asteroids we're flying by, we're laying the groundwork for understanding how planets are made.\"\nDinkinesh is situated in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and measures about 2,360 feet across. As Lucy approached the asteroid, it saw that its moon—named Selam—was actually two small moons joined together. Each of these two moons were around the same size at about 700 feet across, which is a rare trait among the other scant contact binaries we have seen in our solar system.\nSelam takes around 52.5 hours to orbit Dinkinesh, with an incredibly short distance of just under 2 miles between the two. The researchers estimate that Dinkinesh has a mass of about 16 times that of Selam.\n\"There's a lot more complexity in these small bodies than we originally thought,\" said Sunshine. \"With the additional observations taken by the spacecraft, we were able to better analyze features such as Dinkinesh's rotation speed and Selam's orbit pattern. We also have a better understanding of what materials they're possibly made of, bringing us a step closer to learning just how terrestrial bodies are created.\"\nThe Lucy spacecraft's high-resolution imaging system, L'LORRI, captured detailed images of Dinkinesh and Selam, revealing a trough and a ridge on Dinkinesh's surface. These features suggest that a portion of Dinkinesh's material was ejected into space due to its fast rotation and the bright glare of the sun.\nThe researchers theorize that this ejecta could possibly have led to the formation of Selam, with the rest showering back down onto the asteroid to form the ridges seen on the surface of Dinkinesh.\nIn the paper, the researchers note that this discovery offers new insights into the formation and structural dynamics of celestial bodies, challenging current theories and opening up new avenues for research into how systems like Dinkinesh's form and evolve.\n\"One of the things that's critical to understanding how planets like Earth got here is understanding how objects behave when they hit each other, and to understand that we need to understand their strength,\" co-author Hal Levison, a researcher at Southwest Research Institute, Boulder, Colorado, said in a statement.\n\"Basically, the planets formed when [smaller objects like asteroids] orbiting the sun ran into each other. Whether objects break apart when they hit or stick together has a lot to do with their strength and internal structure.\"\nThe findings also have potential for comparative studies with the asteroid Didymos and its companion, which was also explored by NASA's DART mission. Despite being in different regions—Dinkinesh in the main asteroid belt and Didymos near Earth—both systems exhibit striking similarities.\n\"I'm personally very excited to compare the Didymos binary system with this one, especially as they appear to share many similarities such as size, general shape and possibly composition despite being in totally different parts of the solar system,\" Sunshine said.\n\"The Didymos binary system is located in a near-Earth environment while the Dinkinesh system is located much farther away from Earth in the main asteroid belt,\" she said. \"They have very different features but we think they may have undergone similar processes to become what we know of them today.\"\nThe Lucy mission, launched in October 2021, aims to explore 11 asteroids over its 12-year journey, focusing primarily on the Trojan asteroids orbiting near Jupiter. Dinkinesh was a warm-up target added to the mission's schedule, demonstrating the spacecraft's capabilities and setting the stage for more ambitious encounters in the future. After a gravity-assist flyby of Earth in December 2024, Lucy will head towards another main belt asteroid, Donaldjohanson in 2025, before moving on to the Trojan asteroids in 2027.\n",

Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee in the November presidential election, denies that he had sexual encounters with Daniels and pled not guilty to all 34 felony counts in the case brought by Bragg. On Thursday afternoon, a jury of 12 found Trump guilty on all counts.\nNewsweek senior reporter Katherine Fung was also inside the courtroom throughout the trial.\nIn his news conference, Bragg said, \"First and foremost, I want to thank the jury for its service. Jurors perform a fundamental civic duty. Their service is literally the cornerstone of our judicial system.\"\nContinuing, \"We should all be thankful for the careful attention that this jury paid to the evidence and the law and their time and commitment over these past several weeks.\" Bragg then recapped the trial, noting the evidence presented to the jury. He also thanked his prosecution team, calling them \"model public servants.\"\nBragg also said when answering a question from the media in part, \"The only voice that matters is the voice of the jury, and the jury has spoken.\"\nNewsweek has reached out to Donald Trump's campaign and the Manhattan District Attorney's Office via email Thursday night for additional comment.\nAfter the verdict was reached, Bragg took to X, formerly Twitter, saying, \"Today, a jury found Donald J. Trump GUILTY on ALL 34 felony counts.\" In a statement posted online Bragg also said in part, \"In Manhattan, we follow the facts without fear or favor and have a solemn responsibility to ensure equal justice under the law regardless of the background, wealth or power of the accused. The integrity of our judicial system depends on upholding that principle.\"\nPalm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg told Newsweek Thursday night, \"Bragg's prosecutors put on an excellent case by building a firewall around Michael Cohen with lots of corroboration. The defense struggled to provide a competing theory that could pass the smell test. It just wasn't plausible that Michael Cohen would go rogue and shell out $130,000 to protect his boss without Trump knowing or reimbursing him for it.\"\nFormer US Attorney and legal analyst Barbara McQuade also told Newsweek, \"The prosecution presented a strong case, and it is gratifying to see a jury confirm that no one is more powerful than the rule of law.\"\nMcQuade added: \"I would be surprised to see Donald Trump receive a custodial prison sentence in this case, in light of his lack of a criminal history in a non-violent offense, but now that he has some criminal history, a custodial sentence becomes more likely for any subsequent conviction.\"\nMeanwhile, Trump supporters took to social media to condemn the verdict. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican said on X, \"I'll be voting for President Trump on November 5th whether he is a free man or a prisoner of the Biden regime. My support for President Trump has never been stronger! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\nDonald Trump Jr. also posted to X saying, \"Guilty on all counts. The Democrats have succeeded in their years long attempt to turn America into a third-world sh******. November 5 is our last chance to save it.\"\nUpdate 11:05 p.m. ET 5/30/24: This story was updated with Barbara McQuade's comment.\n",

    "content": "The legal drama involving Scottie Scheffler, currently the top-ranked golfer globally, concluded recently with the dropping of all criminal charges against him. The charges stemmed from a misunderstanding outside the PGA Championship venue on May 17. This week, Jefferson County Attorney Mike O'Connell announced the decision, pointing to insufficient evidence to support the charges initially leveled against Scheffler.\nThis development is integral not only for Scheffler but also for the broader golfing community. It dispels the cloud of legal uncertainty that had been hovering over one of the sport's premier figures, ensuring his ability to continue in the sport undistracted. The incident, which involved a brief physical confrontation with Officer Bryan Gillis, had led to serious charges of second-degree assault. These charges could have had severe repercussions for Scheffler's career and reputation had they proceeded.\nThe confrontation took place in a traffic jam caused by a separate tragic incident where a man was fatally run over earlier that day. According to authorities, Gillis alleged that during the chaos, Scheffler's vehicle accelerated, contacting him and resulting in minor injuries. However, dashcam and other surveillance footage, supported by eyewitness accounts, contradicted these claims, leading to the eventual dismissal of the charges.\nScottie Scheffler reacted to the resolution of the case by expressing his respect for police officers and his desire to move on from the incident, as quoted by ESPN.\n\"I hold no ill will toward Officer [Bryan] Gillis. I wish to put this incident behind me and move on, and I hope he will do the same. Police officers have a difficult job and I hold them in high regard. This was a severe miscommunication in a chaotic situation,\" Scheffler stated.\nHe also made a point to remember the real victim of the day:\n\"I appreciate the support during the past two weeks and want to again encourage everyone to remember the real tragedy of May 17. My thoughts and prayers continue to be with John Mills and his family, and I hope to personally offer my condolences now that the case is over.\"\nJefferson County Attorney Mike O'Connell elaborated on the decision to drop the charges, stating:\n\"Based upon the totality of the evidence, my office cannot move forward in the prosecution of the charges filed against Mr. Scheffler. Mr. Scheffler's characterization that this was a 'big misunderstanding' is corroborated by the evidence.\n\"The evidence we reviewed supports the conclusion that Detective Gillis was concerned for public safety at the scene when he initiated contact with Mr. Scheffler. However, Mr. Scheffler's actions and the evidence surrounding their exchange during this misunderstanding do not satisfy the elements of any criminal offenses.\"\nWith legal distractions set aside, Scheffler plans to refocus entirely on his golfing career, with significant tournaments like the Memorial Tournament in Ohio and the U.S. Open in North Carolina on his upcoming schedule. Meanwhile, the Louisville Metro Police Department, criticized for the handling of this situation, particularly the absence of bodycam footage from Officer Gillis, may face internal reviews and possible adjustments in policy.\n",

    "publishedAt": "May 30, 2024 at 11:23 AM EDT",
    "content": "Donald Trump holds a substantial lead over Joe Biden among independent voters ahead of the presidential election in November, according to a new poll.\nThe NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist National survey of 1,122 registered voters nationwide found that Trump secured 54 percent of the vote among independent voters compared to 42 percent for Biden in a head-to-head race, with four percent undecided. The poll was conducted between May 21-23 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.\nThe findings showed Trump with even higher support among independent male voters at 56 percent compared to Biden's 39 percent, with five percent undecided. This contrasts with a much closer race among independent women voters, where Trump only led by 50 percent to Biden's 47 percent, with 3 percent undecided.\nThe survey showed that Trump held an even more substantial lead over Biden among independents in a five-way race that included independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr., independent Cornel West, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein.\nThe findings showed that Trump secured 44 percent of independent voters in the five-way race, compared to 28 percent for Biden, 17 percent for RFK Jr., 3 percent for West, and 4 percent for Stein, with another 4 percent undecided.\nOnce again, Trump performed more strongly among independent men in a five-way race, securing 45 percent of the vote to Biden's 29 percent. Among independent women, Trump secured 41 percent to Biden's 28 percent.\nNewsweek has contacted the Trump and Biden campaigns for comment outside of normal working hours.\nDespite the findings among independents, the data shows that the race remains very tight between Biden and Trump overall. In a head-to-head race, Biden leads among registered voters on 50 percent to Trump's 48 percent, with two percent undecided. The findings remain unchanged from a poll conducted in early May.\nTrump has, however, closed the gap on Biden in a five-way race, securing 44 percent of the vote to Biden's 40 percent, with RFK Jr. receiving 8 percent, West getting 2 percent, Stein getting 3 percent and another 3 percent undecided. This is a change from the start of May when Trump and Biden were both tied on 42 percent.\nIndependents are a critical voting block for both Biden and Trump to win over ahead of the November election, which could be determined by close votes in just a handful of key battleground states. Small swings in independent voters could determine whether these states are won by either candidate.\nIn 2020, Biden won Georgia and its 16 electoral college votes by less than 12,000 votes or 0.23 percent of overall votes cast in the state. Biden also won Arizona by less than 10,500 votes in 2020, or 0.31 percent of voters in the state.\nTrump has recently targeted independents with a speech to the Libertarian Party's national convention last week. Trump faced boos and hecklers at multiple points during his address and ultimately received only 0.65 percent of the vote for the party's presidential nominee.\nThe Libertarian Party, which was formed in 1971 and supports civil liberties and capitalism free from government supervision, is the third-largest American political party by voter registration but does not have a great deal of influence in American politics. It typically garners around 3 percent of the national vote and has few elected officials.\n",

    "content": "Despite significant increases in Seattle's millionaire population, the city is facing bankruptcy in several key spending areas, including education.\nAccording to data from wealth management firm Henley & Partners, Seattle's millionaire population increased by 3,700 in 2023, which also included a handful of centimillionaires (with a value over $100 million) and one new billionaire.\nThe analysis placed Seattle as the 23rd richest city in the world and the seventh-richest in America last year. New York ranked as the richest, with 349,500 millionaires, 744 centimillionaires and 60 billionaires, followed by The Bay Area, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston and Dallas. Rounding out the top ten were Boston, Miami and Austin.\nDespite the continued influx of wealth, Seattle is still struggling for resources.\nThe Seattle City Council's 5-year budget review revealed that despite a budget increase of 29% from 2019 to 2024, the city faces a projected $240 million budget deficit in 2025.\nThe Council's review highlights spending during the COVID-19 pandemic as the main reason for the deficit, along with a significant decrease in tax revenue.\nSimilarly, the Seattle public education system faces a similarly large deficit of at least $100 million, with the Seattle Public Schools board accepting that the organization \"is facing a significant budget deficit\" in their budget development report for the coming fiscal year.\nSeattle has seen a dramatic rise in wealth among its residents over the past decade. The number of millionaires in Seattle grew 72% from 2013 to 2023, reaching an estimated 54,200. The city is now home to 130 centimillionaires and 11 billionaires. Despite this surge in wealth, the city's financial challenges remain stark. The new wealth has not translated into increased tax revenues sufficient to cover rising public expenditures​\nFollowing the review's findings, the Seattle City Council pledged that \"our goal is to provide a higher level of services to Seattleites with the same amount of your tax dollars\".\nThe Seattle City Council didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Newsweek via email.\nHenley & Partners CEO Juerg Steffen attributed the growth in wealthy individuals to strong financial markets and advancements in technology. \"Rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, robotics, and blockchain technology have provided new opportunities for wealth creation and accumulation,\" Steffen said in a press release.\nDespite these advancements, the city's budget woes continue. The council is considering various measures, including detailed departmental budget reviews and potential tax increases to address the deficit​.\nSeattle is home to tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft, as well as other big-name brands such as Starbucks, Nordstrom and Expedia.\n",

    "content": "Editor’s Note: Allison Hope’s writing has been featured in The New Yorker, The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, Slate and elsewhere. The views expressed here are her own. Read more opinion on CNN.\nLesbian Visibility Week, celebrated each year at the end of April, was first observed in California in 1990 and is marked around the world and in lesbian living rooms across America — including mine.\nHaving been rendered largely invisible in the past, lesbians today have reason to celebrate our visibility. But in the past, being “out of view” of straight society was both a blessing and a curse.\nOne of the most infamously quoted lines cited in the Bible to condemn LGBTQ people is found in the book of Leviticus 18:22 — Old Testament scripture embraced by some who insist it should govern how “good Christians”  live.\nThe New King James Version of the verse proclaims, “You shall not lie with a male as with a woman. It is an abomination.”\nIt says nothing about women not sleeping with women. I’d like to think that God liked lesbians. However, the truth is most likely that lesbian invisibility has been compounded by the long history of misogyny and the absence of women from the seat of power. We were twice rendered irrelevant.\nNot that invisibility only has downsides. Many laws have criminalized gay men but not women, leaving us in slightly safer territory. Lesbians also have been largely exempted from some of the worst forms of discrimination, at least the kinds enshrined in law.\nSingapore’s draconian ban on gay sex, for example, which was repealed in 2022, only prohibited sex between men, with no mention of women. Gay men are also more likely to be victims of hate crimes and violence. Being invisible means we’re less likely to get caught in the crosshairs of hateful legislation aimed only at us.\nRelated article\nOpinion: There’s no compassion, humanity or Christianity in this statement from the Archdiocese of New York\nNone of that means, however, that we’ve fully escaped society’s homophobic vitriol and violence. Lesbians have long been subjected to the same shades of hate, stereotyping and subjugation that other LGBTQ people have long endured.\nWe’ve been depicted as murderers or the murdered in movies and books, the butt of jokes or stock characters, expendable characters or invisible ones. We’ve quietly endured straight marriages we thought we had to pursue and lost true loves to heteronormative rules gay people thought they needed to play by. We’ve long been forced into the role of childless aunt in our communities, or described euphemistically as the one who lives with her long-term “friend.” We’ve been expected to avoid injuring fragile male egos but still be able to open jars or fix leaky faucets.\nIn the worst cases, we’ve been victims and survivors of “corrective” rape, murder, abuse, harassment and banishment by our families and communities. Gay men might be criminalized, but gay women have long been targeted, sometimes in heinous ways that fly under the radar of the law, and which go unprosecuted.\nStill, lesbians have quietly been forming families and operating under the radar for a long time. It’s easier, after all, to read two lesbians with a child as aunts or sisters than two men with a child. We have side-stepped some of society’s worst condemnations.\nAs activists, lesbians were key advocates during the AIDS crisis, both in caring for our dying gay male chosen family members and demanding federal support for treatment options. Lesbians were also critical but sometimes unacknowledged players in advancing the Second Wave Feminist movement and advocating on the national stage. Yet, when it came time to support equal rights for lesbians, or even to raise the needs of lesbians in HIV/AIDS advocacy, both groups that we had helped for the most part failed to step up for us.\nIn spite of the challenges we’ve faced, or perhaps because of them, we celebrate our fabulous, lesbian selves. Some studies have shown that we have more satisfying sex than do our straight, cisgender peers and we earn nine percent more on average, possibly because of the reduced need for childcare duties and the higher-wage occupations pursued by lesbians.\nRelated article\nHow to love yourself this Galentine’s Day\nWe inhabit, in my view, the best parts of femininity and masculinity. We are vocal allies for our gay brothers, and our trans family and friends (minus the TERFS, dubbed feminists who don’t support trans people). I can both throw a football with my child and cuddle them to my bosom with pure maternal zeal. I can make love to a woman and watch silly rom coms with her, too. My wife is both my soulmate and my best friend. It feels like a tremendous gift I’ve been bestowed to be a lesbian.\nOver the years, lesbians have gained visibility and mainstream media has introduced more nuanced and accurate depictions of who we are and the diversity within the lesbian community. TV shows like “The L-Word” broke barriers. Its runaway success came on the heels of more niche media that paved the path, such as “Dyke TV” in the 1990s — a public access news channel that aired weekly in dozens of markets across the US.\nToday, there are more than a handful of movies and shows that feature recurring lesbian characters that are multi-dimensional and where being a lesbian is an aspect of their persona, rather than a plot device. Lesbians have welcomed A-listers out of the closet, including Jodie Foster, Lily Tomlin and Kate McKinnon, and have elevated formerly “niche” lesbian performers into mainstream roles, like Lea DeLaria and Wanda Sykes.\nThere is also an interesting trend of lesbian bars, which have long been critical gathering spaces for lesbians. For a while many were on the verge of extinction but now they’re making a comeback as new watering holes owned by and catering to lesbians spring up around the US. We’re getting married, having kids and assimilating into the historically hostile — but now more welcoming — cishet (heterosexual and not transgender) suburbs.\nGuilty as charged.\nMany of us are also expressing our sexuality and gender in more expansive ways. When I came out a generation ago, you were either cisgender (identifying with the gender assigned at birth), gay or a lesbian. Now, many are identifying as transgender, nonbinary, pansexual or a proliferation of other gender and sexual identities.\n\nWe think about lesbians as connected to gender, but so many, me included, feel more fluid. I don’t fit into the gender binary, but “lesbian” has also been the word that most closely describes me. Lesbian is not just a personal identity; it’s a political one. In that sense, I am very much a lesbian. A proud lesbian. A big dyke, to be more exact.\nVisibility matters. Seeing yourself reflected in leaders and stars and role models provides a level of psychological safety that is critical to feeling like a person who can walk through the world with their head held high, like our lives matter.\nOn this Lesbian Visibility Week, I am grateful both to be seen and to slip quietly under the radar, unnoticed. Nothing to see here, culture warriors. Just a slightly butch, pragmatic lesbian over here, completing mundane tasks and retiring to the couch with my wife to watch something sensible on TV.\n",

    "content": "Xi Jinping may have started his recent European trip by fielding tough questions in France about trade and Russia’s war in Ukraine, but the Chinese leader ended the sojourn late last week by projecting a stark message: that despite frictions with much of the continent, China still has fans in some European capitals.\nBeijing’s pulling power was on show in Belgrade and Budapest, where streets were festooned with Chinese flags. As Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan touched down at both cities’ airports, folk dancers performed on the tarmac and, in contrast to the subdued welcome the couple received in Paris, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban were on hand to greet them.\nChinese state media played up the warm diplomacy, with headlines proclaiming China’s “ironclad” bond with Serbia and “golden friendship” with Hungary. Both countries, major recipients of Chinese investment, announced upgrades of their relations with China during the visits – a symbolic win for Xi that analysts say could play a role softening European policy on China in fraught areas such as trade, security and human rights.\nBut in the rest of Europe, the red-carpet welcome afforded Xi by Vucic and Orban – both widely seen as illiberal and Russia-friendly – may not play as well, analysts say, and emphasizes the shrinking number of European capitals where Xi would meet such a warm embrace.\nChina-Europe relations have been frayed by the European Union’s growing list of economic grievances with China, which could yet spiral into a full-blown trade war. Also in the mix are suspicions across Europe about Beijing’s global ambitions and influence, especially over its support for Russia – including allegations it is supplying dual-use parts which help the Kremlin’s war against Ukraine.\nMaking his first visit to Europe in five years, Xi was pressed on these issues early last week by French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Both are sure to closely watch any summit between Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin in China, expected to happen soon.\nIn Paris, Xi stressed that China was playing no role other than “contributing to reaching peace” in Ukraine, and denied there was industrial “overcapacity” in China flooding the European market.\nSuch tensions vanished when Xi met Vucic and Orban.\nHis visits to Serbia and Hungary “send a very good message to a Chinese (domestic) audience that ‘we have close friends in Europe… Hungary and Serbia are real friends that we can do business with,’” said Philippe Le Corre, a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis, speaking at an event hosted by the center as Xi’s tour got underway last week.\nBut the countries’ inclusion in his itinerary was “embarrassing” for Paris, because both Orban and Vucic attended the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing last October alongside Putin, Le Corre added.\nXi’s visits to Serbia and Hungary helped him toward another goal – chipping away at a world order he sees as dominated by the United States.\nWith the inking of a joint statement, Serbia’s Vucic became the first European leader to commit to joining China in building a “community with a shared future.” The loosely formulated concept calls for a collaboration on shared interests, suggesting countries shouldn’t interact based on alliances, or be judged on their domestic politics and human rights record.\n“That is the highest level of cooperation of two countries and I am proud that as a president of Serbia I had an opportunity to sign that declaration with President Xi,” Vucic said Wednesday of the accord, which came alongside a free-trade agreement and other pledges from Xi on expanding agricultural imports and direct flights.\nXi also marketed a shared worldview during his meeting with Orban in Hungary, which is a member of both the EU and NATO. Orban, whose increasingly authoritarian rule has raised alarm within the EU, defied mounting concerns within both blocs to upgrade his country’s relations to an “all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership.”\nRelated card\nChina has a sweeping vision to reshape the world – and countries are listening\nAs well as being another symbolic win for Xi, this could encourage Orban to push back against efforts within the EU to “derisk” supply chains and slap tariffs on Chinese goods, analysts say. Speaking in Budapest Thursday alongside Orban, Xi appeared to allude to that, saying he hoped Hungary would use its rotating EU presidency beginning in July to “promote the stable and healthy development of China-EU relations.”\nThe two leaders also signed some 18 cooperation agreements, which Orban said covered sectors such as railways, IT, and nuclear energy. Xi declared the two countries would “deepen economic, trade, investment, and financial cooperation” and advance “key projects,” including the Budapest-Belgrade railway.\nBoth Serbia and Hungary are already key destinations for Chinese investment, with Hungary emerging as an increasingly important production hub in Europe for Chinese automotive suppliers including electric vehicle (EV) makers. In France earlier this week, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told journalists that Chinese company BYD was “welcome” to open a factory in France; but the EV giant appears to have already chosen its first foothold for car production in Europe, pledging late last year to open a plant in Hungary.\nBeijing may also be hoping other countries on the continent take note, with analysts saying all this plays into Xi’s efforts to frame parts of Europe as benefiting from clearheaded views on China, versus others who are mimicking American efforts to contain it.\n“Being close to these countries fits China’s domestic narrative that there are ‘smart countries’ in Europe who really understand China and do not support the United States – and China is working with these countries for the good of Europe,” said Liu Dongshu, an assistant professor of public and international affairs at Hong Kong’s City University.\nBut Xi’s itinerary also underscores his limitations within Europe, others say, including in Central and Eastern Europe where Beijing previously made extensive efforts to deepen connections and win goodwill, including through Xi’s flagship Belt and Road infrastructure drive.\nA Chinese mechanism to bolster relations with 16 Central and Eastern European nations has slowly lost support, in part because investments didn’t materialize at the expected scale, and also because China’s support for Russia soured relations in a region with a recent history of Soviet domination.\n“The unlimited partnership and Beijing’s moral and material support to Moscow has infuriated many (Central and Eastern European) countries’ leadership and population,” said Tamas Matura, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis. “This has definitely weakened China’s position in Europe.”\nRelated article\nIn Europe, Xi looks to counter claims China is aiding Russia in Ukraine\nMeanwhile, longstanding tensions with Nordic countries and Italy’s exit earlier this year from the Belt and Road, as well as recent visits to China by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, meant none of those countries were ideal for Xi to visit, Matura added. France, he said, was likely seen by Beijing as creating a potential for a diplomatic opening given its advocacy for Europe’s strategic autonomy from the US.\nBut there were few tangible signs from the trip that friction with Western European countries and the EU would abate, despite both Macron and Von der Leyen stressing the importance of dialogue and Xi’s two-day visit with the French president, which included a more personal trip to the Pyrenees and the signing of 18 cooperation deals.\nAnd despite their limited economic heft – with 16 million people between them, and a combined GDP about a tenth of France’s, according to IMF figures – Serbia and EU member Hungary may become increasingly valuable to Beijing as tensions with the bloc continue, and the threat of a trade war looms.\n“Orban and Vucic are both the kind of illiberal leaders who are positioning their countries between the rivaling geo-political blocs, hoping to avoid too strong dependence on any one of them,” said former Hungarian member of Parliament Gabor Scheiring, an assistant professor of comparative politics at Georgetown University in Qatar. “They don’t care about democracy or human rights. For them, foreign policy is strictly pragmatically about economic interests.”\nAnd that could be a boon for China.\n“Hungary and Serbia are strategic gateways for Beijing toward Europe…  the value of the two countries as gateways to Europe will increase as the trade war escalates,” he said.\nCNN’s Xiaofei Xu contributed to this report.\n",

    "content": "As a business leader, your mental health can sometimes take a backseat to deadlines and bottom lines. However, prioritizing your mental well-being is a critical component of resilience, which is necessary for sustainable success.\nTo help you maintain balance, the members of Newsweek Expert Forum share their tried-and-true strategies for prioritizing their mental health. From carving out tech-free time to getting regular exercise, these methods can support your overall well-being while you continue to lead effectively.\nOver the last 2.5 years, I've noticed how effective being outside in some capacity has helped to not only improve my mood but also give me clarity on things I've been thinking through. Make sure to actually schedule this time as well. This is important for leaders because it helps them show up more grounded in their decision-making and sets an example for their team. - André Blackman, True Search\nAs leaders, we all need to take care of our mental health so as not to drive others crazy. We all spend most of our days in front of screens, so we get disconnected from our bodies. Then, paradoxically, our minds start going around in circles. To restore my sanity, I prioritize movement breaks by going outside and connecting with real three-dimensional human beings, even when I feel time pressure. - Paula Oleska, Natural Intelligence Systems\nAs an entrepreneur, I've realized the importance of prioritizing my mental health and overall well-being. Simple things like exercise and taking time to relax help me stay focused and positive. I find that talking to my coach often helps me refocus on the balance between work and personal life. - Jason Hennessey, Hennessey Digital\nRest and downtime can help improve cognitive function and decision-making abilities. Leaders who take time to disconnect and recharge often return with clearer minds and fresh perspectives, which are crucial for strategic thinking and problem-solving. - Britton Bloch, Navy Federal\nEveryone needs to have a break from stress and spend time with family and friends. Work hard, but also play hard. No one can survive a 24/7 stressful environment for long periods because you lose effectiveness as a leader and as an employee. Avoid complications and addictions in life. Strive for a healthy balance of exercising, eating right and getting enough rest. - Zain Jaffer, Zain Ventures\nI practice strategic solitude and set intentional, dedicated and uninterrupted periods of tech-free reflection. It is a mindfulness approach that allows me to not only disconnect from the physical world but also recharge my cognitive resources. Other leaders can adopt this practice to enhance their decision making and maintain an empathetic leadership persona. - Dr. Kira Graves, Kira Graves Consulting\nTherapy and exercise have been my saving grace as a business owner and leader. Especially as I've gotten older, I realize the importance of taking care of my well-being. For me, these two things are life-saving tactics for maintaining good mental health. - Tammy Sons, Tn Nursery\nPractice excellent self-care and setting clear boundaries between your work and personal life. By fostering a healthy work-life balance, you recharge, maintain focus and make sound decisions. A clear mind leads to increased productivity, creativity and better overall leadership. In this way, taking care of our mental health positively impacts our teams and organizations. - Anna Yusim, MD, Yusim Psychiatry, Consulting & Executive Coaching\nI see every transition in my day as a chance to reset and clear away any internal \"clutter.\" In the past, I filled these moments with distractions, which hindered my ability to recharge in small, real-time bursts. However, by seizing these opportunities to pause and be present, I've enhanced my focus, worked more creatively and resisted the urge to multitask as the day continues to unfold. - Leah Marone, Corporate Wellness Consultant\nHow you start the day sets the tone for your whole day. Prioritize an activity that supports your mental health first thing in the morning, such as meditation, movement or journaling. Then, practice power pauses throughout the day. Taking a couple of deep breaths can help you reset in as little as 60 seconds. - Karen Mangia, The Engineered Innovation Group\nBusiness leaders must inspire others, and it is hard to do when we are exhausted. We must be conscious about taking a break, even when we have much to do. Whether it is just a walk or a weekend trip, we need time for ourselves. - Krisztina Veres, Veres Career Consulting\nAn essential part of leadership is the clarity that comes from prioritizing our mental health. By taking time to rest and reflect, we recharge our mental and physical batteries. Setting up space in our day for self-care creates the opportunity to re-energize so that we can operate at full capacity and make better decisions. This helps our well-being and the overall well-being of those around us. - Henry Kurkowski, eWireless\n",

    "content": "As we edge closer to November's general election, many celebrities are expressing support for either Donald Trump or Joe Biden, but a growing number back independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nKennedy, son of former Senator Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of former President John F. Kennedy—both assassinated in the 1960s—rose to prominence in recent years with his vocal stance against vaccines.\nThe 70-year-old attorney sought to challenge Joe Biden for the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination but withdrew from the race and declared himself an independent candidate in October 2023.\nMany view Kennedy as a controversial choice due to his strong anti-vaccine stance and reported support of conspiracy theories, such as the unsubstantiated beliefs that COVID-19 targets certain races, the 2004 presidential election was stolen by voter fraud, and a link between mass shootings and prescription drugs.\nAs more celebrities speak out in support of Kennedy, Newsweek has compiled a list of them.\nNewsweek emailed Kennedy's press team for comment on Thursday.\nOn Saturday, former New Kids on the Block star Donnie Wahlberg and his wife, actor Jenny McCarthy, publicly endorsed Kennedy on social media.\nIn a video uploaded to Instagram, McCarthy said: \"I'm endorsing Bobby for president.\"\n\"Our dear friend Bobby,\" Wahlberg chimed in, before the duo shouted: \"Go Bobby.\"\nIn 2023, the actor and comedian endorsed Kennedy in the 2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries. Then, in April this year, Schneider appeared on Fox & Friends First to explain why he supported the independent presidential candidate.\nSchneider said health care is one of his top priorities: \"We spent five times more than they do in Europe for health care. And we have way worse results. We can't have 60 percent of the American population, unhealthy, 54 percent of children. That needs to be the biggest story for you guys in all mass media. The fact that children have chronic illness at over 50 percent, that's a 10-12-year-old statistic. So we have to get people healthy.\"\nHe added: \"[Kenny is] talking about things that really matter.\"\nSchneider also stated that people are tired of being offered the same thing, alluding to the potential rematch between President Biden and former President Trump.\nIn a post to Instagram on June 6, 2023, Alicia Silverstone revealed that in 2022, she canceled her Democratic Party registration and registered as an independent voter.\nShe explained that she did this because she was \"deeply disappointed with political leadership at every turn.\" The Clueless star pointed to \"division,\" \"lies\" and \"the profiteering at the expense of the people and public health.\"\n\"But @robertfkennedyjr gives me hope,\" she wrote. \"This man gets me excited about the potential for truth and justice. He provides hope for young and old to trust our government once again. RFK Jr. is a person we can be inspired and be proud to call President.\n\"Bobby is a true leader. He loves our country deeply and is the most courageous warrior. He fights for all mothers and children. He fights for our planet, fairness, and freedom. He is someone who can unify the divide in this country. He is a walking history book; a passionate loving human with no tolerance for corruption or bullying.\n\"I love his vision of peace, unity, and justice for all. I am uplifted by his commitment to protect civil and worker rights as well as our children's health. We need leaders who will resolve poverty, pollution, inequality, and stop wars... Bobby is that leader.\"\nSilverstone finished the post by recommending that those feeling disenfranchised by the government listen to Kennedy speak. She also stated that she has worked alongside Kennedy for children's health and our environment for \"15-plus years.\"\nShe added: \"I love me some Bobby!! He is just incredible. If you want more information, go to Kennedy24.com to learn more about this incredible leader.\"\nOn May 6, Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey took to social media to call Kennedy a \"formidable fighter for justice\" and a \"loyal friend\" when he reposted a promotional video for Kennedy's presidential campaign narrated by actor Woody Harrelson.\n\"There's a lot I can learn from this man. When the world turned its back on me, Bobby leaned in [prayer emoji],\" Spacey wrote on X (formerly Twitter), referring to the charges of sexual misconduct leveled against him which he was cleared of in court.\n\"He's a formidable fighter for justice and a loyal friend that's not afraid to stand up for what he believes.\"\nWhile Harrelson narrated the video, he denied that he was endorsing Kennedy.\n\"Bobby is a personal friend,\" he told USA TODAY through his representative. \"I don't endorse candidates from either party because I'm an anarchist.\"\nCheryl Hines, who starred in Curb Your Enthusiasm, has been married to the independent candidate since 2014. She publicly supports her husband by attending a variety of his fundraisers and rallies.\nWhile Hines supports Kennedy's political goals, she doesn't agree with all of his opinions. On January 23 Kennedy spoke at an anti-vaccine rally, where he compared the pressure to get vaccinated to the Nazi regime.\n\"Even in Hitler's Germany, you could cross the Alps into Switzerland, you could hide in an attic like Anne Frank did. Today, the mechanisms are being put in place that will make it so none of us can run, and none of us can hide,\" he said.\nWhen a video of the speech went viral online, Hines wrote on X: \"My husband's opinions are not a reflection of my own. While we love each other, we differ on many current issues.\"\nIn recent months Jessica Sutta, a former member of The Pussycat Dolls, has been supporting Kennedy and Nicole Shanahan, his running mate, in a variety of posts on social media. She has also spoken at their voter rallies.\nIn an Instagram post from March, Sutta explained that she didn't become a political person until \"my health was ripped from me.\" She claimed that she had been diagnosed with vaccine-induced lupus, which has taught her to \"stand for what's right for humanity.\"\nHer caption continued: \"Sorry to disappoint but I will not back down. I Def [sic] did not feel good yesterday as my body was in a lupus flare but it was beautiful for my soul to be apart [sic] of history. Proud to know @theangiestanton who did incredible yesterday!! Nicole Shanahan is gonna make a perfect VP. Her goal is to end the epidemic for chronic illness amongst our youth. Let's GO!\"\nWhile Pierce Brosnan hasn't publicly said anything himself, a photo of him alongside Kennedy was uploaded to X on September 22, 2023.\nKennedy uploaded a photo of him and the movie star with the caption: \"Two Irishmen at the Kennedy for President fundraiser on Point Dume last night.\"\nIn September 2023, Eric Clapton raised $2.2 million for Kennedy at a private fundraiser. According to a statement from Kennedy's campaign, the event raised $1 million for the campaign and $1.2 million for a super political action committee supporting him.\nTickets for the event, where the Grammy-winning musician performed live, cost from $3,300 to $6,600.\n\"Please join Eric Clapton and me in LA for a special campaign fundraiser + private musical performance!\" Kennedy posted to X in August 2023.\nRumors previously circulated that NFL veteran Aaron Rodgers might have been chosen as a running mate for the independent presidential candidate. While Kennedy eventually chose Shanahan, Rodgers explained how he felt about the possibility of him taking on the role during an interview with Tucker Carlson.\n\"My thing is [Donald Trump] had four years to do it and didn't drain the swamp,\" Rodgers said. \"And whether he just got scared because of what he learned when he was in there — I think it's very plausible.\n\"But that's why I was interested when Bobby came to me and said: 'Would you think about being my running mate?' And I said, 'Are you serious? I'm a f****** football player.' But I love this country, and I'd love to be a part of bringing it back to what she used to be.\"\nRodgers, who led the Green Bay Packers to Super Bowl victory in 2011, told Carlson he considered taking on the position, saying: \"Oh yeah, I thought about it. I definitely thought about it because I love Bobby, and I just wanted to hear what he had to say about it.\"\nRodgers has continued to publicly support Kennedy.\nJeremy Piven, best-known for Entourage, was a surprise guest at \"A Night of Laughter With RFK Jr. & Friends,\" Kennedy's comedy fundraiser in downtown Los Angeles in February. Piven compared white men to Bitcoin during his time on stage.\n\"We were the toast of the town, and now everyone's trying to dump us,\" he said, per The Washington Post.\n",

Alone at a sporting event,\" wrote one user, with another highlighting that his soccer appearance comes as he is operating a reduced working schedule following the announcement that Princess Kate was diagnosed with cancer back in March.\n\"Prince William isn't able to do royal work for months now due to having to 'take care of his sick wife,' but today, on his daughter's birthday, he was able to attend #AVLOLY,\" they wrote in a post that has gone viral, being viewed over 100,000 times on the platform so far.\nFans of the royal were also quick to defend his appearance.\n\"At what point do people realize that the football kicks off at 8 [PM] and most kids are in their beds by that time because it's a school night anything to hate on William I swear,\" wrote one supporter.\n\"Question: Is it okay for William to be enjoying himself watching football matches every now and then while his wife is in chemotherapy?\" posted another. \"Saw a comment by my favorite Wales fan page that got me thinking.... Why is it wrong for him to do that?\"\nNewsweek approached Kensington Palace via email for comment.\nWilliam is not the first royal to be criticized for spending part of their children's birthday at a sporting event.\nPrince Harry faced a social media grilling for taking part in a polo game with his team Los Padres at his local club in California on May 6, 2022, his eldest child, Prince Archie's third birthday.\nHe subsequently spent his son's fourth birthday in Britain as it fell on the same day as King Charles III's historic coronation ceremony in London. While Harry attended the event solo, his wife Meghan and their two children, Archie and Princess Lilibet, remained at their family home in Montecito, California.\nWilliam's match appearance in Birmingham on Thursday did not appear to bring his team good luck. Aston Villa lost their game against Olympiacos 2-4, with the prince's celebrations and disappointments caught by cameras officially covering the event.\nJames Crawford-Smith is Newsweek's royal reporter, based in London.

    "content": "Burkina Faso’s military in February summarily executed about 223 villagers, including at least 56 children, as part of a campaign against civilians accused of collaborating with jihadist militants, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said on Thursday.\nThe watchdog made the assertions in a report based on its own investigation into the reported execution of around 170 people in attacks on three villages in Burkina Faso’s northern Yatenga province in late February. A regional prosecutor based in the provincial capital Ouahigouya first flagged the killings in a statement on March 1.\nThe spokesperson for the Burkina Faso government did not respond to phone calls seeking comment on the HRW report. The ministry of defense did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Facebook and via email. A telephone number for the ministry listed on its website did not exist.\nThe attacks on the villages of Komsilga, Nodin and Soro were attributed to unidentified assailants, the prosecutor said in the statement, adding that an investigation had been launched.\nAs with previous cases of extrajudicial killings in the country, no official findings have been released.\nRights groups have previously accused the military in junta-ruled Burkina Faso of attacking and killing civilians suspected of collaborating with militants in retaliatory operations.\nThe executions coincided with a Feb. 25 report on Burkina Faso national television about a major attack on military targets in Yatenga, one of several areas affected by violent Islamist groups active in the north of Burkina and other Sahel nations.\nAuthorities have previously denied reports of soldiers killing civilians.\nHuman Rights Watch interviewed 23 people by telephone between Feb. 28 and March 31, including witnesses to the killings, local civil society activists and international organizations. It also verified footage shared by survivors.\nRelated article\nAround 170 ‘executed’ in three Burkina Faso villages, public prosecutor says\nWitnesses said more than 100 soldiers went to the village of Nodin and then to the nearby village of Soro on Feb. 25, where they killed residents in retaliation for a jihadist attack on a military camp about 25 km (15 miles) away.\nThe soldiers went door-to-door, ordering people out of their homes and rounding them up before opening fire, HRW said in its report, citing witnesses.\nSurvivors and people who helped bury the bodies compiled two lists with a total 223 victims from Nodin and Soro. Most were buried in mass graves.\n“The Burkinabe army has repeatedly committed mass atrocities against civilians in the name of fighting terrorism with almost no one held to account,” HRW executive director Tirana Hassan said in the report.\nThe watchdog has called on authorities to investigate the massacres and to do so with support from the African Union and the United Nations for independence and impartiality.\nBurkina Faso is one of several Sahel nations that have been struggling to contain Islamist insurgencies linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State that have spread from neighboring Mali since 2012, killing thousands and displacing millions.\nFrustrations over authorities’ failure to protect civilians have contributed to two coups in Mali, two in Burkina Faso and one in Niger since 2020.\nRights groups have also accused Mali’s army of using retaliatory tactics on civilians, which it denies.\n",

    "content": "Legal analyst Steve Vladeck wrote Saturday in an opinion piece for MSNBC that a recent move by former President Donald Trump's lawyers in his Mar-a-Lago classified documents case is \"doomed to fail.\"\nIn a new motion filed on Thursday to U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who is overseeing the case and was appointed by the former president in 2020, Trump's lawyers argue that a Chinese immigrant's 1886 Supreme Court triumph provides \"selective prosecution\" precedent for throwing out Trump's charges in the classified documents case.\nTrump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has pleaded not guilty to Department of Justice (DOJ) special counsel Jack Smith's 40 charges where it's alleged that he retained classified materials after he left the White House in January 2021 and then obstructed the federal attempt to retrieve them from his Mar-a-Lago resort residence in Palm Beach, Florida.\nTrump's team cites the Court case, Yick Wo v. Hopkins, involving \"Lee Yick,\" who was convicted for operating an unlicensed laundry in San Francisco. The immigrant sued and eventually won a landmark Supreme Court case that stated that Yick's Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution's 14th Amendment was being violated.\nIn the case's decision, Justice Stanley Matthews wrote that even if a law's wording appears fair, the Constitution bars the law if it is administered \"with an evil eye and unequal hand, so as practically to make unjust and illegal discrimination.\"\nHowever, Vladeck contends in his opinion piece that Trump's lawyers will struggle to convince Cannon that their client is comparable to Yick and his Supreme Court argument.\n\"Like claims about the unfairness of pretrial detention or the severity of the sentences in the Jan. 6 cases, there is a familiar — and perverse — irony at the bottom of Trump's selective prosecution argument,\" Vladeck, a University of Texas School of Law professor, wrote. \"Maybe we ought to discuss limiting the circumstances, in general, in which pretrial defendants can be detained. Maybe we ought to discuss reforms to all federal criminal sentences. Maybe we ought to discuss making it easier for defendants to establish selective prosecution claims. But as the selective prosecution claim in the Mar-a-Lago case makes clear, Trump isn't the poster child for these reforms; he's the anti-poster-child. Indeed, he's in the position he's in entirely because his behavior went so far beyond the limits of that of any of his predecessors.\"\nHe added: \"That wasn't true of Lee Yick, and that why Trump's arguments that he's just like Lee Yick are doomed to fail.\"\nNewsweek reached out to Trump lawyer Todd Blanche Saturday afternoon through his website. This story will be updated with any provided statements.\nThe trial date in the classified documents case has yet to be finalized, but Cannon is expected to postpone it beyond its scheduled start date of May 20.\nVladeck also provided two \"fatal problems\" to Trump's new motion, which was filed by Blanche and Chris Kise.\n\"First, for better or worse, the Supreme Court has made selective prosecution claims notoriously difficult to prove. Second, Trump is just about the worst possible person to bring a selective prosecution claim — since so much of his allegedly unlawful conduct in the Mar-a-Lago case is unprecedented,\" Vladeck wrote in his opinion piece. \"Only if the defendant could prove that the government had deliberately and intentionally singled him out from other similarly situated suspects without any good reason would such a claim succeed.\"\nIn the motion to Cannon, Trump attorneys list current and former government officials, including President Joe Biden, Trump's former Vice President Mike Pence and Trump's former 2016 opponent in the presidential race, Hillary Clinton. They claim that Trump's rivals have acted similarly to the former president in the Mar-a-Lago documents case, but \"no one in the government lifted a finger\" to their actions.\nRobert Hur, the DOJ's special counsel who investigated classified documents found at Biden's home and former offices, said in February that the president cooperated with his probe, which were among several \"material distinctions\" compared to Trump's documents case. Hur didn't bring charges against Biden, but found evidence that Biden willfully held onto sensitive material after he left the vice presidency in 2017.\nTrump's lawyers outline that Pence was found to be holding onto classified documents at his home in Indiana yet was not indicted. The motion says that Pence made a number of disclosures to the National Archives and Records Administration [NARA] after leaving the White House.\nThey also pointed to Clinton's use of a private email server for official messages when she was secretary of state under former President Barack Obama. The FBI did investigate Clinton and chose not to indict.\n\"For try as his brief might, it doesn't identify any other cases with similar claims about affirmative misrepresentations concerning the suspect's retention of classified information. Because there aren't any,\" Vladeck wrote. \"Indeed, the reason Trump's selective prosecution claim should fail is because of how much worse the conduct alleged in the Mar-a-Lago case is than that of the other officials his brief invokes as the relevant exemplars.\"\nHe added: \"In the court of public opinion, where facts don't matter all that much, Trump and his supporters can wave their hands and make the cases look similar. But in a court of law, that's not enough — and shouldn't be enough.\"\n",

Russia also attacked Ukraine with four surface-to-air guided missiles while drones attacked the eastern city of Kharkiv, damaging civilian infrastructure, Kyiv said.\nGerman company HENSOLDT will send six more TRML-4D radars to Ukraine to strengthen the country's air defense by the end of the year which the firm told Newsweek was part of a package of aid from Berlin worth over 100 million euros ($107 million).\nThe firm, which also supplies the German Armed Forces, said that the radars can detect and track drones, low-flying cruise missiles and aircraft, including helicopters, within a radius of up to 160 miles. \"Our radars are urgently needed by the Ukrainian air defense,\" said HENSOLDT CEO Oliver Dörre in a statement.\nIt comes as the German government has also said that it will send another Patriot air defense system to Ukraine as soon as possible. Newsweek has contacted the Ukrainian defense ministry for comment.\nAccording to German government figures, Berlin has sent eight TRML-4D radars to Ukraine so far, with another one being announced on April 29 as part of further military assistance.\nDespite the additional German assistance for Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has faced criticism for saying Berlin cannot supply the Taurus KEPD-350 missile, which Kyiv has long called for. Scholz has said its supply would draw Germany into the conflict and would require tactical assistance from Berlin that contravenes NATO members' efforts to contain the war in Ukraine.\nHowever, Berlin has remained a key ally for Ukraine against Russian aggression, having delivered or earmarked €28 billion ($30 billion) worth of military assistance to Ukraine, according to the latest German government figures.\nThe tranche announced this week includes at least 10 Marder combat vehicles, an air surveillance radar, as well as rounds of ammunition for Leopard 2 battle tanks.\nIt comes as Russian forces continue to build on momentum in the eastern front, following the capture of Avdiivka in the Donetsk oblast. Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) Deputy Chief Major General Vadym Skibitsky told The Economist that Russia is likely to launch an offensive at the end of May or the beginning of June.\nHe said Moscow is looking to take advantage of Ukraine's ongoing materiel and manpower shortages before an American military aid package just passed by U.S. Congress is set to arrive.\n",

She had asked her mom if she could try on the wedding dress she had donned 40 years ago for her own walk down the aisle. After the spontaneous trial resulted in a perfect fit, Miller decided to incorporate the gown into her own big day, but kept all the details hidden from her mom.\n\"I asked if I could use it in a special way during a part of our wedding festivities, and she allowed me to alter the dress as I saw fit,\" Miller told Newsweek. \"But she did not know when or how the dress would be used; she was just happy to share it with me.\"\nThe content creator, who is based in San Francisco, shared the touching moment she revealed the altered garment to her mom to TikTok on May 12.\nMiller enlisted the support of a tailor to get to work on the decades-old gown and bring her vision of a modern iteration, which keeps the \"authenticity of the dress\", to life. She decided to retain the ivory gown's off-shoulder puffed-sleeves and its ribbon at the back, while choosing to shorten its hemline.\n\"I decided to shorten the dress to wear it for our reception where there would be plenty of dancing,\" Miller said. \"I surprised her with it on the day.\"\nThe 3.1 million TikTok users who have viewed Miller's post were able to see her mom's candid gasp of awe and joy after seeing her dress brought back to life. The video, which has garnered over 469,000 likes, begins with a nostalgic scene of Miller trying on the original long gown in front of a mirror, her mother looking on in the background. The video then cuts to the reception, where Miller emerges in a shortened version of the dress—maintaining its original ribbon train that still cascades to her ankles.\n\"She was overcome with emotions—she was so happy and so excited to see her dress after she wore it for her own wedding with my dad 40 years ago,\" Miller said.\nThe bride had taken the DJ's first set as her queue to dash to the bathroom with her maid of honor and get changed into the dress, knowing that all the guests had been distracted. She later took to the dance floor for a special choreographed performance with her dad in the shortened gown, providing a heartwarming surprise for her mom and the rest of her family.\nViewers online have joined Miller and her mom in gushing over the memorable moment and the clean cut of the dress. More than 300 TikTok users have voiced their thoughts and well-wishes in the comments section of the post.\n\"It is not often that this is done so tastefully where the new piece looks equally as timeless and classy, such beautiful work and i'm so in love with the sleeves,\" one user, @_salsakitte_, wrote.\nAnother, @haileyannco, added: \"Such a cute way to incorporate your mom's dress.\"\n\"Oh my gosh how beautiful!

Additionally, you can't be claimed as a dependent for the previous tax year.\nAs for when the checks go out, Minnesota residents don't necessarily have to wait long.

Still, uncovering the scope of whales’ vocal exchanges is an important step toward linking whale calls to specific messages or social behaviors, the scientists reported May 7 in the journal Nature Communications.\n“This work builds on a lot of prior work focused on understanding the calls of sperm whales. However, this is the first work that has started to look at sperm whale calls in their wider communicative context and in the context of exchanges between whales, which has made some of the findings possible,” said study coauthor Dr. Daniela Rus, director of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT, in an email.\n“Understanding what aspects of their codas they can control and vary helps us understand how they can encode information in their calls,” Rus said.\nRelated article\nGreat apes tease each other just like humans do, says new study\nThe researchers dubbed their catalog of sound combinations a “phonetic alphabet” for sperm whales, comparing variations in the whales’ click sequences to the production of different phonetic sounds in human speech.\nBut while the team’s findings are interesting, that term offers a misleading perspective on whales’ vocal interactions, said Dr. Luke Rendell, a researcher at the University of St. Andrews in the United Kingdom whose work focuses on communication in marine mammals, in an email.\n“The presentation of the ‘phonetic alphabet’ — it’s nothing of the sort,” said Rendell, who was not involved in the research.\n“The way the tempo variation is used is completely different to how, say, we use elements of an alphabet to construct linguistic expression,” he said. “There’s no evidence of that, and it’s not a super helpful interpretation because it forces everything into a restricted and somewhat over-sold perspective of ‘is it like human language or not,’ when there are a much broader range of interpretations available.”\nSperm whales produce their clicks by forcing air through an organ in their heads called the spermaceti, and these sounds can be as loud as 230 decibels — louder than a rocket launch and capable of rupturing human eardrums — another team of scientists previously reported in the journal Scientific Reports.\nFor the new study, the researchers used machine learning to detect patterns in audio data collected by The Dominica Sperm Whale Project, a repository for observations of sperm whales that inhabit the Caribbean Sea. The recordings represented the voices of approximately 60 sperm whales — a subset of a group of about 400 whales known as the Eastern Caribbean clan — and the vocalizations were recorded between 2005 and 2018.\nPrior research had identified 150 types of codas in sperm whales worldwide, but the Caribbean whales used just 21 of those codas.\nThe scientists examined the timing and frequency of 8,719 coda sequences — in solitary whale utterances, in choruses and in call-and-response exchanges between whales. When visualized with artificial intelligence, previously unseen coda patterns emerged.\nRelated article\nThese snakes not only fake their own deaths, they use gory special effects to do it\nThe study authors defined four features in codas: rhythm, tempo, rubato and ornamentation. Rhythm describes the sequence of intervals between clicks. Tempo is the duration of the entire coda. Rubato refers to variations in duration across adjacent codas of the same rhythm and tempo. And ornamentation is an “extra click” added at the end of a coda in a group of shorter codas, Rus explained.\nThese so-called ornament clicks “occur more towards the beginning and end of turns” during vocal exchanges between whales, “behaving like discourse markers,” Rus said.\nThe discovery that whales could synchronize variations in coda tempo was “a really interesting observation,” Rendell said.\n“I am less convinced by the ‘ornamentation,’” he added. “It occurs very rarely, and I think we need more evidence that they aren’t just production glitches,” or filler sounds, “like when we say ‘um’ or ‘err.’”\nIn all, the program detected 18 types of rhythm, five types of tempo, three types of rubato and two types of ornamentation. These coda features could all be mixed and matched to form an “enormous repertoire” of phrases, the study authors reported. What’s more, meaning could be tweaked even further depending on the placement of a coda — following or overlapping other codas — within an exchange or chorus involving two or more whales.\n“Actually, many of us have been waiting for advanced technology to allow us to do something like this for decades!” said Dr. Brenda McCowan, a professor at the University of California Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, in an email.\nMcCowan, who was not involved in the research, was part of another team that, in 2021, conducted an interactive “conversation” with a humpback whale in waters near Alaska. For about 20 minutes, a curious whale repeatedly responded to a recording of a humpback song transmitted from the scientists’ boat.\n“This particular playback (with the humpback in 2021) was an opportunistic experiment with an inquisitive whale engaging us both behaviorally and vocally, and completely at her own volition,” McCowan said.\nRelated article\nA lone orca killed a great white in less than two minutes. Scientists say it could signal an ecological shift\nSuch interactive experimentation with whales, along with observations of whale behavior, could be an important part of unraveling the syntax of sperm whale click sequences, the authors wrote in the study.\nTheir machine learning method may also prove useful for studying other types of animal vocalizations, McCowan added.\n“Tempo, rhythm, rubato and ornamentation are likely to be found in other species of whales,” McCowan said. “We already know this is true of humpback song. But there is also evidence for this type of patterning in other aquatic, terrestrial and arboreal species to which this approach could be applied.”\nBut although this technique is helpful for identifying certain aspects of communication, it’s no Rosetta stone, Rendell cautioned.\n“Machine learning is great for finding patterns in large datasets,” he said, “but it doesn’t create meaning.”\nMindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine.\n",

CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy.\nDubai is set to add another towering figure to its skyline.\nThe Aeternitas Tower, officially unveiled at a launch event last week, will be the world’s tallest residential clock tower at a staggering 450 meters (1,476 feet) tall — more than four times the height of London’s Big Ben, and just 22 meters (72 feet) short of the world’s tallest residential building, the Central Park Tower in New York City.\nSet to become the world’s second-tallest clock tower (after the Makkah Clock Royal Tower in Mecca, Saudi Arabia), Aeternitas Tower is the result of a partnership between Dubai-based real estate developer London Gate and Swiss luxury watch manufacturer Franck Muller.\nLondon Gate purchased the plot of land in Dubai Marina, which already had the beginnings of an unfinished 106-story structure — and knew that the tower’s monumental size needed a striking facade, said Tom Hill, media relations coordinator for the developer.\n“We believe the clock will be seen from six kilometers away because of the sheer height of the building,” said Hill, adding that the clock face will be an enormous 40 meters (131 feet) tall and 30 meters (98 feet) wide.\n“We wanted to do something different that hasn’t been done before in Dubai,” said Hill.\nThe residential tower comprises 649 units, with a mix of one- to three-bedroom apartments, in addition to villa and mansion duplexes.\nWith housekeeping, a concierge service, and a 24-hour valet and porter, residents will have access to hotel-like services and facilities, but with the privacy and comfort of home.\nIts shared amenities range from health facilities, including a gym, padel court, spa, yoga studio, and swimming pool, to arts and culture spaces such as a cinema, music room, and library.\nYet-to-be-built Dubai penthouse sells for record $136 million\nThe project will be handed over to residents in 2027, according to London Gate.\nThe tower’s name means “eternity” in Latin, and is inspired by the Franck Muller Aeternitas watch collection — one of the brand’s most complex designs which features an “eternal calendar,” said Erol Baliyan, managing director of Franck Muller in the Middle East and Africa.\nThe Swiss watchmaker sees its step into real estate as a move that will help create a monument that “mirrors the brand’s innovation, craftsmanship, and timeless elegance,” said Baliyan.\nAside from the striking clock face (inspired by Franck Muller’s art deco-style Long Island Collection, which has irregular squashed and stretched numbers in a rectangular case), the watchmaker will infuse its design ethos throughout the residence, said Baliyan.\nHe highlights luxury materials like brushed and polished metals, that will be contrasted with marble surfaces, textured fabrics and bold colors. Meanwhile, in the lobby and reception, the signature oblong face of the brand’s Curvex watch is represented with curved walls, archways, and oval furnishings.\n“Attention to detail is paramount, with meticulously crafted joinery and carefully arranged lighting and furniture, ensuring a refined ambiance,” said Baliyan.\nThe Aeternitas Tower is part of a growing trend in Dubai. Luxury property is booming in the Emirate, and branded residences — collaborations between designer brands and property developers — are surging in popularity.\nAs of October 2023, there were 51 completed projects in the city, a figure that is expected to double by 2030, according to Savills Research, with brands like fashion house Karl Lagerfeld, car manufacturer Mercedes-Benz, and hoteliers 25Hours all announcing residential projects in the past year.\nThis photographer is creating surreal, dramatic images of Dubai’s stunning skyline\nLondon Gate began phase one of its sales last week, with one-bedroom apartments starting at AED 1.6 million ($435,600).\n“We’ve had an unbelievable level of interest since the launch,” said Hill, adding that in the first two days, London Gate sold around 30% of the initial 30-floor release, including all the available one-bedroom apartments.\nHill believes that one factor driving interest is the tower’s location in Dubai Marina, where there’s a scarcity of sites for development, adding that an “iconic tower” like the Aeternitas is the first project of its kind to break ground in the district past few years.\nWhile this is London Gate’s first branded residence project, it won’t be its last, said Hill, adding that the company will announce its next branded partnership by the end of Q1 this year.\nAs a rapidly evolving market, property in Dubai is often sold off-plan, with buyers waiting years to see their purchase. This is where branded residences provide an extra layer of security, particularly for overseas buyers, said Hill.\n“When you have a brand as world-renowned as Franck Muller, for example […] you have that peace of mind that you’re going to be handed over a world-class product,” he added.\n",

CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy.\nTurkey is rich with ancient wonders. Straddling Europe and Asia, the country has been at the heart of numerous empires, which have left behind archaeological attractions to rival its many natural wonders.\nBut not everything sits above ground, basking in Turkish sunshine.\nLess obviously visible but equally impressive are the historical treasures, some more than 12,000 years old, that can be found underground.\nSome are well known. Istanbul’s Basilica Cistern, a columned reservoir that dates back to Roman times, has been open to tourists for decades and featured in movies including the James Bond classic “From Russia with Love.”\nOthers may not be as famous, but are no less spectacular or fascinating.\nHere are some of the best subterranean marvels that the country has to offer:\nLike the Basilica, this elegant cistern was built during late Roman times to ensure a supply of water to Constantinople, as Istanbul was once known.\nUnlike the Basilica, this underground chamber was completely forgotten about until less than 15 years ago.\nThe Şerefiye Cistern, was constructed during the reign of Theodosius II, ruler of the Eastern Roman - or Byzantine - Empire from 402 to 450 CE in what is now Istanbul’s Fatih district.\nIt was constructed to store fresh water brought from Belgrade Forest, a wilderness near the Black Sea north of the city, via a 155-mile-long canal network that included the ancient Aqueduct of Valens, which still stands in Fatih. The water was then distributed to citizens.\nAt 82 by 147 feet (25 by 45 meters), with a ceiling almost 36 feet high, walls eight feet thick and 32 marble columns, the structure – also known as the Theodosius Cistern – is as substantial as it is beautiful.\nRelated article\nThe stunning 30-hour train ride that sells out in minutes\nYet sometime around the late 18th or early 19th century its existence was completely forgotten after a large private estate was built on the site, and it lay hidden for many years.\nThe Istanbul municipality took over the buildings in the early 20th century, but it was only in 2010 when some unloved additions were demolished that the cistern’s underground entryway was rediscovered.\nThe 1,600-year-old water depot opened to the public in 2018. Inside, the columns topped with Corinthian capitals shimmer with a brilliant gleam, the highly polished brass rings reflecting the color and movement of installations and cultural events.\nEntering this cistern, the thick walls provide a cocoon from the outside world. The cacophony of the street above is replaced by the sounds of rippling water.\nWhen archaeological excavations began at Dara in 1986, it was a small settlement on a green, windswept plain about 19 miles (30 kilometers) outside the historic city of Mardin in southeast Turkey.\nOther than locals herding their livestock through the ruins of a garrison city dating to the 6th century, few people went there.\nNow, the site has given up numerous treasures including rock-cut tombs, an olive processing workshop and a series of underground cisterns.\nOne of them is so large that locals believed it was a zindan, a dungeon. They told fanciful tales of prisoners chained up for years, dependent on weak shafts of sunlight to calculate the passage of time.\nIn reality the cisterns stored water flowing down from the mountains for use by the locals and Roman soldiers stationed in Dara.\nBack in 1963 a Turkish farmer noticed his chickens kept going missing then reappeared as if by magic. Eager to solve the mystery he followed their tracks to a crack in the tufa, the volcanic rock that also forms Cappadocia’s peribaca fairy chimneys, and found the opening to an 18-story-deep cave system.\nDerinkuyu, “the deep well” as it translates in English, was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1985. It once provided safe haven for up to 20,000 people. Now tourists can take the same steps used by Christians fleeing Arab raiders hundreds of years ago.\nFresh air enters via deep air shafts, but despite this the atmosphere in Derinkuyu is close and becomes more humid as the route descends 328 feet (100 meters.)\nIn places the path ducks under low-hanging rock and twists back on itself. Fragments of conversation echo off the walls while the murky figures of other cave explorers appear in the distance.\nTraversing the eight floors open to the public, filled with the remains of churches, stables, wine presses and empty grave sites, history merges with the present.\nRelated article\nInside Turkey’s ‘hidden’ ski world\nThe elegant structures lining Istanbul’s popular pedestrian thoroughfare Istiklal Caddesi once housed corset-makers, carpet dealers and private clubs frequented by émigrés who had fled revolutionary Russia.\nIn ornate buildings like Rümeli Han, the who’s who of Istanbul came to dine and artists, actors and singers took center stage. Whether they used the mysterious tunnels, which lay undiscovered beneath it for years, only coming to light in 2017, is anyone’s guess.\nRümeli Han was built in 1894 for Sarıcazade Ragıp Pasha, Sultan Abdülhamid II’s head steward. Renovation work on the building began just over five years ago, at which point its subterranean secrets were revealed.\nThe tunnel is now open to the public, a rather mundane sign taped to the building’s elegant marble facade announces its presence.\nDown inside, tightly laid ochre-colored clay bricks block out the world above. Set at regular intervals along the walls, windowless rooms lead one into the other, ending at stairwells, now locked, that go back up to street level.\nNo one’s exactly sure of the purpose of the tunnels. Perhaps the elite used this underground pathway to move unseen from one assignation to another.\nFrom a distance, solid grey dry stone walls and a rectangular tower, the minaret, are all that is visible of the post-modern Sancaklar Mosque, located in a remote suburb on the outskirts of Istanbul.\nBut underneath is something that looks like it’s from another world entirely.\nOutside, the building is as much rooted in the past as the future. Scant vegetation ripples in the breeze and in the distance utilitarian apartment blocks march along the horizon. The dry stone suggests the boundaries of a farm while a surface pattern of parallel lines radiating down a gentle slope is reminiscent of ancient archaeological sites.\nThe interior, however, is a calm, womb-like space. The only decoration is rough-hewn masonry and slabs of reinforced concrete.\nIt’s an unusual but beautiful space. Every seat on the arcs of the building’s amphitheater has a clear line of sight to the mihrab, the part of the mosque that indicates the direction of Mecca. Here, rather than a traditional elaborately carved wall niche, the mirhab takes the form of a single beam of light.\nUnlike conventional designs, Sancaklar has no main dome, or any dome at all. Overhead, a tranquil sweep of smooth concrete lines in the style of a Zen garden reinforces the sense of peace.\nSancaklar Mosque is both impressive and formidable. Completed in 2012, it’s the architectural realization of the constant tension of the manmade and the natural, and our place in between.\nA space-age dome located not far outside Şanlıurfa in southeastern Turkey strikes a discordant note in the natural tapestry blooming on the rolling hills surrounding it. Archaeologically speaking, what it protects is even more disconcerting.\nInside the dome, visitors gaze down at huge stone stele – T-shaped columns weighing around five tonnes each, with carvings of wild animals on the sides.\nThey date to the pre-Pottery Neolithic Age. That’s around 9600-8200 BCE. In 2018, UNESCO recognized Göbeklitepe as the first manifestation of human-made monumental architecture in history. In comparison, Stonehenge, everyone’s must-see megalithic structure from 3000-2500 BCE, seems positively juvenile.\nAge aside, the discovery of this place of worship in 1994 turned archaeology on its head. Experts believe the T-shaped pillars were erected by hunter-gatherers for use as a place of worship, a practice previously only associated with settled agricultural communities.\nLooking at them in situ, it’s hard to picture anyone, human or otherwise, moving these enormous stones into place.\nTo better understand physically what creating Göbeklitepe entailed and to experience its scale and majesty from the ground up, it’s worth taking a wander through the full-scale replica in the Şanlıurfa Archaeology Museum.\nRelated article\nDatça: The beautiful Turkish peninsula forgotten by time\nSqueezed between buildings near the mouth of the Golden Horn, Yeraltı Mosque on a small street in Karaköy, Istanbul, is easy to overlook. An unassuming door opens into a simple interior design based on repetition and clean lines.\nHere, 42 squat piers run in parallel rows. Even on the warmest days the interior remains cool due to seven-foot-thick walls and the cold seeping up through the red carpet.\nAn eerie green glow emanates from the far end, but other than that, at first glance this mosque doesn’t seem to offer much in the way of interest.\nLooks can be deceiving.\nYeraltı, literally meaning underground, was originally a dungeon in the basement of a fort built by the Byzantines in the 8th century CE.\nIt was also the northern anchor point for an enormous chain stretched across to Istanbul’s ancient Topkapı Palace – once the seat of power for the Ottoman Empire – on the other side of the waterway aimed at stopping Turkish ships from entering and attacking the city. Like many a best-laid plan, it failed, allowing Fatih Sultan Mehmet to conquer the city in 1453.\nIn the following centuries, the fort was damaged, remodelled, repurposed and finally converted into a mosque by Grand Vizier Bahir Mustafa Paşa in 1757.\nAnd that weird glow? In 1640, a Nakşibendi dervish dreamt the bodies of two Arab soldiers thought to have participated in the failed siege of Constantinople in the 7th century were buried here.\nDuring the month of Ramadan it’s traditional for people to come and pray at their tombs, illuminated by bright neon, giving this usually quiet mosque an incongruously festive air.\nLisa Morrow is a freelance writer and sociologist living in Istanbul, Turkey.

    "content": "The changing language used by the Ukrainian military in 72 hours of daily updates tells the story: “Ongoing defensive fighting.” “Significantly worsened.” Russian “tactical success.”\nYou rarely ever hear Kyiv’s top brass sounding downbeat, but their steep southerly trajectory reflects the grave place Ukraine finds itself in. Russia is not just advancing slowly in one place; it appears to be advancing in four, across the frontline.\nMoscow knows it is on the clock: in about a month, the $61billion of US military aid will start to translate into Ukraine having the weapons it has been begging for. So, Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to be throwing whatever he can at it, knowing the fight will likely only get tougher for his forces in the summer ahead.\nFirst, and most acutely troubling, is the northern border near Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city. Russian forces have crossed the border in multiple locations and claim to have seized nine villages. Their move 3 to 4.5 miles (5 to 7 kilometers) into Ukraine, in the border area above Ukraine’s second city of Kharkiv, is arguably their fastest advance since the first days of the war. Russia has thrown five battalions at the border town of Vovchansk, Ukrainian officials said, which has been hit hard by airstrikes over the weekend.\nThe town of Lyptsi is at risk, say some military bloggers, and from there Russian forces could hit Kharkiv with artillery. This is a nightmare for Kyiv for two reasons: firstly, they liberated this land from Russian forces 18 months ago, yet failed, clearly, to fortify the area enough to prevent Moscow sweeping back with the ease with which they were swept out.\nAnd secondly, Russia can again tie up Ukraine’s over-stretched army with constant and grinding pressure on Kharkiv, exacting a toll with crude shelling on a vast urban center.\nRelated article\nShifting his fishing buddy sideways in the Kremlin, Putin chooses an economy expert for the war in Ukraine. Here’s why\nThen there is the rest of the front, where progress in Kharkiv region has been mirrored by old, exhausting fights suddenly seeing new Russian success. This should be the greatest cause for concern to Kyiv, as it suggests a coordinated bid to push in all directions and leave Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky with ugly choices about where to send limited resources, and where ultimately to sacrifice.\nMoving slowly south from Kharkiv, closer to Bakhmut, the town of Chasiv Yar has been under intense pressure – a valuable height above two key Ukrainian military towns, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, which could prove an exhaustive pressure point over the summer on Kyiv’s supply lines. Netailove and Krasnohorivka slightly further south show Russian forces making further gains to the west of Avdiivka, and threatening another key hub – Pokrovsk. If Ukraine begins to fall back further here, its grip on the remnants of Donetsk region could be at risk.\nAnd then overnight, Deep State Map, a Ukrainian military analysis group, said the southern village of Verbove was under greater threat – one of the minimal gains from Kyiv’s stymied summer counteroffensive last year. All across the board, the news is bad: it is a growing calamity.\nUkraine’s rhetorical response has been telling. Its leaders have, for once, openly said how bad it is. They appear to be shuffling commanders around – which is not something you do in the heat of battle without desperate reason. There is vocal criticism of the failure to prepare and fortify the northern border regions over the past year. Indeed, along much of the front line where there is not active fighting, and in the near-rear to active frontlines, fortifications seem wanting, if not entirely absent. It may be that Kyiv believed so much in its counteroffensive last summer, that it failed to entertain the idea of bad news this summer.\nKyiv’s larger problem is global attention. Trenchant statements from European ministers, and even visits from senior Biden administration officials, cannot cut through the fatigue or the notion that helping Ukraine win is something governments see they strategically must do, rather than something their publics actively demand. It is becoming a war the world wishes would go away – side-lined by the horrors of the Middle East – exactly when its outcome is most perilous and vital for European security.\nRelated article\nPutin replaces Russia’s defense minister with a civilian as Ukraine war rages and defense spending spirals\nPutin used the weekend to reshuffle some of his cabinet – moving Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to a more procedural role as National Security Council head, and perhaps further away from the wartime cookie jar. An accountant, Andrey Belousov, will take his place. But this is not necessarily a sign of retribution for failure, or a reset: the same old boys still get nice jobs. It smacks more of Moscow economizing, integrating the war more fully into the economy, and settling in for the longer haul.\nThe opposite is happening in the West, where the congressional dysfunction pausing that paused the US’s $61 billion in aid has already wreaked havoc on Ukraine’s military effort. Its forces are losing now because of that six-month delay in ammunition reaching them. Europe talks big about making up the gap, but it cannot. And Washington DC will now be in a whirlwind of electioneering ahead of the US elections in November just when Kyiv needs American certainty most.\nThe news is not just bad, it is worsening daily. The ground on the front lines is drying out, bringing us into the season to attack. Russia has momentum unlike anything seen since March 2022. Ukraine is being forced to admit just how bad the situation is. Much of the world may be tiring of this war, but Putin is not.\n",

Despite being sidelined after his stint with Haas after the 2022 season, the German driver maintains an unwavering resolve to reclaim his position in F1, currently serving as a reserve driver for Mercedes and participating in the World Endurance Championship (WEC) with Alpine.\nIn a candid interview with Independent, Schumacher explained:\n\"Fighting your way back is exhausting. You get this cake presented to you which is really good, but you're not allowed to eat it. And you have to watch everybody else eat it. So it's tough, for sure, but I know why I'm doing it.\nThe journey back to Formula 1 has been fraught with frustration and near-misses for Schumacher, who described it as an \"emotional rollercoaster.\" He continued:\n\"Frankly, the way I was two years ago has nothing to do with the person I am today. F1 has been a dream I've had since I was five years old and I'm not ready to let go of that dream, right?\n\"Sometimes you feel like you have a chance, then it actually never ends up happening because something else happens. It's been an emotional rollercoaster and a draining last few years. But I'm working my way back.\"\nIn a light-hearted moment amid his serious pursuit, Schumacher mentioned a whimsical approach to his situation. He commented, jokingly:\n\"Maybe I will start writing my CV and send it to people! It's never been a secret, my goal is to be back on the grid.\n\"I've shown in multiple ways that I am capable of winning championships. It's just a matter of it fitting into somebody's schedule, does it fit into their plan?\"\nDespite the setbacks, Schumacher remains optimistic about showcasing his untapped potential. \"There's a lot which hasn't been seen yet, especially from a driving point of view,\" he stated confidently. His time at Haas, though marked by variable performances including top-ten finishes at the 2022 British and Austrian Grands Prix, provided valuable lessons that Schumacher is eager to apply in future endeavors.\nSchumacher's adaptability and self-awareness shine through as he contemplates the various roles a driver might hold within a team.\n\"I understand how I could have improved [at Haas], and there's a lot more to show from my side. It's all about, what do you want in your team right now? Do you want somebody who you can build a team around? Good for marketing? Purely shut up and drive? There are so many different types of drivers. As for me, I'm really hungry for it. I just need to keep performing in WEC, showing everybody what I can do. Then people will know what they get if they hire me, and hopefully I'll be able to prove to everybody that they made the wrong decision in not keeping me.\"\nAfter Alpine confirmed it is parting ways with current driver Esteban Ocon at the end of the year, Schumacher, along with reserve driver Jack Doohan, is considered as one of the favorites to join the French team in 2025.\n",

    "content": "Three bewildered children sit on the roof of a mosque in Baghlan province, northern Afghanistan, their eyes blinking away mud that covers their entire bodies.\nBeside them, a rescuer lowers their baby brother, 2-year-old Arian, to the rooftop, a sheet tied around his waist that was used to pull him from the raging floodwaters below.\n“Take it, let’s get take off the rope from his body,” the rescuer says on the video. “Bring his mother to hold him in her arms and be warm.”\nIn the past few days, at least 300 people have been killed in flooding in 18 districts across at least three provinces in northern Afghanistan, according to the United Nations’ World Food Programme (WFP), with at least 200 injured.\nVideos show raging torrents of mud washing away mud houses – and people, their limbs flailing, in the fast-moving brown current, as would-be rescuers watch from higher ground, beyond reach.\nThe rescued children, ages 3, 5 and 6, were among eight siblings who were at home with their parents in Folo, in the Bulka district of Baghlan, when the flooding hit.\nTheir uncle Barakatullah, son of Haji Wakil Besmillah, the local school headmaster, told CNN something ominous seemed to be brewing late last week when severe wind swept through the district and neighboring areas, enveloping everything in darkness.\n“Visibility was so poor that we couldn’t even see each other,” he said.\nThen the rain started falling gently during Friday prayers – an unusual event for locals, who say it doesn’t rain very often so high in the mountain region, home to around 10,000 people, he added.\nAs the rain got heavier, suddenly the situation “turned dire.”\n“People fled to higher ground, seeking refuge in mountains and hills. Unfortunately, some individuals who were unable to leave their homes fell victim to the floodwaters,” he said.\nAerial photos show belongings piled in plastic bags on rooftops, among them the hooded figures of women forced to cover their entire bodies even in times of disaster.\n“Women who were rescued are forced to wear mud-soaked garments, while even infants as young as 2 to 3 months old are clothed in similarly soiled attire,” Barakatullah said.\nIn Folo, more than 100 people are believed to have been killed, he said – mostly women and children.\nSome burials began over the weekend, but many more are already believed to be buried deep beneath mud.\nThe torrent swept away animals and farmland in an area already facing severe food shortages, according to Timothy Anderson, head of the WFP in Afghanistan.\nHe said the areas hit by floods had already been marked vulnerable to starvation after a difficult summer when searing heat brought drought.\n“It was already pretty grim. And now it’s catastrophic,” he told CNN.\nMost years, locals expect to see flash flooding, he said. But this year, it’s been far worse.\nThe loss of the homes and their land is devastating for survivors, who were already among some of the country’s most impoverished people, Anderson said.\n“When people lose a bit of livestock, that’s actually their livelihood,” he said.\nRoad access to the worst affected areas has been cut by floodwaters, forcing the WFP to use donkeys to send in supplies.\nWithin the first day, the WFP had distributed high energy biscuits and food for children. They’re also supporting local bakeries to supply free bread. In the next days, teams will start distributing food to feed families for a month – what happens next is unclear.\nAnderson said 17 joint assessment teams are being sent to the area, along with other UN partners. He said it’ll take four or five days for the teams to properly examine the impact of the floods on people, and their housing and infrastructure.\nThis latest natural disaster comes after drought in Afghanistan, and is being seen as an example of a climate crisis hitting those who have least contributed to rising global temperatures.\n“They’re not net emitters of carbon,” said Anderson of the WFP. “This is a subsistence agriculture community and society. So, they’re bearing the brunt of it, without having necessarily contributed to the issue very much.”\nHe said during the recent dry months, efforts had been made to help the community capture rainfall in dams and irrigation canals to sustain crops. Now those efforts have been washed away, posing another challenge.\n“The need is massive, not just in Afghanistan. The world is seeing the impacts of much larger, more severe events, whether that’s drought, rainfalls cyclones,” Anderson said.\nRichard Bennett, the UN’s special rapporteur on human rights in Afghanistan said the recent floods “are a stark reminder of Afghanistan’s vulnerability to the climate crisis.”\nAnd in a statement Sunday, Teresa Anderson, the Global Climate Justice Lead at ActionAid International, said: “The climate crisis continues to rear its ugly head.”\n“With the latest incident, Afghanistan joins a long list of Global South countries grappling with floods this year,” she said.\n",

    "content": "Nearly every grocery store attempts to lure customers in with their loyalty programs, boasting special deals and price savings, but which ones should you truly trust?\nInflation stood at 3.4 percent year-over-year at the end of April, and Americans are looking for any way to make their dollar stretch. A big component of that is figuring out how to get the best grocery store deals, and rewards programs are a key way to save money on your weekly trip to the supermarket.\nRead more: What Is Inflation? Current Inflation Rate, Causes and How to Stay Ahead of Rising Costs\nBut not every loyalty program was designed equal to the others, so Newsweek has compiled a list of the top grocery store loyalty cards and how they stack up to each other.\nGrocery giant Kroger offers loyalty perks through Boost, but you'll have to spend $59 for the annual membership. Once signed up, you'll receive gas points and free next-day delivery on all your purchases.\n\"With gas prices still elevated, I advise clients to prioritize grocery loyalty programs with fuel rewards,\" Michael Ryan, a finance expert and founder of michaelryanmoney.com, told Newsweek. \"Even earning just 10-20 cents off per gallon can translate into major savings for families filling up multiple vehicles each week.\"\nRead more: Earn up to 5% Cash Back or More on Your Grocery Purchases\nIn addition to special deals, Kroger lets shoppers sign up for a Rewards World Elite Mastercard, where 5 percent cashback will be redeemed for the first $3,000 spent, with 2 percent cash back on Kroger purchases and 1 percent on other store purchases.\nAnother solid loyalty program is available at Giant via the Giant Flexible Rewards program. Like others, you can exchange your points for discounts on your purchases, whether made in store or online.\nImmediately upon signing up, you'll earn 500 flexible rewards points, which can be used at Shell gas stations. And for every dollar spent, you earn 1 point, with 100 points earning you $1 in savings. You'll also be privy to exclusive weekly deals and freebies.\nPiggly Wiggly, which operates stores across the Southeast, also rewards shoppers with a loyalty program should they choose to sign up.\nThrough the chain's Pig Points, you can score deals on food and gas on specific items in store.\nAt the gas station, you earn $1 off every purchase once you achieve 100 points.\nAlex Beene, a financial literacy instructor at the University of Tennessee at Martin, echoed the advice that shoppers should specifically look out for the fuel deals, granted free delivery can also be a compelling draw.\n\"When it comes to grocery store loyalty programs, fuel discounts are usually the gold standard. Grocery stores have both free and pay-for versions of their programs that offer a standard discount on gas that increases as customers spend more,\" Beene told Newsweek. \"However, for most looking for loyalty membership, it's more about free delivery and pick-up.\"\nPublix is also a fan-favorite grocery chain on the loyalty program bandwagon.\nThe store offers Club Publix, a free program that enables access to personalized deals, birthday freebies and digital savings. Specifically, you'll hear about many buy-one-get-one-free deals and weekly updates on the top sales items.\nPerhaps the biggest supermarket chain across the United States, Walmart has not let its loyalty program slide either.\nRead more: Capital One Walmart Rewards Mastercard Review\nWalmart+, however, is a bit pricier than some of the free options at its competitor stores.\nShoppers will have to fork over $98 to earn 10 cents off each gallon of gas at participating stations as well as free delivery for store orders more than $35. You'll also gain free next-day and two-day shipping from Walmart, and you'll be able to use a contactless checkout option for more easy shopping.\nWith the perks, the option might make sense if you're a frequent Walmart shopper and the savings would outweigh the $98 yearly fee.\nTarget, which likely remains Walmart's greatest competitor, has offered similar options through its Circle/REDcard.\nThe rules are a bit more straightforward: the card gives you a 5 percent discount every time you shop, whether that's in-store or online.\nThere's also automatic free shipping on most orders, and you can return items after a longer period.\n\"To maximize your grocery loyalty benefits, don't just sign up and forget about it. Stack those rewards with digital coupons, sales, and cash-back credit card offers,\" Ryan said. \"Many apps let you load digital coupons that are automatically deducted at checkout along with your loyalty discounts. It takes a little effort but can cut your grocery bill by 10 to 20 percent or more.\"\nShoppers should also consider using a credit card to help boost their grocery store purchase rewards. Several big-name cards offer special cash-back options, which could save you hundreds or even thousands in the long run.\nThe Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express, for example, supplies consumers with 6 percent cash back at U.S. supermarkets on up to $6,000 per year in purchases.\nMeanwhile, the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card offers three times the points on online grocery purchases, and the Citi Strata Premier Card gives the same three times points but on all supermarket purchases.\nJust keep in mind when using a credit card, there are undeniable risks. Shoppers are encouraged to use their credit cards like a debit card and avoid making purchases they wouldn't be able to afford with their monthly income, even if the rewards of using the card are plentiful.\n",

    "content": "A rental property secretly transformed by the eccentric artist who lived there for three decades has been officially protected by the British government, five years after his death.\nShortly after Ron Gittins died in September 2019 at age 79, his family visited the apartment where he had lived since the mid-1980s in Birkenhead, just outside of Liverpool in northwest England.\nWhat they found inside left them totally awestruck. Gittins had decorated almost every available surface in his home and painted numerous murals depicting historical scenes. Among the artworks were paintings set in Ancient Egypt and Georgian England, as well as fireplaces in the shape of a roaring lion’s head and a giant minotaur head, and there was even a Roman bread oven.\nThe discovery was particularly surprising as Gittins, who had limited formal artistic training, largely discouraged people from visiting his home, an apartment on the first floor of a Victorian duplex comprising three main rooms, a hallway, kitchen and bathroom.\nAfter his death it became clear why, according to his niece, Jan Williams.\n“The house was an absolute tip and you couldn’t even get through the door,” she told CNN in a telephone interview.\nWilliams said her uncle was “flamboyant” and “really outlandish” and was often seen around the town in costume, foraging for things that he would load into a shopping cart—such as bags of cement.\n“This is one of the reasons the family didn’t see that much of him,” said Williams, adding that she last saw him in the year before his death.\n“His behavior was quite challenging but we still loved him and thought the world of him.”\nEvery room of the apartment was piled high with bags, boxes, books, art materials, food packaging and much more, as well as many hand-written notes, some of them in code.\nSoon afterward, Williams and her partner Chris Teasdale, who are themselves both artists and run a mobile exhibition space, started a campaign to save “Ron’s Place,” supported by friends, relatives, artists and others working within the world of culture and heritage.\nTogether they established the Wirral Arts and Culture Community Land Trust (WACCLT), which launched a crowdfunding campaign through the website Ron’s Place, applied for listed status and eventually bought the building last year.\nNow, the property has been granted “Grade II” listing by Britain’s Department for Culture, Media and Sport on the advice of national heritage body Historic England.\nA spokesperson for Historic England explained the significance of the listing in an email to CNN, saying: “Including Ron’s Place on the National Heritage List for England allows us to highlight and celebrate what is significant about this extraordinary place, and helps us to make sure that any future changes to it do not result in the loss of its significance.”\n“Ron would be absolutely over the moon,” Williams said of her late uncle.\n“He was a kind of performance artist and the flat he created was like his stage set and own private world.\n“He did have some mental health issues and went through spells of being really unstable. I think it was his artwork and creativity that kept him going.”\nThe property is currently undergoing work to “stabilize and preserve” the artwork for a “micro-museum,” while the trust is also hoping to convert the other apartments in the building to create a “holistic house of art and creativity,” according to Williams.\nThe space will then be available for other artists to work in, while further plans could also include developing the garden and cellar.\n“It’s quite poignant because when I was sorting through his stuff after he died I found this postcard to me saying ‘I would really love to show you what I’ve been making’ but the address was wrong and I never received it. It’s almost like I’m making up for it now,” she said.\nRon’s Place is the first example of Outsider Art to be given protected status in England, according to Historic England.\nAn internationally recognized creative phenomenon, Outsider Art is described by Tate as “art that has a naïve quality, often produced by people who have not trained as artists or worked within the conventional structures of art production.” It is created without an audience in mind, usually by and for the artist themselves.\nIn a press release, Historic England said: “The listing recognises Ron’s creation as an exemplar of large-scale Outsider Art in England, a creative phenomenon by artists motivated by their personal visions and often working in a compulsive way, usually with no formal training and outside the influence of the mainstream art world.”\nAmong the many fans of Gittins’ works is Jarvis Cocker, front man of the indie band Pulp and a patron of the campaign to preserve the property.\nReacting to the news in a statement released by Historic England, Cocker, who is also a patron of Ron’s Place, said: “A small number of people on this planet have known for a while that Ron’s Place is a very Special Place—but from now on it is official: Ron’s Place has been given listed status!\n“The work of one unique gentleman in the north of England has been recognised nationally. Globally even. Hallelujah!!”\nWilliams is proud of her uncle’s achievements and hopeful about the impact he will have on future generations.\n“He encouraged me to see being creative and unconventional as completely normal and I’m grateful for that,” she said. “He never really held down a job and rarely had a reliable income for long but he did have a wealth of imagination and creativity. We want to share that with other people and say be creative and be resourceful and see the potential in others around and what you could make out of it.”\n",

    "publishedAt": "8:30 AM EDT, Sun May 12, 2024",
    "content": "A month after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the historian Yuval Noah Harari made a bold claim that seemed delusional.\nHarari made his claim in an essay on the heroism of the Ukrainian people. He praised embattled Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, who refused to flee his country when death seemed certain, telling his would-be rescuers that he needed ammunition, not a ride. He marveled at the outnumbered Ukrainian soldiers on Snake Island who told a Russian warship to “go f**k yourself,” and the civilians blocking Russian tanks with their bodies.\n“Nations are ultimately built on stories,” said Harari, author of “Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind.” “Each passing day adds more stories that Ukrainians will not only tell in the dark days ahead, but in the decades and generations to come … This is the stuff nations are built from. In the long run, these stories count for more than tanks.”\nBut there’s another type of story that’s gained traction in the US — the kind that can cause a nation to unravel. The new hit movie, “Civil War,” which has earned more than $100 million worldwide at the box office, is the latest example of a disturbing trend: We no longer seem to know how to tell well-crafted stories that counter those that depict American democracy as doomed.\nIn “Civil War,” tanks trample democracy. The film depicts a near-future America that has been torn apart by seceding regions and militia violence. It features a fascist leader in the White House, an attempted coup and Americans casually killing one another in the streets. One critic called it writer-director Alex Garland’s “very in-your-face attempt to imagine the unimaginable in America.”\nIt’s hard to imagine any other future for the United States when you consider the popularity of movies like “Civil War.” Most of the stories about the state of America that gain traction in popular culture are the ones that end in its failure. They’re the opposite of the hopeful, unifying stories any country needs to overcome tough times.\n“Civil War” is part of a growing entertainment genre that, to borrow a phrase from former President Donald Trump, could be called “American carnage.” Dystopian movies and TV shows like “The Walking Dead,” “The Purge,” “The Hunger Games,” “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “The Last of Us” all imagine a hellish future in America triggered by an environmental, political or civic collapse.\nThere’s nothing wrong with dystopian thrillers. They serve as cautionary tales and are as old as the book of Revelation. But the messages they send may be more dangerous than the violence depicted onscreen: The collapse of democracy is inevitable. Americans can never transcend their tribalism. Resistance is futile.\nThere’s something wrong when we churn out stories about superheroes in spandex banding together from different galaxies to save the universe, but we can’t tell a popular story that shows Americans coming together to save our country.\nIt didn’t used to be this way. There was another time when democracy in America was under threat, and filmmakers responded by making stirring movies aimed at lifting Americans’ spirit and equipping them for the battles ahead.\nConsider “Casablanca,” the classic 1942 film. It proves that you can tell a gripping story about patriotism without being sappy or boring. In the film, Humphrey Bogart plays Rick, the cynical owner of a Moroccan nightclub at the onset of World War II. The movie is remembered today for its classic lines (“Here’s looking at you kid”; “We’ll always have Paris”; “Round up the usual suspects”).\nYet there’s another classic line uttered by Rick — “I stick my neck out for nobody” — that hints at deeper reasons why “Casablanca” was made. The film is set before Pearl Harbor, when many Americans didn’t want to get involved in a European conflict. Adolf Hitler’s Nazi war machine seemed unstoppable. Fascism was on a global march. Democracy’s future seemed grim.\nRick responds to the impending crisis with apathy and cynicism. But when his old flame, played by actress Ingrid Bergman, walks into his club one night, she not only rekindles their romance but his idealism.\n“The movie was a patriotic rallying cry that affirmed a sense of national purpose,” wrote Cristóbal S. Berry-Cabán in an essay. “The film emphasized group effort and the value of individual sacrifices for a larger cause. It portrayed World War II as a peoples’ war, typically featuring a diverse group of people and ethnic backgrounds who are thrown together, tested, and molded into a dedicated (force) fighting fascism.”\nOther films of that era made similar storytelling choices. Legendary Hollywood director Frank Capra made a series of seven patriotic films during World War II called “Why We Fight” that rallied Americans in the fight against fascism.\nThe entertainer Frank Sinatra, a paragon of mid-20th century American masculinity, starred in a short film called “The House We Live In.” It would be labeled “woke” today. In the film, Sinatra intervenes when he sees a group of youths chasing a Jewish boy. He tells them that “religion makes no difference, except to a Nazi or someone who’s stupid.” The film was eventually selected by the Library of Congress as being “culturally and historically” significant.\nSinatra would later record a song with the same title as the film, which he would perform throughout his career. It included lines like, “The faces that I see. All races and religions. That’s America to me.”\nOther World War II-era films like “Don’t be a Sucker,” which emphasized racial and religious tolerance in America, emphasized the same message. It went viral after the 2017 neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\nThose black-and-white films may seem dated and idealistic in an America that has been through the Vietnam War, Watergate, 9/11 and January 6. But a country needs a unifying story like a human being needs oxygen.\n“Stories are essential to holding a nation together,” says Kermit Roosevelt III, a historian and author of “The Nation That Never Was: Reconstructing America’s Story.” “You have to have something that motivates people to make sacrifices for the nation. If you’re going to fight a war, you have to have people who are willing to lay down their lives. But we more often call on people to make sacrifices for others, to bear burdens, promote justice and help out the less fortunate.”\nThat doesn’t mean we return to the days of making clumsy propaganda films. But Roosevelt says we should keep in mind that most stories contain some elements of propaganda.\n“We have this idea that propaganda is bad or ideology is bad,” Roosevelt says. “But I think that history and education are inherently ideological, and there’s a perspective there and you’re trying to impart lessons.”\nSome of America’s most gifted political leaders knew that lesson well. Two of the most consequential presidents in recent memory — Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama — were master storytellers. They told stories that made Americans believe in democracy, in one another and in their country’s future.\nReagan’s skills were on display when he told a story about American vitality in his farewell speech that echoed Sinatra’s “The House We Live In.” He said the source of America’s greatness was immigrants.\n“While other countries cling to the stale past, here in America we breathe life into dreams,” Reagan said. “Thanks to each wave of new arrivals to this land of opportunity, we’re a nation forever young, forever bursting with energy and new ideas, and always on the cutting edge, always leading the world to the world to the next frontier. This quality is vital to our future as a nation.”\nFormer President Obama cited his personal story as a reason to believe in America, despite the country’s history of not living up to its ideals. The son of a White mother from Kansas and a Black father from Kenya, Obama said his journey to national prominence was proof that the American dream was possible.\n“I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on Earth is my story even possible,” he during his speech at the  2004 Democratic National Convention, which would eventually catapult him to the White House.\nIt’s easy to dismiss Reagan’s and Obama’s storytelling as the product of clever speechwriters. What candidate doesn’t call America great, or vow that anything is possible in the land of the free and home of the brave?\nBut the dominant American political figure of recent years does not typically tell such unifying stories about his country. Former President Trump coined the term “American carnage” during his 2017 inaugural address. He routinely describes an America that more resembles the failed state depicted in the “Civil War” movie, with his declaration in January that “We are a nation in decline, we are a failing nation.”\nTelling that kind of story hasn’t appeared to hurt Trump any more than it hurt the makers of “Civil War.” And, truth be told, stories of American greatness can ring hollow to the descendants of enslaved Americans, the Japanese Americans interned during World War II and those dismayed today by politicians and judges who disregard democratic norms.\nHow can we tell a story today that doesn’t ignore the brutality of American history but still inspires hope for the future?\nThere’s another figure from the past who may help us.\nWalt Whitman, the 19th century writer dubbed “the poet of democracy,” said that America was his greatest poem. Through poetry, Whitman did what so many seem incapable of today — he made a multiracial, multireligious democracy in America visceral and exciting, not a civics lesson.\nIn “Songs of Myself,” Whitman vividly described America as “the Nation of many nations,” and said of himself and his country,” “Of every hue and caste am I, of every rank and religion.”\nRead Whitman today and one is struck by his expansive definition of what it means to be an American. No one is excluded — he treats the “boatman and clam-diggers, the farmer, the deacon, the runaway slave, the prostitute and the president with equal reverence, “For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.”\nThe historian Ian Beacock said Whitman offers an answer for those who wonder how they can defend democracy against stories that predict its demise. He suggests they take Whitman’s approach: “State an emotional case for democracy that appeals as much to those who already possess power as to those yet without it.”\nIt starts with being honest about the appeal of other modes of government, like fascism, he says.\n“It’s obvious that being free and equal is better than being dominated,” Beacock wrote.” But is it better than dominating? Exerting power over others is a seductive feeling, too, if a dark and dangerous one.”\nMany democracies simply “unravel” because their citizens get complacent, Beacock says. Democracy is hard to sustain because of its constant demands for compromise. People often go shopping for alternatives that seem like less work, he says.\nWhitman told stories about democracy that engaged people’s feelings, not just their intellect, Beacock says.\n“This is perhaps Whitman’s core contribution to democratic thought and practice: the reminder that democracy’s defenders mustn’t neglect political feelings (“Logic and sermons never convince”) and that self-government must appeal to the human heart if it is to last long. “\nThe Austrian philosopher Ivan Illich was once asked about the most revolutionary way to change a society. He said:\n“Neither revolution nor reformation can ultimately change a society, rather you must tell a new powerful tale, one so persuasive that it sweeps away the old myths and becomes the preferred story, one so inclusive that it gathers all the bits of our past and our present into a coherent whole, one that even shines some light into our future so that we can take the next step…”\nHow Americans in 2024 decide to tell their national story is up for debate. What shouldn’t be up for discussion, though, is the need for such stories. Isn’t it time we tell a new story of a future America where the White House isn’t going up in flames and citizens aren’t murdering one another?\nThe box office success of “Civil War” ensures, though, that more “American carnage” stories are likely headed our way. Though the film doesn’t take any political sides, it amplifies the same message that autocrats in Russia and China are making through their propaganda: America is hopelessly divided and degenerate, and democracy is doomed.\nMaybe it’s time to rediscover what Americans of another era knew. Those old black-and-white films about what makes America special may seem corny now. But they understood that you must defend democracy not only with tanks, but with stirring tales that reverberate for generations to come.\nIf you believe democracy is under threat in America, find a “new powerful tale” that inspires us to believe it has a future.\nBut don’t dispense platitudes or give us a civics lesson.\nTell us a story.\nJohn Blake is a Senior Writer at CNN and the author of “More Than I Imagined: What a Black Man Discovered About the White Mother He Never Knew.”\n",

    "content": "Some Planters nut products are being recalled over concerns they may have been contaminated with listeria monocytogenes, its parent company Hormel Foods Sales announced on Friday.\nIn its announcement, the company said that two nut products are being recalled over the possible contamination, which can cause listeria that can be fatal for some people.\n\"The recalled product is limited to 4 oz. packages of PLANTERS® Honey Roasted Peanuts and 8.75 oz. cans of PLANTERS® Deluxe Lightly Salted Mixed Nuts. The 'Best if Used By Date' is located on the bottom of the Deluxe Lightly Salted Mixed Nuts can and the UPC code is located on the side of the can,\" the announcement reads.\nThe products were shipped to distribution warehouses in Florida, Georgia, Alabama and North Carolina, as well as to Dollar Tree distribution warehouses in South Carolina and Georgia, according to the announcement, which noted that other Planters products are not affected.\nNobody has reported becoming ill after consuming these products thus far, the company said. All retailers have been notified of the recall. The roasted peanuts have a universal product code of \"2900002097,\" while the lightly salted mixed nuts have a code of \"2900001621.\"\nIf a person has an affected product, they can either discard it or bring it back to the store for an exchange or full refund, according to the company.\n\"Our commitment to food safety remains our utmost priority. A full investigation is currently under way to determine the potential source of the contamination,\" the announcement reads.\nWhen reached by Newsweek on Sunday for comment, a company spokesperson referred to the press statement.\nAbout 1,600 people become sick with listeria each year and about 260 people die from the infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Those who are pregnant and their newborns, adults who are 65 years or older and people with weakened immune systems are most likely to become ill from the infection.\nRead more: Compare Top Health Savings Accounts\nThose who are pregnant and become ill with listeria may experience a fever or flu-like symptoms; others may also experience a headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and seizures, according to the CDC.\nIf the infection becomes invasive—meaning it has spread beyond the intestines—it can cause a miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery or a life-threatening infection a newborn.\nIt can also become severe for others, as about 1 in 20 people who are not pregnant and become infected with invasive listeria die, according to the CDC. People who become infected with invasive listeria may be treated with antibiotics.\nThe CDC suggests people at higher risk of developing the illness to avoid foods that may be more likely to cause the illness including unpasteurized soft cheeses, unheated deli meat, premade deli salads, refrigerated pate or meat spreads, refrigerated smoked fish, raw or lightly cooked sprouts, cut melon left open for more than two hours or in a refrigerator more than a week or unpasteurized milk products.\n",

    "content": "“I only go to casinos once a year, on Chinese New Year,” says Vivian Lai, a second-generation Macao resident who is training as a nurse. The tradition of gambling is said to bring good luck for the year to come, whether you win or lose.\nMacao, the Chinese special administrative region (SAR) often twinned with Hong Kong, is known as the Las Vegas of Asia. As the only place in greater China where gambling is legal, the city’s skyline is a who’s-who of the biggest names in the gaming industry.\nHome to just 600,000 residents – compared to seven million in Hong Kong – visitors to Macao might feel like the rest of the city lost in the shadow of the towering hotels and casinos. But travelers who are willing to dig in a little deeper can explore Macanese culture, which mixes Portuguese, Chinese and Southeast Asian heritages.\nMacao is comprised of two islands – the north one, Macao itself, and its southern neighbor Taipa. For a long time, Taipa was relatively rural, and people had to travel between the two islands by boat. The first bridge connecting the two was completed in 1972. Now, there are three, with a fourth in construction.\nRelated article\nNot just casinos: Macao reimagines tourism post-pandemic\nWhile the rest of the world may associate Macao with gambling, its citizens don’t necessarily feel the same way.\n“In Asia, [people] think that Macao is full of casinos, and I think they do not understand the other parts of Macao,” says Lai. “When I go to Europe, when I say I come from Macao, actually they don’t know where it is, so I have to say it’s a small city next to Hong Kong.”\nMarina Fernandes agrees. She is an eighth generation Macanese, from one of the oldest families on the island.\nLike a shrinking number of people in her community, she speaks the patua dialect, which mixes Portuguese and Chinese.\n“The locals seldom go to the casinos,” she says. “It’s a very small number of people who really go to the casino to gamble. We don’t gamble. We do other things. And actually the civil servants, they are forbidden to enter [casinos]. The gambling is more for the tourists, it’s not for the locals.”\nDue to rising costs of living in Macao, many employees of the casinos and luxury shops are increasingly likely to commute to work from Zhuhai, the less expensive mainland Chinese city just across the water from Macao, and to speak Mandarin Chinese instead of Cantonese.\nThough Macao’s special status as an SAR means that people traveling between Zhuhai and Macao still have to go through border control, the process is speedier for permanent residents and citizens with Chinese national ID cards thanks to express lanes.\nAccording to Macao’s 2021 census, about five-sixths of Macao’s population is ethnically Chinese. Only a few thousand are Portuguese. While Portuguese is still an official language of the city and must be used on signage and in government literature, many locals opted to learn English or Mandarin Chinese instead, especially ahead of the handover – when Macao was returned to Chinese rule – in 1999.\nMacao’s airport, located on eastern Taipa, is small but modern and easy to navigate. Home to a single terminal, most of its flights are from around the region, with regular connections to places like Singapore, Jakarta, Hanoi, Bangkok and Beijing. However, for longer-haul routes to North America and Europe, locals will have to head to nearby Hong Kong, Shenzhen or Guangzhou.\nThe mammoth Hong Kong-Macao-Zhuhai Bridge, the world’s longest sea-crossing bridge, was completed in 2018. It is just one of many Chinese projects intended to connect and promote the “Greater Bay Area” region.\nDespite the $20 billion bridge, infrastructure within Macao is a different story. Locals who don’t have cars rely mostly on public buses. While Hong Kong has an efficient, well-organized metro system, Macao’s LRT (light rapid transit) system started in 2019 and only has one line so far. Uber suspended its services in Macao in 2017, and taxis only accept cash.\nFernandes spent several years living in Portugal, but says she felt alienated there and decided to return to Macao.\n“We learned the Portuguese history. We know every city of Portugal. We sang proudly the Portuguese anthem,” says Fernandes. “Especially after the handover, they do not know us. They do not understand us, that we feel Portuguese.”\nShe says that the stereotypes she encountered about Macao involved gambling, triad gangs, and prostitution, as well as old cliches about Chinese people like that women still wore traditional qipao dresses and that men had the single braid or ponytail hairstyle.\nNow retired and her children grown, Fernandes has devoted her life to preserving and highlighting native Macanese culture. She works at the Associação dos Macaense (Macanese Association) and has opened the canteen there to the public so that more people can try traditional Macanese dishes like minchi (ground meat, usually pork, stir-fried with potatoes and soy sauce). Her next goal is to open a commercial restaurant catering to tourists.\nDue to its small size, Macao is strict about working policies for foreigners.\nRicardo Balocas, a Lisbon native who moved to Macao in 2013, has held a variety of jobs since relocating from Europe, including management roles at the Macao International Airport and at St. Joseph’s University, the only Catholic four-year university in Asia.\nMost foreigners – like Balocas – who move to Macao are eligible for permanent residency after seven years of living, working and paying taxes. That means that they can live in Macao without a work visa and do not need a company sponsoring them.\nResidents with local ID cards are also able to use the city’s socialized health care. Macao citizens and permanent residents get an annual perk in the form of 10,000 patacas ($1,240) a year from the government.\nHowever, the rules are different for many of the workers who come from poorer parts of the world, namely the Philippines. Many Filipinos come to Macao to work as domestic helpers or as security guards in casinos and luxury shops, but they cannot qualify for permanent residency or citizenship – unless they get married to a local.\nAccording to the annual Henley Passport Index, which ranks passports by how many destinations their holders can visit visa-free, Macao has the 33rd most powerful passport in the world, and Portugal is tied for the fifth best. Meanwhile, the Philippines’ passport is ranked 75th.\nRelated article\n‘Like the tart, I never change’: The secret behind Macao’s most famous dessert\nBalocas estimates that about half of Macao’s expat Portuguese population left during the pandemic, as Macao had some of the strictest requirements in the world, including a 21-day quarantine.\nThat’s why he counts on places like Albergue 1601, a restaurant housed in a heritage building from the colonial eral, to keep the city’s Portuguese heritage alive.\n“This neighborhood has the lamps in the street exactly the same as in Lisbon,” he says. “So if you walk around, you almost feel that you are in Lisbon. Sometimes I even joke that you can come here and take some pictures and say that you are in Lisbon without being in Lisbon.”\nHowever, Balocas says that whether you love or hate casinos, it is impossible to ignore them. He sometimes joins a poker game on his day off: “I like to play against people, not machines.”\nHe cites a recent government program that “pairs” casinos with specific local streets and shops and encourages their guests to go there and spend money, as a positive move forward. In his opinion, getting hotel guests to venture outside into Macao – which is densely packed and easy to navigate on foot – helps the whole community.\n“What I want people to explore when they come to Macao, it’s to get out from the casinos, honestly,” says Balocas. “There is a lot to explore. We have beautiful museums, beautiful neighborhoods.”\nThese days, Balocas is working at a hospitality group, managing Albergue 1601.\nWhen he has friends or family in town, he says, the first stop is the Macao Tower observation deck, so they can see just how small and compact the city is.\n“Even nowadays that I’m 11 years here, sometimes I like to get lost. Don’t just explore the center, explore the alleys.”\n",

    "content": "Chanu Gupta has lived in India’s financial capital Mumbai nearly his whole life, since arriving as a child from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.\nBut when polls open in the city, the 59-year-old street vendor won’t be able to vote in the nationwide election – along with millions of internal migrant workers who are a major backbone of the country’s economy.\n“I cannot go vote as I don’t belong to Maharashtra state,” Gupta told CNN in Mumbai’s shopping district Dadar, standing next to the roadside cart where he sells shaved ice and cold drinks. “I have voting rights in another state.”\nUnder India’s election rules, eligible voters can only cast ballots in their constituencies – meaning those working outside of their state have to return home to vote.\nThat’s all but impossible for many out-of-state workers, especially underprivileged daily-wage workers in the unorganized sector. And it’s a huge group – one study estimates there were about 600 million internal migrants in 2020, making up 43% of the country’s nearly 1.4 billion population at the time.\nThese workers are often from poorer rural parts of India, in search of work in bigger cities. Even then, they earn low wages that are usually sent home to support family members.\nPerhaps nowhere is this starker than Mumbai – India’s richest city and the birthplace of the Bollywood movie industry. Often referred to as the “city of dreams,” Mumbai draws migrants from across the country hoping to find wealth and success.\nMore than 43% of Mumbai’s population were classed as migrants in 2011 during the last national census, according to migration think tank Knomad. Many come from states with higher poverty and unemployment rates such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and Gujarat.\nSigns of that diverse mix are everywhere in Mumbai – the varied languages spoken, the many day laborers across the city, from auto-rickshaw drivers to construction workers and sugarcane juice vendors lining the streets.\nFor these workers, forgoing daily wages to head home to vote would come at a high cost – both in the money they would spend getting there, and lost wages. And those losses have a ripple effect on the family members back home dependent on their income – from children missing out on tuition fees to elderly parents’ rent and food costs.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic only underscored the volatility of migrant workers’ circumstances when millions lost their jobs almost overnight and were forced to go home.\n“Despite the living expenses being relatively high in large cities as compared to villages, their wages are considerably low causing poor living conditions including limited or non-existent public services such as water and sanitation,” said one United Nations-led study that examined the impact of the pandemic on this segment of the workforce.\nGupta said his shaved ice business relies on the hot summer months when the election takes place. “If I go to vote, I lose my business. Earning my living is more important to me than voting as I have to support my family,” he said.\n“There are many migrants like me who are in Mumbai to earn money and are not able to vote.”\nMany Indian citizens abroad – part of the massive global Indian diaspora – face the same problem, though their circumstances vary considerably.\nRelated article\nBillions spent, jungle-trekking poll workers and voting at 15,000 feet. What to know about the world’s biggest election\nMost are low-income laborers who helped build the economies and glittering cities of oil-rich Arab nations, while some are middle or upper-class students pursuing an international education or professional career in Western countries.\nAccording to government figures, there are 13.6 million such “non-resident Indians,” or NRIs, globally. The biggest group is in the United Arab Emirates, with 3.4 million NRIs, followed by 2.5 million in Saudi Arabia; next is the United States with 1.2 million.\nThe plight of NRIs in Gulf nations – many of whom live in cramped dormitories and labor camps – was also highlighted during the pandemic when businesses shut down, wages dried up and border restrictions prevented them from returning home, leaving them in limbo.\nFor these overseas Indians, there is no such thing as online voting or postal ballots. Instead, NRIs must register as an “overseas voter” then travel to their hometown in India to be physically present in their constituencies to vote.\nLocal media reports highlight some dedicated voters with the means to fly back and vote, such as professionals in the United Kingdom or Dubai. But they remain a tiny minority of NRIs who do so.\nAccording to the Election Commission of India, in the last national elections in 2019, more than 71,000 people registered as “overseas voters” – less than 1% of the total NRI population at the time.\nIndian authorities have pushed hard in recent years to increase turnout, urging all 968 million eligible voters nationwide to cast their ballots – a massive feat that includes setting up more than a million polling stations from remote forests to mountain peaks.\nThe ECI has also launched voter literacy initiatives and social media campaigns targeting young voters.\nThese efforts saw the highest voter turnout in the country’s history in the 2019 election, with more than 67% of Indians going to the polls.\nThe massive group of disenfranchised migrant workers stands in sharp contrast to these achievements – with no solution in sight.\nIn a 2011 study that surveyed workers across five Indian states, 60% of respondents had “missed voting in elections at least once because they were away from home seeking livelihood options.” It added that many migrants left home as young as age 13 to look for work – and did not have time to get their voter IDs when they became eligible at age 18.\nThe ECI acknowledged this problem in a 2022 report, raising the question of how to improve voter participation among internal migrants.\nOne issue the voting body highlighted was the absence of any clear definition of an internal migrant, adding that their inability to vote is a key reason “contributing to low voter turnout.”\nThe ECI said it had proposed remote voting machines to address the problem. But in 2023, the government said there were no such plans.\nThat means for now, voting remains an unlikely reality for many migrant workers.\n“I cannot say now whom I would vote for if I was in my hometown,” said Gupta, the Mumbai vendor. “That is the last thing on my mind – my focus right now is earning my livelihood.”\n",

    "content": "The home insurance market is crumbling in New Orleans, leaving Alfredo Herrera with few options for coverage — and skyrocketing insurance premiums.\nHerrera, 35, works in finance for a local bank. He bought his 900-square-foot home in New Orleans’ Mid-City neighborhood in 2020 for $270,000, and lives there with his partner.\nIn 2022, he paid $1,600 a year for home insurance. But last July, his insurer canceled his coverage, saying it was leaving Louisiana.\nIn the past, acquiring or keeping homeowners’ insurance didn’t present much of a problem.\nBut as climate change increases the frequency and severity of extreme weather, insurers — especially those in areas most impacted by floods and fires — are raising their premiums, or pulling out altogether, impacting the affordability and availability of home and fire insurance.\nHerrera shopped around for a new plan, but he struggled to find a policy. Louisiana Citizens, the insurer of last resort for property owners in the state, was out of the question. It would have cost more than $7,000 annually.\nHerrera eventually found a policy with a small company in the state that charged him $4,930 annually — a 208% increase from what he paid in 2022.\n“It’s a very difficult situation,” he said. He never imagined that when he bought his home, private insurance options would be this limited and the last resort insurer would be so expensive.\n“We’re against the wall,” Herrera said. “There’s no competition.”\nHerrera’s insurance story is common in Louisiana and other places across the country at increasingly higher risk for extreme weather.\nThere were a record 28 weather and climate disasters with losses totaling over $1 billion last year in America, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. By comparison, between 1980 and 2023, the typical annual average for these events was 8.5.\nA Louisiana State University survey last year found that 17% of Louisiana homeowners reported their provider canceled their policy. Sixty-three percent of policyholders said the cost of their insurance coverage increased from the prior year, the survey found.\nThere was roughly a 10% to 12% increase in homeowners’ insurance costs last year in the United States, said Mark Friedlander, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute, a nonprofit industry association.\nRelated article\nInsurance premiums could surge in these American cities because of climate disasters, new data shows\nThe main drivers are the higher costs insurers face, including from more severe storms; higher replacement costs; and re-insurance, the type of insurance used by insurers to limit their risks. These are passed on to consumers. So even if a homeowner doesn’t live in a high-risk area, that owner is likely paying a higher premium to cover people in the riskiest places.\nIn 2023, Neil Fernandes paid $1,700 a year for Farmers Insurance coverage for his home in Santa Clarita, California, where the 42-year-old software engineer lives with his wife and child.\nBut last year, Farmers said it was raising his premium to $3,200. When he asked why, Farmers cited rising costs and increased fire hazards in the state. Fernandes said the fire hazards around his home haven’t changed and he lives a quarter mile from a fire station.\nHe started shopping around for other policies, but he found limited options.\nFrustrated by the lack of choices, he switched to AAA home insurance for $2,880 a year.\nHe and his family have had to change their lifestyle to cover the increase. He’s driving less to save on car insurance. They aren’t eating out as much, or traveling, and are putting off home improvement upgrades.\nFernandes is challenging AAA’s assessment of his home insurance value, which he said is over-estimated.\nAAA did not comment to CNN.\nAnd he worries about more home insurance price shocks in the future, something he did not anticipate when he bought his home.\n“As a home owner, I always worry about things like paying taxes for good schools and community upkeep,” he said. “Now I have to worry about insurance coverage.”\nIn some places most exposed to climate change, insurers have stopped issuing policies.\nIn May, State Farm, the largest home insurer in California, announced it would pause issuing policies in that state, citing wildfire risks. Farmers Insurance deemed it too risky to continue insuring homes in Florida and pulled out of the market there entirely.\nOn March 20, State Farm said it would not renew 72,000 home insurance policies in California, representing just over 2% of the company’s policies in the state. The company cited “inflation, catastrophe exposure [and] reinsurance costs” among the reasons.\nMore people are being driven to the state-supported “insurer of last resort,” where they typically have to pay more money for a narrower policy.\nMore states are looking to start state-backed insurance providers as companies pull out.\nIn Florida, Citizens Property Insurance has seen the number of policies it has issued rise about 50% in the last year alone to 1.3 million — equal to 16% of the market and far more than any national insurer writes in the state.\nThe US Senate Budget Committee is launching an investigation into whether Florida’s state-backed home and property insurance company has enough money in the bank to withstand future disasters.\nBut climate change isn’t the only factor driving up costs. Insurance companies also point to the rising cost of replacing homes, as inflation for building supplies and labor has soared.\nThe insurance industry says that rebuilding and replacement costs surged 55% between 2019 and 2022. Costs have since fallen, however. And reinsurance has gone up between 30% and 40% after years of losses in the industry, according to Matthew Carletti, an insurance industry analyst for JMP Securities.\nHomeowners who have a mortgage are not able to go without homeowners insurance as their mortgage servicer will require an escrow account for insurance. But for those who have paid off their home or bought it with cash, the high additional costs of homeowners insurance and the challenge of getting it can lead some to take their chances without it.\nSome 6 million homeowners chose to forgo homeowners insurance, according to a report from the Consumer Federation of America. That’s about 7.4% of all homeowners in the country, and amounts to about $1.6 trillion of unprotected value.\nCFA warned that the problem of uninsured homes is likely to get worse in coming years unless major investments in climate change adaptation and stronger oversight of the insurance industry are made.\nDiana Troxell and her husband are not sure how they will pay for their 250% annual premium increase for their manufactured home in rural Cottonwood, California. Right now, they are getting help from family to pay for groceries and gas.\nTroxell, 76, works seasonally as a face painter at the county fair. She and her husband rely primarily on Social Security to scrape by.\nThey have lived in their home for 19 years and had a policy with Foremost Insurance, paying about $1,910 a year.\nBut Foremost last year told them their policy would not be renewed due to wildfire exposure.\n“We went into a shock mode,” she said. “We couldn’t figure out what to do.”\nThey looked to sell their home and rent in California, but they couldn’t afford it.\nWith no other insurance options available, they turned to California FAIR Plan, a state program for residents and businesses who can’t obtain insurance through a regular insurance company. In 2021, the FAIR Plan accounted for 3% of the state’s policies in 2021, nearly double the share from 2018.\nNow they are paying about $6,660 a year through the FAIR plan.\n“We’re in ‘how are we going to do this’ mode?” she said. “We’re living month to month.”\nCNN’s Ella Nilsen contributed to this article.\n",

    "content": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex embarked on what was officially dubbed a 3-day private visit to Nigeria, yet it unfolded with all the grandeur and attention typically reserved for royal tours.\nTheir first day saw them receive a red-carpet welcome complete with cultural dancers following their arrival in the Nigerian capital of Abuja, where they kicked off a multi-day mental health summit at Lightway Academy.\nThere, they also unveiled a partnership between their Archewell Foundation and the GEANCO Foundation to provide students with school supplies and menstrual products.\nThe pair had been invited to the West African nation by the country’s highest-ranking military official, Christopher Musa. After meeting him at the Nigerian Defence Headquarters, Meghan signed a guest book thanking officials for “welcoming me home.”\nDespite the private nature of their visit, the couple’s itinerary resembled previous official tours they carried out before stepping back as senior working royals in 2020.\nThey were warmly received everywhere they went, with Nigerians showcasing their famed hospitality. The couple were showered with gifts, including a touching portrait of a young Harry with his mum.\nFor both Nigeria and the Sussexes, this visit held significant weight.\nIt was an opportunity for Nigeria to demonstrate its capability to host such high-profile guests and dispel any doubts raised by skeptics, especially considering the country’s standing in the eyes of the UK’s Foreign Office as one of the most dangerous countries to visit in the world.\nNigeria has security issues with a terrorist insurgency in the northeast and northwest. However, it is a huge country —  larger than the US state of Texas  — and the other areas visited by the royal couple over the past several days are relatively safe.\nRelated article\n‘We love you’: Harry plays volleyball with army veterans as he and Meghan get warm welcome in Nigeria\nMeanwhile, for Prince Harry and Meghan, this marked their first major trip to Africa since relinquishing their official royal duties.\nIt was a chance for them to engage in a hearts-and-minds charm offensive, which they executed with aplomb.\nMeghan, in particular, embraced exploring her Nigerian ancestry after discovering several years ago that she is 43% Nigerian through a genealogy test.\nOn Saturday, she co-hosted a women’s leadership event with Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director-General of the World Trade Organisation, for about 50 leading women from across Nigerian society and politics, business, media, and culture.\nDuring a panel discussion, moderated by Nigerian media mogul Mo Abudu, the duchess spoke passionately about uncovering her Nigerian roots and its significance to her own identity.\nShe described Nigeria as “my country,” adding that “being African American, part of it is not knowing so much about your lineage or background, where you come from specifically. And it was exciting … to discover more and understand what that really means.”\nIt was here that Meghan’s natural ability to connect really shone through. She chatted effortlessly with attendees, posed for selfies and engaged in heartfelt conversations.\nAt another event on Sunday at the prestigious Delborough Hotel in Lagos - where the great and good of Nigerian society had gathered to welcome the coupl -  she appeared visibly moved when three powerful traditional rulers honored her with royal titles.\nThe Obi of Onitsha, His Majesty Igwe Nnaemeka Alfred Ugochukwu Achebe christened Meghan “Ada Mazi,” which means “the daughter of the Igbo ancestral palace.”\nWhile, the Oluwo of Iwoland, southwest, Nigeria, Oba Abdulrasheed Adewale Akanbi christened her with the Yoruba name of “Adetokunbo” which means “royalty from across the seas.”\nTheir engagements during the three-day visit were centered around their core passions: sports rehabilitation, mental health, and women’s empowerment.\nFor Harry’s part, the duke demonstrated his compassion and connection to his late mother, Princess Diana, as he visited wounded soldiers at a military hospital in Kaduna, 150 miles from Abuja.\nHis first stop was to drop in on the governor of Kaduna state, Senator Uba Sani, where he was again welcomed by a troupe of dancers and a red carpet. Governor Sani sat opposite him and praised Harry as a “symbol of courage and “praised his service to his country.”\nHe added, “Please give our regards to the Duchess of Sussex, Princess Meghan.”\nHarry toured about six wards and met young men recuperating from their injuries. Many had been shot, ambushed by Boko Haram or lost limbs due to blasts. One moment captured by a photographer showing Harry holding a wounded soldier lying on the hospital bed during the visit resonated deeply and went viral on social media.\nCorporal Yusef, 23, who had been shot through the knee, spoke with the duke, who asked him about his rehab. “Are you going to try for the Invictus Games team? Are you preparing for that?… We will see you there,” Harry suggested.\nTheir visit also extended to cultural experiences, such as witnessing a vibrant dance performance and a polo match at the historic Lagos Polo Club.\nPolo holds special significance for Harry and the event provided a platform to showcase his longstanding commitment to the sport and its charitable endeavors.\nAmid the festivities, the couple expressed gratitude for Nigeria’s warm reception. As they bid farewell to Nigeria, Meghan declared: “I can’t wait to come back!”\n",

    "content": "Editor’s note: Dana Santas, known as the “Mobility Maker,” is a certified strength and conditioning specialist and mind-body coach in professional sports, and is the author of the book “Practical Solutions for Back Pain Relief.”\nWhen it comes to cardiovascular fitness, you may tend to focus on activities that move you forward, such as walking, running and cycling.\nLikewise, in weight training, most traditional exercises center on forward and backward motion, occurring in what’s known as the sagittal plane.\nBut there is another plane of movement that deserves your attention: the frontal plane, where movements go from side to side.\nIf the majority of your workouts take place in the sagittal plane, you risk creating muscular imbalances and leaving yourself susceptible to injury during lateral movements in everyday life. Incorporating frontal plane exercises, such as the side lunge, into your fitness routine can prepare your body to move better and be more durable in daily-life activities.\nThe side or lateral lunge is one of the best exercises for building lateral stability and mobility in the often neglected frontal plane. This exercise strengthens the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, adductors and core to help protect you against injuries such as groin pulls and hamstring tears. The side lunge also improves the mobility and stability of your hips, knees and ankles to avoid related strains and sprains.\nRelated article\nStretching isn’t always the answer for pain and muscle tension\nConsider the activities in your lifestyle that require you to move laterally and how side lunging could prove beneficial:\nNavigating crowded spaces: In environments such as busy streets, shopping malls or public transportation, you often need to sidestep or maneuver laterally to avoid obstacles, step off curbs and move through tight spaces. Training with side lunges can improve your ability to navigate these environments.\nHousehold chores: Tasks such as vacuuming, sweeping or mopping often require lateral motion as you move from side to side to clean different areas of your home. By strengthening the muscles involved in lateral movement with side lunges, you can accomplish these chores more efficiently while reducing your risk of muscle strain or injury.\nPlaying with children or pets: If you have kids or pets, you’re likely familiar with the need to move quickly and react to sudden changes in direction. Side lunges can improve your ability to change direction rapidly and maintain balance, helping to keep playtime pain-free.\nRecreational sports: Many recreational sports, including pickleball, tennis and basketball, involve lateral movements such as shuffling, cutting and sidestepping. Incorporating side lunges into your training regimen can enhance your lateral quickness, agility and overall performance in these sports.\nOutdoor activities: Whether you’re hiking on uneven terrain, walking in deep sand on the beach or participating in more extreme activities such as skiing or snowboarding, lateral stability and mobility are essential for navigating varied landscapes and maintaining balance. Training with side lunges can increase your lateral movement strength, enhance your mobility and boost your confidence to be more adventurous outdoors.\nRelated article\nDo these exercises for core strength if you can’t stomach doing planks\nEditor’s note: Consult your doctor before beginning any new exercise program. Stop immediately if you experience pain.\n1. Stand tall with your feet hip-width apart and toes pointed forward.\n2. With your hands on your hips or clasped in front of your chest, take a wide step to the side with your right foot, while your left foot remains firmly grounded.\n3. Bend your right knee to 90 degrees, aligned above your ankle, while pushing your hips back.\n4. Your left leg remains straight with both feet pointing forward.\n5. Although you will naturally hinge at your hips as you sit back, try not to lean forward too much. Keep your chest up as much as possible with your back neutral.\n6. You do not need to hold the side-lunge position for more than a second or two. Get into the position and then push through your right heel to return to the starting position.\n7. Repeat for 10 to 12 reps total on each side through two to three sets.\nDepending on your fitness level, you can lower or increase the suggested repetitions and set totals. I recommend adding side lunges to your workout routine at least twice weekly for best results.\nIf you don’t have the strength or mobility to step wide to the side or bend your knee all the way to 90 degrees, shorten your stance and/or how far you sit back and bend your knee. You can slowly increase your stance as you get stronger and more mobile.\nIf you struggle with strength or balance in this exercise, you can place an armless chair behind you on the side you are lunging, enabling you to sit back on the chair seat during each repetition. Also, if you have access to a suspension trainer, you can hold the straps for stability as you perform the exercise.\nRelated article\n6 exercises that address an often overlooked key to longevity\nTo increase the intensity, you can increase the speed of your repetitions.\nYou can make the exercise more dynamic with a greater focus on agility by alternating back and forth with a small jump in between as you shift from side to side.\nYou can also add weight by holding a kettlebell or dumbbell at chest height. Use the appropriate weight for your fitness level.\nRemember, moving laterally is a natural part of daily function, so incorporating side lunges into your workouts not only adds variety, it also plays a crucial role in enhancing your ability to move well and prevent injury. Next time you hit the gym or feel the need to move your body, remember your side lunges to unlock the full potential of your frontal plane fitness.\n",

    "content": "In the vast deserts of North Africa, a new city featuring the tallest tower on the continent and the largest cathedral in the Middle East is taking shape.\nThirty miles east of Cairo, Egypt, the temporarily named New Administrative Capital (NAC), initiated by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, aims to accommodate a significant portion of Egypt's growing population, now exceeding 105 million.\nExclusive imagery provided to Newsweek by Maxar Technologies shows the state of construction on the new government district, a project designed to transfer Cairo's administrative and economic heartbeat to a more modern and sustainable environment.\nAmong the city's cultural and architectural highlights are a 70-story tower — already the tallest in Africa — alongside religious sites including the Middle East's largest cathedral and a grand mosque.\nThe development plan also includes the Green River Park, envisioned as a vast urban oasis double the size of New York's Central Park, and The Octagon, intended to be the new, expansive headquarters for Egypt's Ministry of Defense. The Capital International Airport is designed to ease congestion at Cairo's airports and serve as a new regional hub.\nThe Egypt International Olympic City, still in the planning stages, aims to host major international sports events with facilities like the New Administrative Capital Stadium, which will be the largest stadium in Egypt.\nThe NAC has yet to be given a formal name. A competition was launched on the new capital's website to choose a new name and logo for the city. No official results have yet been announced.\nSome government functions have already started the transition from Cairo to the NAC. Khaled Abbas, chairman of the Administrative Capital for Urban Development (ACUD), told CNN last month there are already 48,000 government employees working in the NAC, mostly commuting from greater Cairo via a new electric rail line. Officials hope to eventually centralize Cairo's government and business districts in the area, which will be run by a system of A.I.-powered technologies to optimize utilities, trash collection and the flow of traffic.\nThe NAC is gradually coming to life, with more than 1,500 families already relocated, according to Abbas. By the end of this year, he expects the number to rise to 10,000. The city is projected to house five million residents, taking some of the pressure off Cairo, the congested and polluted capital home to 22 million people.\nStill, there are concerns the NAC will not live up to its promise of being a livable option for vast swaths of Egyptians, with some Cairo residents telling Reuters they \"cannot afford to live in the new city.\" Egypt is notorious for developing new cities in its deserts, promising to alleviate the overcrowded capital. New Cairo, a satellite city established in 2000 was built to house as many as five million people. As of 2017, fewer than 300,000 people lived within its confines.\nEstimated to cost up to $60 billion over four phases of development — with much of the cost shouldered by the Egyptian military — some critics have questioned whether the NAC is an appropriate use of funds. Egypt is facing one of its worst financial crises in decades, and the economy is largely being held up by international loans.\nBut with phase one all but complete and construction on phase two scheduled to begin this year, the NAC is already further along than many of the world's other megaprojects. In Indonesia, where a similar development is in the process of creating an entirely new capital to replace the congested and sinking city of Jakarta, not a single building has yet to be competed despite a grand ribbon-cutting set for this summer.\n",

    "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\nGeorge Mallory is renowned for being one of the first British mountaineers to attempt to scale the dizzying heights of Mount Everest during the 1920s — until the mountain claimed his life.\nNearly a century later, newly digitized letters shed light on Mallory’s hopes and fears about ascending Everest, leading up to the last days before he disappeared while heading for its peak.\nOn June 8, 1924, Mallory and fellow climber Andrew Irvine departed from their expedition team in a push for the summit; they were never seen alive again.\nMallory’s words, however, are now available to read online in their entirety for the first time. Magdalene College, Cambridge, where Mallory studied as an undergraduate from 1905 to 1908, recently digitized hundreds of pages of correspondence and other documents written and received by him.\nOver the past 18 months, archivists scanned the documents in preparation for the centennial of Mallory’s disappearance. The college will display a selection of Mallory’s letters and possessions in the exhibit “George Mallory: Magdalene to the Mountain,” opening June 20.\nThe Everest letters outline Mallory’s meticulous preparations and equipment tests, and his optimism about their prospects. But the letters also show the darker side of mountaineering: bad weather, health issues, setbacks and doubts.\nDays before his disappearance, Mallory wrote that the odds were “50 to 1 against us” in the last letter to his wife, Ruth, dated May 27, 1924.\n“This has been a bad time altogether,” Mallory wrote. “I look back on tremendous efforts & exhaustion & dismal looking out of a tent door and onto a world of snow & vanishing hopes.”\nHe went on to describe a harrowing brush with death during a recent climb, when the ground beneath his feet collapsed, leaving him suspended “half-blind & breathless,” his weight supported only by his ice axe wedged across a crevasse as he dangled over “a very unpleasant black hole.”\nOther letters Mallory exchanged with Ruth were written at the time of their courtship, while he was serving in Britain’s artillery regiment during World War I. Throughout his travels, correspondence from Ruth provided him with much-needed stability during the most challenging times, said project lead Katy Green, a college archivist at Magdalene College.\n“She was the ‘rock’ at home, he says himself in his letters,” Green said. The archivist recounted one note in which Mallory told Ruth: “I’m so glad that you never wobble, because I would wobble without you.”\nYet while Mallory was clearly devoted to his wife, he nonetheless repeatedly returned to the Himalayas despite her mounting fears for his safety.\n“There’s something in him that drove him,” Green said. “It might have been his wartime experience, or it might have just been the sort of person that he was.”\nIn total, the collection includes around 840 letters spanning from 1914 to 1924; Ruth wrote about 440 of those to Mallory, offering an unprecedented and highly detailed view of daily life for women in the early 20th century, Green told CNN.\nTogether, the letters offer readers a rare glimpse of the man behind the legend, said Jochen Hemmleb, an author and alpinist who was part of the Everest expedition that found Mallory’s body in 1999.\n“They are really personal. They are documents of his character. They provide unique insights into his life, and especially into the 1924 expedition — his state of mind, his accurate planning, his ambitions,” said Hemmleb, who was not involved in the scanning project. “It’s such a treasure that these are now digitized and available for everyone to read.”\nThree of the digitized letters — written to Mallory by his brother, his sister and a family friend — were recovered from Mallory’s body by the Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition, which ascended Everest seeking the remains of Mallory and Irvine.\nOn May 1, 1999, expedition member and mountaineer Conrad Anker found a frozen corpse at an altitude of around 26,700 feet (8,138 meters) and identified it as Mallory’s from a name tag that was sewn into his clothes.\nMallory’s body was interred where it lay at the family’s request, said Anker, who was not involved in the letter digitizing project.\n“Having done body recoveries in other places, it’s very laborious, and it’s very dangerous at that altitude,” he told CNN. “We collected some of his personal effects that went back to the Royal Geographical Society,” including the three letters that were later scanned at Magdalene College.\nMount Everest, the highest peak in the Himalayan mountain range, is also the tallest mountain on Earth, rising 29,035 feet (8,850 meters) above sea level on the border between Nepal and Tibet — an autonomous region in China. Its Tibetan name is Chomolungma, meaning “Goddess Mother of the World,” and its Nepali name is Sagarmatha, meaning “Goddess of the Sky.”\nHowever, these names were unknown to 19th century British surveyors who mapped the region, and in 1865 the Royal Geographical Society named the peak Mount Everest after British surveyor Sir George Everest, a former surveyor general of India.\nMallory participated in all three of Britain’s first forays onto Everest’s slopes: in 1921, 1922 and 1924. When he vanished in 1924, he was less than two weeks shy of his 38th birthday.\nMany have speculated about whether Mallory and Irvine managed to reach Everest’s summit. The climbers were last seen in the early afternoon of June 8 by expedition member and geologist Noel Odell, who was following behind and glimpsed them from a distance. Odell later found some of their equipment at a campsite, but there was no trace of Mallory and Irvine.\nRelated article\n‘You will be shocked what you can pull off.’ Lessons on achieving your dreams from women who did\n“(Mallory) risked a lot despite the fact that he had a family back home and three small children,” Hemmleb said. “We don’t know whether it was really irresponsible to make that final attempt, because we don’t really know what happened. It could be that in the end, he simply had bad luck.”\nDecades after Mallory’s death, Sherpa Tenzing Norgay and New Zealand mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary became the first to reach Everest’s peak, summiting on May 29, 1953. In the years that followed, thousands attempted to climb Everest, with nearly 4,000 people reaching its summit. More than 330 climbers have died trying since modern records were kept, according to the Himalayan Database, which compiles records of all expeditions in the Himalayas; some of those bodies remain on the mountain, frozen where they fell and visible to climbers who pass them by.\n“If you’re out in this environment, you make peace with your own mortality and the deaths of others,” Anker said. “You’re above 8,000 meters, and when there are weather changes or your own systems cease to function due to the lack of oxygen, it gets serious really quickly.”\nRelated article\nMount Everest: Nepal to remove trash and dead bodies from world’s tallest mountain\nWhen mountaineers are close to a mountain’s summit, they sometimes proceed even under dangerous conditions due to so-called summit fever, a compulsion to reach the peak even at the cost of their own safety. It’s unknown whether Mallory was in the grip of summit fever when he died, but he might have thought that his reputation depended on summiting.\n“That was going to be the defining moment in his life,” Anker said.\nBy comparison, Mallory’s team member Edward Norton had attempted to summit four days earlier but turned back at roughly the same altitude where Mallory and Irvine were seen for the last time.\n“I had a conversation with one of Edward Norton’s sons a couple of years ago,” Hemmleb said. “When I asked him, do you think it was mere luck that your father survived and Mallory died? He said, ‘No, I think there was one difference: My father, Edward Norton, didn’t need the mountain.’”\nAs a climber himself, Hemmleb took that message to heart.\n“That is something I personally learned from Mallory,” he said. “You need to be very careful not to make yourself dependent on that summit success.”\nRelated article\nNepal to require all Mount Everest climbers to use a tracking chip\nA century has elapsed since Mallory’s death, but the digitizing of these letters assures that his story will keep being told, Hemmleb said.\n“This will continue beyond my own lifetime, I’m certain of that,” he added. “In a sense, it’s the expedition that never ends.”\nMindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine.\nCorrection: A previous version of this story misstated the nationality of Sir Edmund Hillary and, in a caption, the location of the base camp where Mallory and Irvine were last photographed.\n",

    "content": "A step onto the podium. A medal draped over your head and a flag raised in your honor. Music. Tears of joy and relief as years of hard work come to fruition.\nReceiving a first Olympic medal is supposed to be a momentous and exhilarating occasion for every athlete but not Alysia Montaño.\nIt was late at night in Cleveland this year when the American athlete was informed that her fourth-place finish at the 2012 Olympics is set to be upgraded to bronze. Alone in a hotel room, thousands of miles from home, her initial emotions were only emptiness and loss.\nThis should have come 12 years earlier, in a packed stadium with her family sitting proudly in the stands. Instead, all Montaño could do was lie down and stare vacantly at the ceiling as the hours drifted by.\n“A stab in the gut, in the heart, really,” is how she describes her supposed moment of triumph. “I kind of felt a sinking feeling, to be honest.”\nMontaño initially placed fifth in the women’s 800-meter final in London, about half a second outside the medal positions having led the race bravely through the first lap.\nIn front of her were two Russian athletes – Mariya Savinova, who had streaked away from the rest of the field on the final straight, and Ekaterina Guliyev (then known as Ekaterina Poistogova), who narrowly edged out Kenya’s Pamela Jelimo for bronze.\nBoth Savinova and Guliyev were identified in a 2015 report, commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), as having benefitted from Russia’s state-sponsored doping program, though Montaño’s performance at the London Olympics is only just now receiving the recognition it deserves.\nSavinova was stripped of her gold medal in 2017, while Guliyev is also set to lose her silver, upgraded from bronze, after the Athletics Integrity Unit announced this month that her results from July 17, 2012 to October 20, 2014 would be disqualified.\nGuliyev, now competing for Turkey under her husband’s surname, has been given a two-year ban and has until May 13 to appeal the decision.\nShe has previously served another two-year ban for doping violations, voiding her results back to October 2015, and attempted to argue in a tribunal that there was no evidence to bring further charges against her. CNN has contacted the Turkish Athletic Federation for further comment.\nIn the days after learning that she could be awarded a bronze medal, Montaño says that her emotions oscillated from joy to sadness to something akin to grief.\nHer despair is at its lowest when she thinks of her grandmother, who turned 100 days before the 800-meter final in London and celebrated by watching the race from a hospital bed, never to know that Montaño’s fifth place would later be upgraded.\n“You can’t ever get that back,” the 38-year-old Montaño explains. “The loss is history lost; the loss is the moment lost; the loss is the people who were there to hug you and cheer for you; the loss is the homecoming parade. These things are very real.”\nThis is not a new situation for Montaño, who was retrospectively awarded bronze medals for her performances at the 2011 and 2013 world championships after Savinova was stripped of gold in both races.\nWhile competing, she says that she was suspicious of her Russian rivals, partly after observing a sharp and unprecedented improvement in some athletes’ results and partly from the ease with which they would pass her on the track.\n“It’s like you’re running against robots,” says Montaño. “When you get beaten by a competitor, you can feel the huff and the puff of the two of you kind of going at it, or the three of you going at it.\n“Sticking your neck out there for just a second of time, or a millisecond of time, and it just isn’t the same way. Anybody can go and watch those videos [of past races] and see: this is wild.”\nIn 2019, six and eight years after winning her two world championship medals, Montaño and her family – her husband, parents and children – were invited to Doha in Qatar for a staging of the medal ceremonies she never had.\nBut the crowd in the stadium was scant and the accompanying fireworks display, she thought, was underwhelming, making her feel “even more empty.”\nNow, Montaño hopes to receive her Olympic medal at the 2028 Games in Los Angeles, with family, friends, supporters and sponsors there to see the moment – unlike American shot putter Adam Nelson, who was handed his gold medal next to a Burger King, nine years later than intended due to a rival’s doping violation.\nShe also wants to recoup some of the financial losses she incurred by being denied an Olympic medal, and one of her current sponsors, Clif Bar, has already agreed to pay Montaño an undisclosed financial bonus for finishing third in 2012, even though she partnered with the company after the London Olympics.\nBased on the contracts she had at the time, Montaño estimates that she has missed out on payments amounting to “well over seven figures.”\nHowever, the true sum is impossible to quantify; winning a medal at a major championship, she explains, increases an athlete’s potential earnings when it comes to negotiating appearance fees or future contracts.\n“Even now, I walk into a conversation and folks run through your accolades and you know the difference between being a medalist and not being one is a huge pay cut,” says Montaño.\n“It’s like anybody who walks into a job interview and their experience gets them a difference with what their compensation is going to be. Coming off [the 2011 world championships] and being a bronze medalist, my bargaining power would have been through the roof,” she added.\nShe believes that some athletes competing at this year’s Paris Olympics will end up suffering a similar fate to her – potentially being robbed of their moment on the podium and in the spotlight – and wants to see harsher punishments introduced for those found guilty of doping offenses.\n“We need to have a much more difficult pathway for athletes who use performance-enhancing drugs to re-enter the sport,” says Montaño.\n“We also have to have much heavier repercussions, I think, from a financial aspect for athletes who choose to dope … There needs to be heavy fines, especially if you want to re-enter the sport. And right now, there’s not enough repercussion.”\nRelated article\nChinese swimmers head to Paris Olympics under a cloud amid row over handling of drugs tests\nCNN has contacted the International Olympic Committee and the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee about athletes being compensated if they are awarded a medal retrospectively.\nMissing out on medals and potential earnings has contributed towards what Montaño describes as a sense of “isolation” from the sport of track and field during a career beset with challenges.\nIn 2019, she told the New York Times that Nike said it would pause her contract and stop paying her if she wanted to have a baby, prompting the company to later adjust its maternity policy so that female athletes wouldn’t be “adversely impacted financially for pregnancy” for 18 months, which was six months more than the previous policy.\n“I definitely have felt a lot of trauma around the track and competing in the sport,” says Montaño, having last competed in an elite race in 2017.\nBut her love for running remains undiminished. She still enjoys heading out on the roads and trails and strongly believes that the sport provides a powerful, positive influence, especially when it comes to her own struggles and frustrations.\n“I feel like I leave all of that stuff behind once I lace up and I get going,” says Montaño. “Once my adrenaline starts rushing and my blood starts coursing through my body and my heart starts pumping, my head gains clarity.”\nAs for the prospect of being awarded an Olympic medal, 2028 will be a full 16 years after she raced in London and crossed the line in a state of exhaustion – an extraordinary and often painful expanse of time.\nFor Montaño, the moment should at least offer some sort of closure.\n“I’m hopeful that it’ll feel like a chapter on which we can turn a page,” she says, “instead of being stuck on the same sentence.”\n",

And it’s a huge group – one study estimates there were about 600 million internal migrants in 2020, making up 43% of the country’s nearly 1.4 billion population at the time.\nThese workers are often from poorer rural parts of India, in search of work in bigger cities. Even then, they earn low wages that are usually sent home to support family members.\nPerhaps nowhere is this starker than Mumbai – India’s richest city and the birthplace of the Bollywood movie industry. Often referred to as the “city of dreams,” Mumbai draws migrants from across the country hoping to find wealth and success.\nMore than 43% of Mumbai’s population were classed as migrants in 2011 during the last national census, according to migration think tank Knomad. Many come from states with higher poverty and unemployment rates such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and Gujarat.\nSigns of that diverse mix are everywhere in Mumbai – the varied languages spoken, the many day laborers across the city, from auto-rickshaw drivers to construction workers and sugarcane juice vendors lining the streets.\nFor these workers, forgoing daily wages to head home to vote would come at a high cost – both in the money they would spend getting there, and lost wages. And those losses have a ripple effect on the family members back home dependent on their income – from children missing out on tuition fees to elderly parents’ rent and food costs.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic only underscored the volatility of migrant workers’ circumstances when millions lost their jobs almost overnight and were forced to go home.\n“Despite the living expenses being relatively high in large cities as compared to villages, their wages are considerably low causing poor living conditions including limited or non-existent public services such as water and sanitation,” said one United Nations-led study that examined the impact of the pandemic on this segment of the workforce.\nGupta said his shaved ice business relies on the hot summer months when the election takes place. “If I go to vote, I lose my business. Earning my living is more important to me than voting as I have to support my family,” he said.\n“There are many migrants like me who are in Mumbai to earn money and are not able to vote.”\nMany Indian citizens abroad – part of the massive global Indian diaspora – face the same problem, though their circumstances vary considerably.\nRelated article\nBillions spent, jungle-trekking poll workers and voting at 15,000 feet. What to know about the world’s biggest election\nMost are low-income laborers who helped build the economies and glittering cities of oil-rich Arab nations, while some are middle or upper-class students pursuing an international education or professional career in Western countries.\nAccording to government figures, there are 13.6 million such “non-resident Indians,” or NRIs, globally. The biggest group is in the United Arab Emirates, with 3.4 million NRIs, followed by 2.5 million in Saudi Arabia; next is the United States with 1.2 million.\nThe plight of NRIs in Gulf nations – many of whom live in cramped dormitories and labor camps – was also highlighted during the pandemic when businesses shut down, wages dried up and border restrictions prevented them from returning home, leaving them in limbo.\nFor these overseas Indians, there is no such thing as online voting or postal ballots. Instead, NRIs must register as an “overseas voter” then travel to their hometown in India to be physically present in their constituencies to vote.\nLocal media reports highlight some dedicated voters with the means to fly back and vote, such as professionals in the United Kingdom or Dubai. But they remain a tiny minority of NRIs who do so.\nAccording to the Election Commission of India, in the last national elections in 2019, more than 71,000 people registered as “overseas voters” – less than 1% of the total NRI population at the time.\nIndian authorities have pushed hard in recent years to increase turnout, urging all 968 million eligible voters nationwide to cast their ballots – a massive feat that includes setting up more than a million polling stations from remote forests to mountain peaks.\nThe ECI has also launched voter literacy initiatives and social media campaigns targeting young voters.\nThese efforts saw the highest voter turnout in the country’s history in the 2019 election, with more than 67% of Indians going to the polls.\nThe massive group of disenfranchised migrant workers stands in sharp contrast to these achievements – with no solution in sight.\nIn a 2011 study that surveyed workers across five Indian states, 60% of respondents had “missed voting in elections at least once because they were away from home seeking livelihood options.” It added that many migrants left home as young as age 13 to look for work – and did not have time to get their voter IDs when they became eligible at age 18.\nThe ECI acknowledged this problem in a 2022 report, raising the question of how to improve voter participation among internal migrants.\nOne issue the voting body highlighted was the absence of any clear definition of an internal migrant, adding that their inability to vote is a key reason “contributing to low voter turnout.”\nThe ECI said it had proposed remote voting machines to address the problem. But in 2023, the government said there were no such plans.\nThat means for now, voting remains an unlikely reality for many migrant workers.\n“I cannot say now whom I would vote for if I was in my hometown,” said Gupta, the Mumbai vendor. “That is the last thing on my mind – my focus right now is earning my livelihood.”\n",

    "content": "The United Kingdom does not feed itself, relying heavily on the European Union for fresh fruit and vegetables. That dependency has changed little since Britain left the bloc in 2020, and could now mean more pain for consumers and small businesses.\nTuesday marks the beginning of the long-delayed introduction of post-Brexit physical inspections of plant and animal imports from the EU. The spot checks will apply initially to products such as meat, cheese and some fish, and eventually to a range of vegetables and fruit.\nHefty new charges on some imported food products will also come into effect, threatening to reduce consumer choice and push up prices not long after UK food inflation fell from double-digit rates. The measures coincide with dire warnings about the possibility of price rises for bread and beer because of the impact of unprecedented rainfall on British grain harvests.\nThe new regime for food imports is perhaps the starkest example of the painful border bureaucracy that UK and EU businesses must contend with in the wake of Brexit.\nBefore leaving the EU, Britain enjoyed unencumbered access to the vast array of food produced in neighboring countries: cheese from France, peaches from Spain, artichokes from Italy. A steady stream of EU agricultural workers, meanwhile, was a boon to British farmers.\nIn the post-Brexit world, Britain’s food supply is more vulnerable to external shocks, even as related labor shortages have at times forced local farmers to leave crops rotting because of a lack of workers to harvest them.\nRelated article\nLast-minute Brexit bill risks higher food prices, UK business groups warn\nUK industry groups say the additional red tape could mean thousands of pounds in extra costs each month for a typical business, while hold-ups at the border will reduce the shelf-life of perishable products and increase food waste.\nEddie Price, the director of the Birmingham Wholesale Market, which houses around 50 businesses selling meat, vegetables, fish, and flowers, says traders are worried about higher costs and delays at the border.\n“There are concerns that (the food) will probably get held up at the point of entry for a couple of days and potentially reduce the value of the product and make it less available,” he told CNN. “There is a real concern, particularly among the larger importers, that it could add several percentage points to their costs.”\nThe UK government insists the new controls are crucial to ensure biosecurity and that checks will be phased in “in a sensible and controlled way,” with the focus initially on the “highest-risk goods,” a category that includes live animals.\n“It is important to remember the cost of our border checks is negligible compared to the impact of a major disease outbreak on our economy and farmers,” a government spokesperson said earlier this month.\nThe government estimates the new checks will cost British businesses about £330 million ($419 million) annually and increase food inflation by about 0.2 percentage points over three years.\nBut the Cold Chain Federation, which represents businesses delivering goods that need chilled storage, has come up with a much larger sum. It calculates that the new border measures could easily add more than £1 billion ($1.3 billion) a year in costs to firms trading perishable produce, even before fruit and vegetables, which are likely to face fewer checks, are included.\nAn additional cost of that scale will “significantly increase food prices and reduce choice,” the federation’s CEO Phil Pluck wrote in a letter to environment and food minister Steve Barclay earlier this month.\n“We also believe that this will seriously threaten the viability of small and medium-sized enterprises operating within food retail, such as small garden centres, restaurants, and delicatessens,” he added.\nThe British Retail Consortium, which represents major supermarkets among other retailers, is less concerned about the potential impact on food prices. Any additional cost from new checks and paperwork is “likely to be small relative to the £200 billion of food sales in the UK each year, meaning it is unlikely to result in any large price rises,” according to the organization’s director of food and sustainability Andrew Opie.\n“However, it is vital that border checks run smoothly when they are introduced in April to avoid any risk of delays or availability issues,” he cautioned in a statement.\nIt won’t help that trucks arriving from the EU through the Port of Dover and the undersea Eurotunnel, which handle the majority of UK food imports, will be directed 22 miles (35 kilometers) inland for physical checks at a different facility.\nAround half of the food on British plates is imported, mainly from the EU ﻿— the Netherlands, France, Ireland and Germany are the biggest suppliers. Warmer Italy and Spain are also essential providers of fresh produce, particularly as UK shoppers are used to being able to buy virtually any type of food all year found.\nIn 2022, almost 40% of fresh vegetables consumed in the UK came from the EU, according to official figures. Some 53% was produced locally and the rest was imported from other countries.\nWhen it comes to fruit, only 16% is produced domestically, with 28% sourced from the EU and 56% from the rest of the world.\nThis heavy reliance on food from other countries was thrown into the spotlight in February last year, when poor weather in Spain and North Africa caused shortages in Britain, leading supermarkets to impose purchase limits on some staple items, including tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers.\nIn an article in Nature published in June 2020, academics from the University of York in England argued that Britain is “dangerously dependent” on the Netherlands and Spain for the “lion’s share” of its fresh vegetable imports. “The degree to which this dependence can be sustained after Brexit is a moot point, to say the least,” they wrote.\nBut Jack Bobo, director of the Food Systems Institute at the University of Nottingham in England, says a reliance on imports doesn’t make a food system inherently more vulnerable. “There are risks either way,” he told CNN, pointing to disease outbreaks or extreme weather events that could wipe out local production.\n“The Netherlands, Ireland, Germany and France… those are all major global food exporters,” he added. “It’s still going to be easier to ship to the UK than it is to any other global market.”\nPrice at the Birmingham Wholesale Market says the new border charges give local suppliers the chance to offer more competitive prices than their EU counterparts. “This is hopefully an opportunity for the UK farmers,” he added.\nThe UK already uses about 70% of its land for agriculture, well above major EU agricultural producers, according to World Bank data. Still, experts say the country has scope to grow more of its own fresh produce, including apples, pears, tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers.\nBut here too Brexit hasn’t helped, ending as it did the free movement of EU workers on whom British farmers had relied for decades.\nSeasonal worker visas were temporarily introduced to address this issue, allowing agricultural workers from the EU and elsewhere to work on UK farms for short periods. But with the program set to expire at the end of this year, many farmers are filled with trepidation over what comes next.\n“No agricultural business knows whether they will have seasonal workers for 2025. That is rapidly approaching a crisis,” Tom Bradshaw, president of the National Farmers’ Union (NFU), told CNN. “You’re not going to invest in production for the long term if you don’t know about access to your workforce.”\nBrexit has also spurred the UK government to agree free trade deals with Australia and New Zealand, handing countries with much larger and more cost-effective agricultural industries tariff-free access to British supermarket shelves.\n“Since the 2016 referendum our political system has been in complete turmoil. Farming has been sold down the line and used as a bargaining chip in trade talks,” Philip Maddocks, the CEO of PDM Produce, a salad grower in the English county of Shropshire, said at a recent NFU Conference.\nIn addition to Brexit-related challenges, UK farmers have been squeezed by soaring input costs, including those of fertilizer, energy and labor. Supermarkets, a handful of which wield enormous power in Britain’s food supply chain, have often been unwilling to pay local producers more, opting instead for imports to keep their prices low.\nIn December, the government launched a review to “increase fairness” in the supply chain for fresh produce, which will probe contractual arrangements between UK producers and retailers.\n“I’m not hugely in favor of subsidies, I’m in favor of fair food prices,” Maddocks said. “The government needs a strategy for food… that looks out at the next 20 years, not five or one, or even months, as has been the case in the past few years.”\n",

    "content": "Editor’s Note: This article was originally published by The Business of Fashion, an editorial partner of CNN Style.\n(CNN) — A little over a year ago, NFL player Travis Kelce stepped out in a flamboyant silk shirt emblazoned with two barrel-chest-sized pink flamingos and trimmed across the bottom with a giant Chanel logo.\nThe design was upcycled from vintage Chanel scarves by stylist Logan Horne, whose brand, J. Logan Home, specializes in refashioning heritage luxury accessories. His pieces, which retail at close to $3,000 each, have also been worn by the musicians Dua Lipa and 2 Chainz and are sold at stores including Farfetch, Kith and The Webster. They’ve also caught the attention of the French luxury giant’s legal department.\nIn February, lawyers acting for Chanel sent Horne a cease and desist letter, demanding his label stop selling products bearing its logo and other brand signifiers.\nRelated article\nCapturing the ambitious beauty of Karl Lagerfeld’s Chanel shows\nIt’s the latest in a flurry of cases that have turned upcycling into an emerging legal battle ground, pitting a practice that’s been pitched as key to improving the industry’s sustainability credentials against the established bounds of trademark protection.\n“We really have these two values that point in different directions,” said Fashion Law Institute founder Susan Scafidi. “(Upcycling) is absolutely risky, despite the fact that it is trending and ethical.”\nChanel’s objection to J. Logan Home’s designs isn’t exactly a bolt from the blue.\nMajor luxury players have historically been wary of the secondary market, concerned it could damage their carefully controlled hold on brand distribution and image, cannibalize sales and encourage counterfeiting.\nIt’s a tension that has played out prominently over the last decade thanks to the rapid rise of online resale platforms. Though some brands have begun to tentatively embrace the space, others have remained cautious. Chanel, in particular, has pursued high-profile cases against re-commerce players it argues are using its brand without permission and selling fakes.\n(The brand scored a major win earlier this year, when a New York court awarded it $4 million in damages in its suit against the resale business What Goes Around Comes Around. A separate legal dispute with The RealReal is ongoing.)\nSmaller-scale upcycling has attracted less attention so far. But the practice has become more widespread, driven in part by demand for logo-heavy streetwear, greater access to vintage products and deadstock fabrics and a growing desire among young designers to operate sustainably.\nThat’s given rise to an increasing number of trademark and copyright infringement complaints targeting upcyclers from brands including Louis Vuitton and Levi’s, as well as Chanel.\nIn 2022, Louis Vuitton secured a $603,000 pay out and permanent injunction in a Texas case against a business selling refashioned Vuitton products. Last year, Levi’s brought a complaint against French label Coperni, alleging it was using pocket stitching and fabric tabs confusingly similar to the famed denim label. The sale of such products, alongside items that had actually been upcycled from Levi’s jeans without authorization, created additional risk of consumer confusion, the company argued.\nBoth brands declined to comment when reached by Business of Fashion.\nThe disputes reflect legitimate trademark and copyright concerns, but they also raise questions over how far these protections should stretch when they conflict with broader sustainability goals, according to legal experts.\n“It is a grey area within the law,” said Scafidi. “Brands absolutely have a legal leg to stand on. The question is how well-clad it is.”\nIn general terms, once a brand has sold an item, it becomes fair game to be resold or redistributed by third parties. But this principle, known as the first-sale doctrine or trademark exhaustion, may not apply if an item has been reworked or embellished, lawyers said.\nUpcyclers can take precautions, like avoiding the prominent use of logos, or providing consumers with clear disclosures that reworked products are not authorized or affiliated with the brands they reference (an approach J. Logan Home adopted). But these steps still may not be sufficient to counter arguments of copyright or trademark infringement, according to lawyers.\nAnd while the legal frameworks protecting companies’ intellectual property are well established, whether the sustainability benefits of upcycling should be weighed against these hasn’t really been tested.\nRelated article\nSpot the ‘superfake’: Fashion brands want you to be able to identify counterfeits\n“If we want to move from a linear to a circular economy, we need to upcycle,” said Irene Calboli, a professor of law at Texas A&M University. “The fact that intellectual property law gets in the way of those who want to upcycle or recycle is just wrong.”\nChanel said it is paying close attention to sustainability matters, pointing to its work with L’Atelier des Matières, which recycles unsold items and deadstock from luxury and premium brands.\n“(Upcycling is) a positive trend that we continue to explore, and we have always been conscious of the need to strike a balance between protecting the rights of our brand and the rights of others to create and trade freely,” the company said in a statement. “However, the use of elements stamped with the Chanel logo is sometimes simply an unauthorized misappropriation of our trademarks… in such cases, we take the action we deem appropriate to protect our rights.”\nThe wider legal crackdown hasn’t only targeted brands making prominent use of logos either.\nBefore she became a celebrated New York designer, Batsheva Hay worked as a copyright lawyer. So it was a shock when she found herself on the receiving end of a cease and desist letter from a large commercial brand over a short run of dresses made from deadstock fabric sourced from India. Though it bore no obvious logo, as it turned out, the print she used had been made for a bigger player who didn’t want to see it reproduced elsewhere.\n“I was really humiliated and horrified because I thought it was some cool vintage fruit print and it turned out to be some kind of junky commercial print,” said Hay. Rather than take on the time and expense of fighting the case, she just took the remaining three dresses she hadn’t yet sold off her site.\nHorne says he can’t afford to fight Chanel, which has threatened to seek statutory damages of $2 million per mark, disgorgement of all profits and payment of its attorney’s fees if he doesn’t stop selling products carrying the company’s branding, according to a copy of the letter reviewed by Business of Fashion.\nInstead, he said he’s looking at to pivot his brand while continuing to find creative ways to address the industry’s issues with waste and over-production. The dream would be an opportunity to officially collaborate with an established label on an upcycled collection.\n“As much as I believe in my mission… I’m not trying to go bankrupt going to battle with Chanel,” he said.\nIndustry watchers say the current flurry of cases reflect a broader adjustment to emerging new models. Some big brands, like Prada, Gucci and indeed Levi’s, have already dabbled with upcycling collections and programs of their own. Anna Foster, who runs the refashioned brand E.L.V. Denim, has partnered with companies including Gabriela Hearst and The Outnet to help upcycle excess inventory. These days, she says she’s having about a conversation a week with brands interested in exploring collaboration, but the industry moves slowly.\nRelated article\nAsian rivers are turning black. And our colorful closets are to blame\nMeanwhile, politics may be moving at a faster speed, creating different challenges for brands. Both consumers and policy makers are increasingly aware of the huge levels of waste generated by the fashion industry, with new regulations that would make brands more responsible for dealing with old clothes and excess inventory in the pipeline in both Europe and the US.\n“We really are at an inflection point where we might have a result in court that is different from the result in the court of social media,” said Scafidi. “It’s that tension that really needs to be resolved.”\nThis article was originally published by The Business of Fashion, an editorial partner of CNN Style.

    "publishedAt": "12:00 PM EDT, Fri April 26, 2024",
    "content": "The head of the Federal Student Aid office, which has faced criticism for the botched rollout of this year’s college financial aid form, will be stepping down.\nAccording to a letter to staff obtained by CNN, Richard Cordray said Friday that he will not be continuing in his role for another three-year term. He has served as the chief operating officer of FSA in the Department of Education since May 4, 2021, and will stay on through June to help with the transition.\nThe announcement of Cordray’s departure comes as his office has been under fire for problems with a new version of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, released late last year. Delays and technical glitches have kept millions of students waiting to hear how much college will cost them this fall and have raised concerns that some low-income students won’t enroll at all.\nEarlier this month, Cordray became a focus of a hearing held by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce about the FAFSA rollout.\n“If there was a financial aid director, or even a college president, that delayed financial aid on their campus for up to six months, the professional price that would be paid for that would be pretty steep,” Justin Draeger, president of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, told lawmakers.\nThe committee, led by Republican Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, later posted to X that “It’s time for Richard Cordray to go.”\nIn a statement Friday, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona applauded Cordray’s work to make improvements to the student loan program, administering a record amount of student debt forgiveness and holding schools that defrauded students accountable —but did not mention the FAFSA overhaul.\n“We are grateful for Rich Cordray’s three years of service, in which he accomplished more transformational changes to the student aid system than any of his predecessors,” Cardona said.\n“It’s no exaggeration to say that Rich helped change millions of lives for the better,” he added.\nPreviously, Cordray was the first director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which launched during the Obama administration. Before that, he served as Ohio’s attorney general and was the Democratic nominee for governor of Ohio in 2018.\n“Over my tenure, we provided student loan forgiveness to more than 4,000,000 borrowers and their families; made it easier for people to apply for and manage federal student aid; and took strong actions to hold schools accountable for defrauding students,” Cordray said in a statement sent to CNN.\nThe congressionally mandated overhaul of the FAFSA was authorized through two different pieces of legislation passed in 2019 and 2020. The changes were long overdue and are meant to simplify the form and to make more low-income students eligible for federal student aid such as Pell grants.\nWhile the new version of the form is much shorter, the rollout has been plagued by problems that have created major delays for students planning to go to college this fall.\nFirst, the form wasn’t available until the very end of December — about three months later than usual — and was offline for many hours of the day during the first week of January.\nRelated article\nWhy students are freaking out about the FAFSA this year\nSince then, many families and students have experienced problems and glitches when submitting the form. FAFSA completions among high school seniors are currently down 36% compared with the prior class, according to the National College Attainment Network.\nFurther problems on the back end and a last-minute change to the aid calculation meant that colleges did not receive any FAFSA information until March, even if a student submitted the form back in January. Once colleges received the data from the Department of Education, there were errors with some of the information, and many forms must be reprocessed.\nAs a result, many financial aid applicants are still waiting to hear how much college will cost them next year, even as the typical May 1 college decision deadline approaches.\nThe Biden administration has said that the overhaul of the FAFSA was a huge undertaking — one that not only transformed the form itself, but also the calculations and back-end processing system — and that its requests for more funding from Congress were not met.\nBut Republicans have argued that the Department of Education was too focused on implementing Biden’s student loan forgiveness policies and let the FAFSA work fall to the wayside.\nThe Department of Education has been facing criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle for the delays, and the Government Accountability Office has started an investigation into the new form’s implementation.\nAs the head of FSA, Cordray oversaw not only the FAFSA but also the entire $1.6 trillion federal student loan system.\nDuring Cordray’s tenure, the Department of Education authorized the cancellation of about $153 billion in federal student loan debt for 4 million borrowers. FSA tackled a backlog of debt relief applications, which built up during the Trump administration, from borrowers who said they were defrauded by their for-profit colleges. The office also expanded the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and streamlined debt cancellation for permanently disabled borrowers.\nLast year, the FSA launched a new income-driven repayment plan, known as SAVE (Saving on a Valuable Education), which offers  generous terms for low-income student loan borrowers.\nCordray also oversaw the unprecedented return to repayment after the three-plus-year pandemic pause ended last year.\nWhen the Biden administration tapped Cordray to run FSA, it was viewed as a win for progressives.\nDuring Cordray’s tenure at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — an agency spearheaded by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren — he made it a priority to protect student loan borrowers. The agency secured more than $480 million in debt forgiveness for borrowers who had taken out loans to go to Corinthian Colleges, a now-defunct, for-profit school. It also sued Navient, one of the biggest federal student loan servicers, for allegedly processing payments incorrectly. Navient has denied the allegations, and the lawsuit is ongoing.\n“I’m grateful to Rich for his commitment to building a country that doesn’t just work for the wealthy and well connected, but for all Americans,” Warren said in a statement sent to CNN on Friday.\n",

Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nNewsweek has reached out to the Pentagon via email for additional information.\nUkraine debuted its ATACMS in October 2023 using a cluster variant of the missiles to strike two Russian military bases in Ukraine and damage a slew of helicopters.\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan said last month that President Joe Biden had secretly authorized a \"significant number of ATACMS missiles\" to Ukraine in February.\nReuters reported on Saturday that a U.S. official said Washington had quietly sent longer-range versions of ATACMS to Ukraine, which were used to strike Russian-controlled Crimea in mid-April. It was reported in mid-February that the U.S. favored sending longer-range ATACMS to Kyiv to enable strikes on the Russian-held Crimean peninsula. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine back in 2014.\nThey were part of a $300 million aid package announced in mid-March and they have already arrived in Ukraine for use within the country's borders, Sullivan said. \"We've already sent some, we will send more now that we have additional authority and money,\" he added.\nThe U.S. did not publicly announce the delivery of ATACMS because of a Ukrainian request for \"operational security,\" U.S. State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel said during a press briefing last month.\n\"Until recently, as we've said on many occasions, we were unable to provide these ATACMS because of readiness concerns,\" Sullivan told the media on April 24.\nThe Biden administration had been working \"behind the scenes\" to alleviate these concerns, Sullivan told reporters, adding: \"We now have a significant number of ATACMS coming off the production line and entering U.S. stocks.\"\nATACMS give Kyiv's troops the firepower to strike high-value Russian assets far behind the frontlines. They beef up Ukraine's long-range capabilities, alongside other long-range weapons like the British Storm Shadow and French SCALP air-launched cruise missiles.\n",

    "content": "McDonald’s and other fast food chains are charging more. So much so that you may want to consider going for a slightly slower burger. Or at least, that’s what Applebee’s wants you to think about.\n“You can get our burger for $9.99,” John Peyton, CEO of Applebee’s parent company Dine Brands, told CNN in an interview. With that in mind, “why would you take a $10 burger … that you can eat in a bag out of your car?”\nIf Peyton’s sales pitch resonates with customers, it could help convince diners to eat at sit-down restaurants, something they might otherwise see as an indulgence.\nFor a while, restaurant customers were trading down — swapping out expensive meals for cheaper ones, but still dining out. Now, some are responding to higher menu prices by trading out entirely: Instead of opting for cheaper restaurants or meals, they’re eating more at home and spending less when they do go out.\nThat means that restaurants have to battle it out for these cost-conscious consumers. And now, it’s not just burger chain against burger chain.\nRelated article\nRestaurants are competing for frugal diners’ dollars\nBecause fast food joints have been hiking up prices in recent years, dine-in spots like Applebee’s can run promotions that end up costing about the same as a fast food lunch — giving them a chance to try to steal those customers away.\nThe overlap offers “a new opportunity,” according to Peyton. Lunch at McDonald’s now costs about the same as lunch at Applebee’s, where you can sit at a table and have your meal delivered by a server. Pointing that out is a new way to bid for customers.\nApplebee’s, which has seen sales slump as lower-income customers pull back, is offering deals and hoping the prices will speak for themselves. Chili’s, on the other hand, is making the comparison more explicit.\nFor them, and the fast food chains they’re now competing against, the stakes are high.\nYears of price hikes have contributed to declining traffic, pushing restaurants to fight over fewer customers, according to David Henkes, a senior principal at Technomic, a food industry research and consulting firm.\n“It’s a smaller pie today than it was a year ago,” he said. “You’re competing for a share of a smaller market. And so it is more competitive.”\nFast food prices, in particular, have shot up. “Fast food has gotten really expensive,” Henkes said. “Certainly, relative to where it was 12 to 18 months ago, and also in comparison to casual dining sit-down restaurants right now.”\nIn the 12 months through March, not adjusting for seasonal swings, prices at fast food and fast casual restaurants went up 5%, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In that period full-service menu prices went up 3.2%, and grocery prices ticked up 1.2%.\nA few years ago, McDonald’s said that it could raise prices without losing too many customers. But now, it’s struggling with lower-income customers.\nRelated article\nWhat went wrong at Red Lobster\nCEO Chris Kempczinski said during a February analyst call that “the battle ground is certainly with that low-income consumer.” The following month, CFO Ian Borden conceded during another analyst call that “it’s a challenging consumer environment.”\nThe chain is working on a $5 menu to win over those customers, according to Bloomberg.\nThings aren’t much better over at Applebee’s.\nSales at US Applebee’s locations open at least a year slumped 4.6% in the first quarter. In that period, customers who earn $50,000 a year or less visited less often, and spent less when they did, Peyton said, adding that the demographic makes up about 45% of Applebee’s customers.\n“For several quarters… we’ve been asking ourselves, when will we see the impact of inflation, and the economy in general, and interest rates, on on our guest,” he said. “We really began to see it in the first quarter.”\nHe added that “we think it’s going to be a fight for share of wallet and market share all year.”\nWith fast food prices high, sit-down restaurants can make a case for themselves.\nPeople have taken their fast food price grievances to social channels, some complaining about the price of McDonald’s burgers and hash browns. Chili’s has been paying attention.\n“Our social media team has been watching the conversation that the consumer is frustrated by fast food prices,” said Kevin Hochman, president of Chili’s and CEO of its parent company, Brinker International, during an April analyst call. In response, Chili’s decided to run ads that “use fast food as a foil,” he said.\nThe chain said in an April press release that it was adding a new burger — which it described as having “twice the beef of a Big Mac and flavors fast food lovers will recognize” — to its ‘3 for me’ value menu. For $10.99, customers get the burger plus an app and a drink.\nOn X, Chili’s asked whether Chili’s is better than fast food, and promised rewards to those who said yes. Chili’s also ran video ads comparing its food favorably to fast food burgers.\nBut it might not be that easy. Getting people to go to Chili’s instead of McDonald’s may be a stretch, said Henkes.\nOne problem for chains like Chili’s and Applebee’s is that they’re not so much competing on price, as they are on time.\n“People go to sit-down restaurants, generally speaking, for different occasions, than they go to fast food restaurants,” Henkes noted. You might expect to spend an hour at a Chili’s or an Applebee’s, and breeze right through a McDonald’s.\nStill, campaigns like Chili’s can help communicate to customers that these days its food is relatively cheap.\n“Planting that seed that, ‘Hey, we’re a good value,’ I think is a good message to have,” Henkes said.\n",

    "content": "Architect Tosin Oshinowo is no stranger to versatility. She has designed one of the largest malls in Lagos, Nigeria, beach houses on the city’s coast and homes for internally displaced people in the north of the country. She also runs a bespoke furniture design company, and the Nigerian is the first African woman to curate the Sharjah Architecture Triennial, happening in the United Arab Emirates from November 2023 to March 2024.\nIn late 2022, she and her design practice, cmDesign Atelier (cmDA), also completed their first residential project in the ultra-exclusive Banana Island neighborhood in Lagos: “The Lantern House.”\nOshinowo says the Lantern House project, a five-bedroom, seven-bathroom, three-story sustainable home, powered entirely by solar energy, was both exciting and a “slow labor of love.”\nContacted by her clients in September 2020, she, alongside her team and specialist contractors for various aspects of the home, started construction in January 2021 and ended last October.\nThe 1.6 million-square meter (17 million-square feet), man-made Banana Island is named for its shape, and is a private, gated community in Nigeria’s commercial capital. (The exclusive area also made news in April, when a seven-story building under construction collapsed – adding to the list of building collapses in the greater Lagos State.)\nWith private power and water infrastructure systems, property on the island is some of the most expensive on the continent. That exclusivity was one of the main challenges for the Lantern House project, says Oshinowo, with strictly enforced restricted working hours that made looming deadlines difficult to meet.\nDespite this, Oshinowo says seeing her vision come to life was fulfilling, adding that she’s proud of the end result. “It’s one thing to produce great conceptual design. It’s another thing to execute it to a seamless finish,” she said. “It’s such an exciting feeling to think that the decisions that you’ve made have worked.”\nShe says something the Lantern House project emphasized for her is that “being meticulous in the long run always pays off.” cmDA has since started working on another project on Banana Island.\nThe story behind this surreal portrait of Ethiopian identity\nOshinowo remembers wanting to be an architect from the age of 12, looking over floor plans and helping her father to design part of their holiday home when she was young. With degrees in architecture and urban design from the UK as well as an MBA in architecture, she worked for architecture firms in the UK and Europe before moving back to Nigeria in 2009.\nThe award-winning architect says she founded cmDA in 2012 out of a need to create a strong aesthetic language; one that also projected a contemporary and progressive cultural identity of Africa. “(It’s) very important to create architecture that, as much as possible, can be delivered from what is available in country,” Oshinowo added. “And also in doing that, starting to think about issues to do with sustainability and responsibility towards the environment.”\nPritzker Prize 2022: Francis Kéré becomes first African to win ‘Nobel of architecture’\nThis bent towards sustainability is something the 43-year-old has carried into her curatorial role for this year’s upcoming Sharjah Architecture Triennial. The theme Oshinowo came up with is “The beauty of impermanence and the architecture of adaptability” which, she says, looks at under-celebrated innovations in the global south that deal with conditions of scarcity. She adds that she hopes the triennial will be an engaging space for the international community.\n“It’s a validation to know that coming from Nigeria, practicing as a Black female architect in West Africa, that my work is not just relevant to the context of where we find ourselves now,” Oshinowo said, “in terms of importance relating to sustainability (and) adaptability, but also to equity.”\n",

    "content": "Donald Trump will make his most concentrated effort yet to turn his criminal trial into a political asset in the next two days, heading from the courtroom to the campaign trail and back again.\nThe former president’s hush money trial resumes in New York on Tuesday as prosecutors seek to prove that Trump falsified business records to cover up an alleged affair and thereby interfered in the 2016 election by misleading voters. They’ve been unwilling to reveal witnesses in advance in order to shield them from Trump’s attacks. But they are expected to press on with questioning a former banker for Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer and fixer who made hush money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, who alleged the affair that Trump denies. Trump has pleaded not guilty in the case.\nWith court dark on Wednesday, the presumptive GOP nominee will fly to the epicenter of his clash with President Joe Biden, making stops in two swing states, Wisconsin and Michigan, that could decide the destiny of the White House. The trip will show how useful it is for an indicted candidate to have his own plane. But more significantly, this will be Trump’s most intense campaign travel in weeks, and he is sure to dig in on his false claims that his four indictments were directly instigated by the White House.\nTrump’s return to full-time campaigning will be fleeting, however. He must be back in court Thursday — when Judge Juan Merchan will hold another hearing over prosecution claims he’s regularly violating a partial gag order meant to protect witnesses, court staff and even the judge’s own family.\nThe juxtaposition between campaigning — where Trump will revert to his domineering political persona — and his mute disempowerment in the courtroom, where the judge is in charge, will be another remarkable moment in a presidential election campaign like no other. It will emphasize how the 2024 White House race is so far being shaped as much by what happens in court as in traditional campaigning. And it will underscore how Trump has made his defense in multiple criminal cases the same as his central campaign theme — that he’s effectively a political dissident who is the victim of unwarranted persecution.\nThe presumptive GOP nominee tells his supporters that he’s being targeted  because he’s preventing the same thing from happening to them. “I am your justice and for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution,” he told the Conservative Political Action Conference last year.\nThe opening week of the prosecution case contained detailed testimony that appeared to be damaging to Trump as former tabloid publisher David Pecker detailed “catch and kill” schemes that the ex-president allegedly used to suppress negative stories and attorneys teased out evidence about alleged financial irregularities.\n“It was election fraud. Pure and simple,” prosecutor Matthew Colangelo said in his opening statement. Trump’s counsel Todd Blanche countered: “I have a spoiler alert. There is nothing wrong with trying to influence an election. It’s called democracy.”\nThe ex-president is playing to a jury made up to tens of millions of voters. It is too early to tell how the electorate might respond to a conviction in the case or whether Trump could get a political boost if he is acquitted. The lesson of the Trump era, however, is that the ex-president’s supporters often see attempts to call him to legal account as an example of unfair victimization.\nRelated article\nCNN Poll: Few think Trump is being treated the same as other defendants\nCNN polling released last week suggests that there is no dominant public view on the trial, but that does not preclude the possibility that a guilty verdict could damage the former president. Only 44% of Americans expressed confidence that the jury will reach a fair verdict. Not surprisingly, a majority of Democrats feel that Trump is being treated more leniently than others, while a majority of Republicans think the opposite. One area of potential concern for Trump, however, is that 24% of his backers say a conviction might cause them to reconsider their support — although the overwhelming majority say they would not vote for Biden.\nTrump’s appearances in Wisconsin and Michigan will give him a more traditional platform than the dingy courtroom corridor where he’s been delivering daily screeds against the case and spinning a dystopian vision of a nation on the verge of collapse. But there’s also a risk Trump’s loose tongue out on the trail could get him into trouble following his alleged violations of Merchan’s gag order.\nThe former president has been complaining that he’s been penned up in court and unable to effectively campaign. “I’m not in Georgia, or Florida or North Carolina, campaigning like I should be. This is about election interference,” he said earlier this month. But he spent the trial’s off day last Wednesday playing golf at his course in Bedminster, New Jersey, CNN reported. Still, the four-day-a-week court schedule does present its constraints. Trump, for example, has yet to reschedule a rally that had been due to take place on April 20 in North Carolina but was cancelled because of a dangerous storm.\nIn the meantime, Trump’s allies are pushing the persecution theme. “I think all these trials are political. I think it’s selective prosecution. I think what’s going on in New York is an outrage,” Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. This view ignores the fact that all of the indictments emerged from grand juries and according to established legal procedure and that some of Trump’s alleged crimes strike at the heart of America’s bedrock political system. But such rhetoric is convincing to Trump supporters and is repeated in a daily drumbeat on conservative media in order to disguise the nature of the charges.\nTrump’s itinerary on Wednesday reflects the critical importance of two states that he won in 2016 but lost to Biden on his way out of the White House in 2020. Battleground polls published by CBS News on Sunday showed the rivals neck-and-neck in Wisconsin and Michigan. They were also tied in Pennsylvania, a third swing state Biden flipped from Trump four years ago. The president’s hopes of a second term probably rest on him winning at least two of the three states to get to 270 electoral votes. Biden has made multiple campaign stops while the ex-president has been stuck in New York.\nRelated article\nCNN Poll: Trump maintains lead over Biden in 2024 matchup as views on their presidencies diverge\nThe Trump campaign is billing the presumptive GOP nominee’s trip to Waukesha, Wisconsin, as a chance to highlight the “the peace, prosperity, and security of his first term with Joe Biden’s failed presidency.” That might seem like a hard case to make for a twice-impeached former president who attempted to crush US democracy to stay in office.\nYet, a new CNN poll released Sunday suggests that Trump’s message might be resonating with some voters at a time of high grocery prices, elevated interest rates and turmoil abroad. Some 55% of Americans now see the ex-president’s term as successful, while 61% think that Biden’s presidency is a failure, according to the poll. Biden’s ratings are especially poor on the economy, immigration and on his handling of Israel’s war in Gaza against Hamas, an issue that is especially important to voters under 35, a key sector of the Democratic coalition.\nThe former president and his allies are already seizing on the countrywide pro-Palestinian protests at college campuses to embroider their claims of a nation under siege from left-wing extremists on Biden’s watch. While the protests typically only include a minority of students at each campus and have not reached anywhere near the momentum of Vietnam War or civil rights-era demonstrations, television footage of police confronting students holding sit-ins contains emotive imagery that can be used selectively in the kind of demagogic campaign that Trump is running. Any sense of political unrest among voters could draw some of them toward his warnings that America needs tough, strongman leadership. The former president last week said that the current campus protests made the 2017 rally by White extremists in Charlottesville, Virginia – in which a woman died – look like a “peanut.” But the campus protests have been mostly peaceful — unlike the mob of Trump supporters that came to Washington and smashed its way into the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.\nThe campus demonstrations have split the Democratic Party down the middle – a divide House Speaker Mike Johnson sought to widen last week by traveling to Columbia University and calling for the National Guard to be deployed to break up demonstrations.\nHis decision to seize the issue underscored the way campaigns construct narratives that may not be completely true but that can be politically potent if they play into perceptions voters are already forming. Trump is following a similar playbook as he fuses his criminal defense as a supposed victim of partisan persecution with his political offensive for a White House comeback.\n",

    "content": "President Joe Biden is considering executive action to close the southern U.S. border, according to recent reports. Here is what we know.\nMultiple media outlets have said the president is looking at using Section 212 (f) of the U.S. Code, which allows him to \"suspend the entry\" of certain groups when the number of crossings reaches a certain size.\nThere has been no official announcement from the White House but Biden and several governors have been fairly open about the fact the Government is looking into what it can do.\nAt the end of February, after Biden's bipartisan bill collapsed when Republicans backed away from the agreement, the President reportedly told the National Governors Association he was exploring executive actions. The Bill would have, in theory, restricted illegal border crossings, made it more difficult to apply for asylum and speed up deportations while simultaneously making more visas available legally.\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox, the Republican chair of the association said: \"[Biden] did say that he has been working with his attorneys, trying to understand what executive action would be upheld in the courts and would be constitutional, and that he seemed a little frustrated that he was not getting answers from attorneys that he felt he could take the kind of actions that he wanted to.\"\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis, the Democratic vice-chair of the governors' group, said governors got a \"general sense that they're looking into whatever they can do on the executive side.\"\nThe administration has since gone fairly quiet on its plan. \"They're in that pretty classic mode of, nothing is on fire right now,\" an immigration advocate who was working with the government told Politico earlier this week.\nA White House official reportedly responded to Politico, saying the administration could still go ahead with the move in the coming weeks.\nNewsweek has contacted the administration via its press office for comment.\nWhite House correspondent for PBS NewsHour, Laura Barrón-López, reported that sources have told her the close-border action could come after the Mexican election on June 2.\nShe said: \"It's going to be expected to be similar language that was used in the bipartisan Senate border deal that failed.\n\"For example, if there is an average of 5,000 migrants encountered each day over the course of seven days, then this authority would be triggered, and President Biden would be able to shutdown the border until those encounters fall.\n\"Now, the White House and a White House official told me that no final decisions have been made about an executive action that is potentially being considered.\"\nShe went on to mention activists' concerns that measures like this, which usually do not apply to unaccompanied children for humanitarian reasons, could \"put people in a position where they make the impossible choice of trying to send their children across the border alone.\"\nThere are also worries that people will resort to more dangerous routes if their points of entry are restricted.\nBut Biden would be responding to something Americans are very concerned about, with immigration ranking as the top issue facing the U.S. for most folks, even more so than the economy, according to a Gallup poll from April.\n",

The move comes as state and federal officials grapple with a spike in border encounters in recent years. The rise in opioid use and overdoses in the U.S. has also been linked to drug smuggling across the southern border.\n\"Our top priority is the safety of our communities statewide,\" Newsom said in the release. \"By working with state, local, and federal partners to take down transnational organizations and the illegal drugs they attempt to bring into our state, the state's Counter Drug Taskforce is making a profound difference to hold smugglers accountable and take deadly drugs off our streets.\"\nFrom January through April, California's National Guard, also known as CalGuard, said that it seized over 5.8 million fentanyl pills, including more than 2.3 million in April alone. According to CalGuard Major General Matthew Beevers, the state Counter Drug Taskforce deployed 30 service members in 2022 to points of entry in Southern California at San Ysidro, Otay Mesa, Tecate and Calexico.\n\"Due to significant initial success, in 2023, we doubled our force across those Ports of Entry,\" Beevers added, as quoted in the release. \"Under Governor Newsom's leadership and broad Congressional support, our Counter Drug Taskforce has grown from 155 full-time service members to 392 today.\"\nNewsweek reached out to Newsom's office via email on Thursday for additional information.\nDrug-related overdoses have spiked across the U.S. in recent years. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, accounted for the most drug overdose deaths in 2022. As Newsom's office noted in its release on Thursday, the majority of fentanyl that is smuggled into the country is carried out by U.S. citizens. In 2022, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, 88 percent of offenders trafficking fentanyl were American citizens.\nThe CDC reported that the state with the highest rate of drug-related deaths in 2022 was West Virginia, with 80.9 deaths per 100,000 residents. Other locations topping the CDC's list for that year, all per 100,000 residents, were: the District of Columbia (64.3 deaths), Tennessee (56 deaths) and Delaware (55.3 deaths).\nCalifornia had among the lower drug-related death rates in 2022, at 26.9 deaths per 100,000 residents. In total, 10,952 Californians died from a drug overdose that year.\n",

Biden himself voiced that warning in his most explicit terms yet last week, telling CNN’s Erin Burnett that the US would withhold some additional arms shipments to Israel if they were to take such a step.\n“The president was clear that he would not supply certain offensive weapons for such an operation were to occur,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters at the White House Monday. “It has not yet occurred.”\nAs the war enters its eighth month, US officials are increasingly questioning Israel’s approach to the war, including publicly suggesting it is unlikely to achieve its stated aim of destroying Hamas and eliminating its leadership.\nOn Monday, Kurt Campbell, the State Department’s number two official, said there have plainly been tensions between the two countries on “what the theory of victory is.”\n“Sometimes when we listen closely to Israeli leaders, they talk about mostly the idea of some sort of sweeping victory on the battlefield, total victory. I don’t think we believe that that is likely or possible,” Campbell said, in a seeming allusion to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s repeated references to a “total victory.” “We view that there has to be more of a political solution. That’s one of the reasons why the president’s team has been so engaged with the surrounding region,” Campbell said at the NATO Youth Summit co-hosted by the Aspen Institute.\nGoing “headlong into Rafah” could have dire consequences, Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned on Sunday.\n“Israel’s on the trajectory, potentially, to inherit an insurgency with many armed Hamas left, or, if it leaves, a vacuum filled by chaos, filled by anarchy and probably refilled by Hamas,” Blinken said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\nAnd though the US believes Israel will be unable to completely destroy Hamas, the administration believes Israel has achieved many of its initial war aims. State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said last week that Hamas has been “significantly degraded.”\n“You have seen their ability to launch the kind of attacks that they did on October 7 significantly degraded, if not completely eliminated,” he said. “They couldn’t launch an attack of that scale today.”\n“Their weapons production factories underground have been eliminated. Most of their battalion leadership in the north and in central Gaza has been eliminated. So Israel has achieved a great number of its military objectives,” he continued.\nIt remains unclear whether senior Hamas leaders are present in Rafah, but the US is continuing to assist Israel in its mission of trying to eradicate as many senior members as possible, including by providing significant intelligence assistance in trying to track down figures including Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’s leader in Gaza.\nAs Biden continues to call for Israel and Hamas to reach a temporary ceasefire and hostage release agreement, in private, senior US officials have not gone as far as to urge Israel to consider a permanent end to the fighting, according to the senior administration official. However, the Biden administration has been ramping up the pressure on Israel to start focusing much more in earnest on post-war Gaza plans – so far, to little effect.\nIsrael’s lack of interest on the so-called “day after” plans has been a source of growing frustration for Biden advisers, according to one of the senior administration officials, who went as far as to describe Israel as displaying the attitude of believing that post-war Gaza is somebody else’s problem to figure out.\nIn public and in private, this official said, Israel has offered no clear views on two major questions: post-war governance and who would oversee the strip’s security whenever the war eventually comes to an end.\nBlinken publicly called on Israel to engage more seriously on developing a plan for post-war Gaza over the weekend. So far, the engagement has been sorely lacking, Blinken said.\n“We’ve been working for many, many weeks on developing critical plans for security, for governance, for rebuilding. We haven’t seen that come from Israel,” Blinken said on CBS. “We’ve been working with Arab countries and others on that plan. We need to see that too. We have the same objective as Israel. We want to make sure that Hamas cannot govern Gaza again.”\n",

    "content": "Hong Kong — HSBC has announced its chief executive Noel Quinn will retire — a surprise departure by its hard-nosed leader of five years who has overseen a sweeping series of asset sales across the globe.\nThe Asia-focused bank said in a statement Tuesday that it had launched a formal process to find a successor.\nChief financial officer Georges Elhedery, appointed to the No. 2 role in January 2023, is likely the leading internal candidate for the job.\nQuinn, 62, has restored momentum to the bank’s profits and share price by getting rid of or slashing in size underperforming businesses, including the lender’s retail banking businesses in the United States and France, its entire Canadian subsidiary and units in smaller markets such as Argentina.\nHSBC’s (HSBC) shares, which have gained roughly 30% during his tenure, rose about 1.3% and touched a nine-month high in the afternoon session in Hong Kong.\n“I think shrinking businesses in Western markets such as the US, Canada and Europe has been a good move for HSBC at the same time as boosting the group’s Asian business,” said Simon Yuen, founder of Hong Kong-based Surich Asset Management, which is an HSBC shareholder.\n“We do hope that the next CEO would lay out more plans, execution-wise, to further increase the bank’s businesses in Asian countries,” he added.\nQuinn will remain CEO until his successor starts in the role.\n“I’ve held intensive leadership roles since I took on a commercial bank role in October 2008, so I’m personally ready for a change,” Quinn told reporters on a call.\n“It’s also a natural inflection point for the bank, as it comes to the end of the current transformation phase. It’s an ideal time to bring in leadership to move the bank forward over the next five years.”\nHSBC Chairman Mark Tucker said the bank was aiming to complete Quinn’s succession process by second half of this year.\n“He (Quinn) first informed me of this earlier this month,” Tucker said of the timing of Quinn’s decision to step down, adding that the decision was Quinn’s own and that the board supported it.\nQuinn, who joined HSBC in 1987, was named the chief executive of the bank, which makes most of its revenues and profits in Asia, in March 2020, after serving as an interim CEO following the surprise ouster of his predecessor.\nHe played a crucial role in navigating challenges during and after the coronavirus pandemic, as well as heightened geopolitical tensions that weighed on the bank’s key market, China.\nHe also won a major showdown with the bank’s No. 1 Asian investor, China’s Ping An Insurance, which ran a multi-year campaign to try and get HSBC to spin off its Asia business, which ended in defeat at the bank’s shareholder meeting last year.\nHSBC also faced criticism in recent years from Western lawmakers over its dealings with China amid growing geopolitical tensions. Hong Kong is HSBC’s single largest market globally.\nHSBC reported pretax profit of $12.7 billion, slightly ahead of forecasts, for the quarter ended March versus $12.9 billion a year earlier, as it struggles to cope with rising costs from expansion in Asia.\nThe London-headquartered bank also announced $3 billion worth of share buybacks on top of $2 billion in share purchases announced in February.\n",

    "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\nWhat did people in the Stone Age eat before the advent of farming around 10,000 years ago? A long-held stereotype — one that’s influenced modern fad diets — is that ancient humans hunted large animals and chowed down on mammoth steak.\nBut new research on a Paleolithic group called the Iberomaurusians, hunter-gatherers who buried their dead in Taforalt cave in what’s now Morocco between 13,000 and 15,000 years ago, is adding to a growing body of evidence that challenges the notion human ancestors predominantly relied on meat, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution.\nScientists analyzed chemical signatures preserved in bones and teeth belonging to at least seven different Iberomaurusians and found that plants, not meat, were their primary source of dietary protein.\n“Our analysis showed that these hunter-gatherer groups, they included an important amount of plant matter, wild plants to their diet, which changed our understanding of the diet of pre-agricultural populations,” said lead study author Zineb Moubtahij, a doctoral student at Géosciences Environnement Toulouse, a research institute in France, and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.\nThe share of plant resources as a source of dietary protein in the humans whose remains were studied was similar to that seen in early farmers from the Levant, the present-day Eastern Mediterranean countries where plant domestication and farming were first documented.\nResearchers also spotted a higher number of tooth cavities among the Taforalt specimens than is typically seen with hunter-gatherer remains of that period. The evidence suggested that the Iberomaurusians consumed “fermentable starchy plants” such as wild cereals or acorns, according to the study. The findings raise some intriguing questions about how agriculture spread across different regions and populations.\n“While not all individuals primarily obtained their proteins from plants at Taforalt, it is unusual to document such a high proportion of plants in the diet of a pre-agricultural population,” said coauthor Klervia Jaouen, a researcher at Géosciences Environnement Toulouse, in an email.\n“This is likely the first time such a significant plant-based component in a Paleolithic diet has been documented using isotope techniques,” Jaouen added.\nThe researchers used a technique called stable isotope analysis to learn about the diet of each of the Iberomaurusians studied.\nNitrogen and zinc isotopes (variants of an element) contained in collagen and teeth enamel can reveal the amount of meat ancient diets once contained, while carbon isotopes can shed light on whether the main source of protein was meat or fish.\nRelated article\nA nutrient-rich food that once largely disappeared from Western diets was a staple of early Europeans, study finds\n“Humans consume these foods and the isotope information is recorded in tissues like bones and teeth,” Moubtahij said. “By analyzing this tissues that we find in archaeological records, we can know if a person ate more meat or they ate more plant-based food.”\nThe isotope technique shows the amount of plants eaten but not the type. However, botanical remains of charred sweet acorns, pistachio, pine nuts, wild oats and pulses discovered at the site support the information gleaned from the human remains. Grinding stones unearthed at the site also suggest plant processing took place nearby.\nHowever, the Iberomaurusians weren’t strict vegetarians, the study noted. Cut marks on the remains of Barbary sheep and gazelles, as well as ancient horselike and cowlike mammals, suggested that some animals had been butchered and processed for food.\nThe increased reliance on plant food was probably driven by several factors — including a wider range of edible plants and perhaps a depletion of large game species, according to the study.\nThe isotope analysis also detected evidence of one case of early weaning, with starchy plant foods introduced into an infant’s diet before its death at between 6 and 12 months old.\n“This contrasts with hunter-gatherer societies where extended breast-feeding periods are the norm due to the limited availability of weaning foods,” according to the study.\nThe research only investigated the diets among one group of Stone Age hunter-gatherers. However, a similar study published in January — which analyzed the remains of 24 early humans from two burial sites in Peru dating from 9,000 to 6,500 years ago — revealed that ancient diets in the Andes were composed of 80% percent plant matter and 20% meat.\nA November 2022 study revealed that Neanderthals and early Homo sapiens were sophisticated cooks, combining plant-based ingredients such as wild nuts, peas, vetch, lentils and wild mustard.\n“I don’t think that there is a standard diet for everyone (in this period), but it depends on the environment. Humans are resilient and flexible in their diet habits,” Moubtahij said.\nRelated article\nAncient teeth rarely have a cavity-causing bacteria commonly seen today. A new study reveals why\nThe work undermines the idea that a Stone Age diet was meat heavy — a rigid assumption perpetuated by present-day dietary trends like the Paleo diet. But the stereotype likely has its roots in past research, and there are a few possible reasons why.\nEvidence for meat-eating, in the form of butchered animal bones, is often more “archaeologically visible” than the evidence for plant eating, said Briana Pobiner, a research scientist and museum educator at the Human Origins Program in the department of anthropology at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. She wasn’t involved in the study.\nAnother reason for the idea that meat was central to early human diets is “the perception that hunting was a key behavioral innovation that occurred early in our evolutionary history — rooted in part in early hunter-gatherer studies carried out by male scholars that primarily focused on big game hunting by men and did not document, discounted, or downplayed the important dietary role of women gathering smaller game and plant resources,” she said via email.\nJaouen said that in the Levant region, archaeologists had documented a similar plant-based diet among another group that practiced a hunting-and-gathering lifestyle just before the development of agriculture, raising questions as to why the transition to farming did not simultaneously occur among the Iberomaurusian population.\nRelated article\nBones found in 8-meter-deep pit may ‘fundamentally change’ history of humans in Europe\n“These findings indicate that several populations at the end of the Paleolithic adopted a diet similar in terms of plant content to that of farmers,” she said.\nThe transition to agriculture was a complex process that occurred at different times and proceeded at different rates, in different ways with different foods, in different places, Pobiner said.\n“In other words, it was largely a local phenomenon that could involve transitional forms of subsistence — not a single, sharp, simultaneous worldwide shift,” she added.\n",

    "content": "I was 44 years old and pregnant. Unbelievable. Five pregnancy tests, all torn apart in some hotel in Kansas City. All positive within seconds. I was flabbergasted.\nMy partner and I hadn't used birth control in years. Not because we were trying for a child, but because after years of being casual about birth control, we assumed he shot blanks. I guess the joke was on me.\nThat night, I met an old colleague, and we caught up. I was dying inside but couldn't—wouldn't—share. Not that he wouldn't have accepted me. I was just afraid. Prideful. In shock. In denial.\nI called my partner and told him. He asked how that happened. I said, \"Lack of birth control, bud.\" By this time, our union was just a shell game. Smoke and mirrors. A happy looking, successful, and beautiful couple turned into a sham.\nI recall praying. I recall crying. I recall the decision to call the clinic and make an appointment to terminate the pregnancy. I called my mom and gained her support. I distinctly remember it was my choice.\nI did not consult my partner on the topic at all. Some regrets live on, and some don't. This was one that didn't. I simply was not going to get myself into any situation that would force me to be dependent on or intertwined with him. I couldn't trust him with anything. I certainly could not depend on him to be a father, and I was not going to do it myself.\nAs I walked into the clinic in Dallas, they were holding an anti-abortion rally outside its doors. I saw them approaching the young, scared, soon-to-be mothers entering and engaging them in persuasive conversation.\nNot me. I stood tall, was dressed in business clothes, and walked through that crowd like I was going on a sales call. Confident, scared to the root of my soul, ashamed, assured my decision was accurate. I'm pretty certain none of them expected a 44-year-old client.\nOnce inside, I was at peace. The waiting room was full of such young, scared girls. Some sat with their boyfriends, others with mothers or sisters, and some alone, just like me. I realized as we sat there waiting for our names to be called that we all had such different paths and stories that had led us to the exact same point. I somehow found peace in that.\nMy name was called, and I slipped into my gown. All the nurses were so kind and gentle and soft-spoken. The furniture, beds, and clinic were threadbare and reminiscent of the 1950s. But to me, it felt like a comfortable old blanket. Like grandma's house. Not fancy, but spotless and full of love and peace. I felt comfortable, safe, and unjudged.\nThe realization of seeing the tiny heartbeat and having the nurse assure me that I was, in fact, six weeks along was surreal. I could identify the night of conception. Oddly, I recalled thinking at the time that we should have used birth control that night. I had let my guard down.\nNext, the doctor came in. He was in his sixties and looked like he was tired of fighting the daily fight to perform procedures that are firmly protected by our constitution in 2007. He asked me why I was thinking about an abortion.\nI explained that I did not have a partner who gave two cents about me, how much I loved my career, and how I could not afford to give my job up to raise this child. I told him I had three beautiful adult sons, and that I was done with the child-rearing time in my life. I told him I had based my decision on logic, knowledge, and not fear.\nWhile recuperating in this warm, dark, soft, music-playing wardroom, I felt at peace. Nestled into my blankies alone with my thoughts, I knew I had made the right decision. Six hours later, I got up, got dressed, and walked out the door into the same crowd I'd walked past seven hours earlier.\nThey now knew. I knew they knew. Again, I strode past them, head high, my eyes up, confident that I had taken control of the rights of women to own their own bodies. Even now, as I write this as a reborn Christian, I do not know if I would have made a different choice.\nThat was my path—the same path that led me to Christ and the same Christ-driven path I am on today. Judge me. Applaud me. Pray for me. Cry for me. The choice is yours—just as the choice was mine.\nI do not believe abortion is birth control to be abused, but it should be an option. I believe women take on 100 percent of the responsibility for carrying a child and 70-90 percent of the care. There are great fathers out there who break that mold, but holistically, I believe that it is the mothers who raise the babies a lot of the time.\nIt seems impossible to believe that male birth control pills have not been invented to share the responsibility, but they haven't. When we find ourselves pregnant, we must act fast and trust our instincts.\nI believe that if a woman is pregnant, she alone may choose her destiny. Roe vs. Wade was signed into place to protect women in need of medical choices. With it being revoked in a number of states, we are casting shame on women needlessly as they franticly search out council facilities to end pregnancies.\nI am not justifying murder, but I am not doomed to eternal damnation because I sought an abortion. As a Christian, I believe that all sins are heinous, and all sins can be erased with Christ's mercy. If He didn't die for all sins, then his sacrifice on the cross was futile.\nMotherhood is a destiny and an honor. I would advise women to prayerfully decide when it is their turn to be mothers and to prayerfully make their own decisions.\nJoanne Richardson is President of Gailwinds Group LLC.

    "content": "There’s a new kind of “get ready with me” video trending in mainland China ­— one of “gross” work outfits.\nChina’s youth are donning their worst pajama bottoms, hairiest slippers and heading to the office in a tongue-in-cheek rebellion against everything from bad bosses and poor work conditions to low pay and long hours. And they’re gleefully showing off their creations online.\nFor months, Chinese social media users have posted under hashtags like #grossoutfitforwork #uglyclothesshouldbeforwork #ootd (outfit of the day) and are asking others to share their own takes, unleashing a competition of who wore it worst.\nThe hashtag “grossoutfitforwork” has attracted more than 140 million views and tens of thousands of discussions on Chinese social media platform Weibo alone. In late February, a post by Douyin (China’s version of TikTok) user Kendou S, claiming she was chastised by her boss about her “gross” outfits which said she wore to battle the cold weather, went viral.\nIn a follow-up video, liked 752,000 times and reposted over 1.4 million times, Kendou S shows off one of her offending outfits — revealing layer after layer of mismatched pieces — a fluffy white hat, gray balaclava, tatty red gloves, puffer coat, pink quilted jacket, fleece sweater dress, plaid pajama bottoms, fur-lined slippers and knee-high socks.\nIn response to similar posts, one woman who posted a picture of herself in a neon yellow vest and baggy knee-length shorts wrote: “My coworker says I dress like a wild man,” while another commenter showing off a dirty yellow and blue jacket said: “My boss gave me 50 yuan (about 7 dollars) to wash my clothes and I was forbidden to shake hands with clients ever again.”\n“Earning such little salary, with ugly coworkers, what else do you expect from my outfit?” read yet another post.\nAfter embracing “tang ping” or “lying flat,” a philosophy that rejects the rat race and consumerism in favor of a less stressful life, young Chinese people have thrown “resignation parties” and are even paid to become “full-time children.” “Gross outfits” appear to be the latest attempt by some disenchanted Gen Z to make a statement as the country sees gloomy economic prospects and record high youth unemployment rates.\nA post shared by CNN (@cnn)\nYoung people in China are graduating into a tough job market, with the government reporting in January that the jobless rate in December 2023 stood at 14.9% among 16- to 24-year-olds. This figure, which was published after a five-month hiatus, excluded 62 million full-time students. The figure had previously hit a high of 21.3% in June.\n“They’re kind of like, why bother when your work and future life prospect is not looking that bright,” said Bohan Qiu, the 29-year-old founder of the Boh Project, a Shanghai and Seoul based creative, public relations and brand consultancy for fashion brands and more. “Before they saw (working) as chasing a dream…and (companies) motivated everyone to fight for the (economic) pie. Now people are like: ‘No that doesn’t exist, or it could be a lie,’” said Qiu.\nWhile the examples that have gone viral on social media are more extreme, Qiu said he believes casual dressing for work has always been popular in China and will continue. This, he said, will especially be the case at workplaces where overtime and long hours in front of a computer are the norm, and also with a younger generation who became accustomed to working remotely during the pandemic.\nQiu added that while his staff don’t dress the way the people in the viral videos do, they do tend to dress down. Workers have been known to come in wearing sweatpants, shorts, slippers and the like, he said, and it’s been accepted “as long as they looked cool.”\nEven those posting their ugly outfits on social media don’t have a problem with looking good — outside the workplace. Many have posted that they just prefer the “banwei” or “stench of work” not be on their favorite clothes.\nAnd while China’s state-run media were quick to criticize the trend of “lying flat” or “letting it rot,” People’s Daily called the phenomenon of dressing ugly at work a kind of “self-deprecation” and said as long as employees “dress appropriately, have a correct work attitude, do not affect other people, and do not involve issues of principle,” there’s no problem.\nQiu who works in the fashion industry also finds himself dressing down after moving to Shanghai. He said many of the smart suits he wore in Hong Kong are now languishing deep in his closet.\nAnd as temperatures rise, some have started to share their gross outfits for the spring.\nOne Douyin user posted a picture of a particularly egregious combo: grubby mustard toe socks and broken black sandals with gaudy plastic baubles.\n",

    "content": "A mom has shared footage of her 5-year-old son eating a chicken nugget for the first time, saying it represents a significant breakthrough for her family.\nFor most families, a trip to Chick-fil-A is nothing to write home about. But it's different for Emily Marie Losier and son Dax, who live in Pennsylvania. Dax has autism spectrum disorder and struggles with what his mom terms \"extreme food aversion.\"\n\"Dax has a very sensitive gag reflex,\" Losier told Newsweek. \"So if he has it in his mind that he doesn't like something, no matter how it tastes, he will just throw up. I learned that lesson by trying to 'make' him taste something one time and one time only.\"\nLosier said Dax first started to refuse certain foods when he was 2. \"He would literally cover his hand with his mouth and from food he didn't want to try,\" she said. Instead, he insists on eating only what he considers \"comfortable, safe food.\"\n\"He absolutely loves spaghetti,\" Losier said. \"He would live on it. The only way I can get him to eat meat is ground beef in spaghetti sauce or sometimes a meatball or two. He also likes scrambled eggs, pizza, Mac 'n' cheese, french fries and most fruits. He loves watermelon.\"\nThis in itself makes life difficult for Losier as a mom trying to make sure her son enjoys a healthy and balanced diet. \"He does eat gummy daily vitamins, but I still worry about his long-term health,\" she said.\nAlso, Dax \"never feels full\" and will \"literally cry for more food that he likes no matter how much he's eaten,\" she said.\nBut what exacerbates the situation for Losier is the lack of understanding shown by many people.\nWhen she first uploaded the videos to TikTok detailing Dax's situation, some of the responses left her upset. \"I definitely feel like we need more awareness,\" Losier said. \"Some of my comment sections are so awful, telling me I should starve him or force him to eat, and it just is not that simple.\"\nBut Dax isn't alone in experiencing these struggles with food. Cherie Miller, an eating disorder psychotherapist, said he might have an eating disorder called avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), which is not an uncommon challenge for autistic kids.\n\"ARFID involves limitations in the amount and/or types of food a person will eat,\" Miller told Newsweek. \"There are three common subtypes of ARFID, and they have different reasons for the restriction: sensory sensitivities, fear of bad things happening—e.g., gagging, choking, vomiting—and a general lack of appetite and an apathy towards food.\"\nMiller said that while parents should seek the help of a therapist and dietitian specializing in eating disorders, as well as a pediatrician, parents can help address the problem.\n\"Treatment for these types of food issues in children does involve challenging kids to eat foods they are afraid to eat, but a gentle approach is best,\" she said. \"That means taking things slow to give kids time to learn coping skills to manage their anxiety and offering lots of support and encouragement.\"\nThat's another element of what made Dax's breakthrough with the chicken nugget so special. It came with the love and support of his mom, who offered quiet encouragement as he took those small but significant bites.\n\"I was nervous right before that he would throw up all over Chick-fil-A, but when he took that bite and chewed it up, I was incredibly proud of him,\" Losier said. \"He has had some other irrational fears that he has overcome recently—after much work—so I think that may have been boosting his confidence as well.\"\nLosier said she originally filmed the video to share it with her family. \"I was so excited after years of attempts by myself and my whole family to get him to try chicken that I wanted to video it.\"\nShe also wanted to thank the staff at the Westmoreland Mall branch of Chick-fil-A in Greensburg for providing the meal for free after learning about Dax's situation.\nLosier ended up posting the clip online, partly because she wanted to offer encouragement to other parents who may be in a similar position.\n\"I hope that it can give some hope to other parents struggling with the same issues,\" she said. \"Keep working with them. Keep offering. Be patient. You never know when they will wake up and decide that today they will say yes to tasting the chicken nugget.\"\n",

    "content": "In the Los Angeles restaurant where Nathaly Paola Castro Torres works, customers never fail to comment on her short stature.\n“People stare at me too much and make comments or jokes,” Torres, 42, said. “Many times they also (take) photos of me and I don’t like it. I feel very bad.”\nAt 4 feet, 2 inches tall (127 centimeters), Torres is a “little person” who isn’t used to such reactions. While she was growing up in Quito, Ecuador, people seldom mentioned her height. She worked at a car dealership, felt embraced by her community, and considered her size an advantage.\n“Since I was a teenager, I saw my height as (an opportunity) to develop — the growth problem is part of my personality,” Torres told CNN in Spanish.\n“I am also quite lucky because in reality my body protects me a lot from diseases that other people have every day,” she added. “This height, at the same time as being a limitation, is also a blessing.”\nTorres has a rare disorder called Laron syndrome that is caused by a genetic mutation. It stunts her growth but also provides a hidden silver lining: Her body is protected from chronic diseases such as cancer that often take life away long before old age.\n“I wonder what people who make fun of Nathaly would say if they knew she lived in a body that may some day provide information on how to live longer, disease-free lives,” said Valter Longo, professor of gerontology and biological sciences at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.\n“We have shown in studies people with Laron have a very low incidence of cancer, diabetes and cognitive decline,” said Longo, who has studied Laron syndrome for nearly 20 years. “Brain scans have shown they have more youthful brains — the equivalent of someone 20 years younger. I have yet to see a case of Alzheimer’s in this population.”\nRelated article\nExercise changes the brain in a way that helps heart health, especially for people with depression\nAnd according to a new study published Friday in the journal Med, Torres and other people who have the condition may also be protected from heart disease, Longo said.\n“It doesn’t mean that they are immune to these diseases, but people with Laron syndrome certainly seem to be very protected,” added Longo, who was a coauthor of the latest research. “This is how powerful this mutation seems to be.”\nThe first cases of little people who seemed to shrug off disease were identified in Israel in 1958 among children of Jewish immigrants from Yemen and other parts of the Middle East. Today, there may be between 350 and 500 people with Laron syndrome in the United States, Ecuador, Israel, Croatia, Ireland and other European countries, Longo said.\nIn 1987, Dr. Jaime Guevara-Aguirre, then a young physician just starting his career, discovered a group of about 100 people with Laron syndrome scattered across rural towns in Ecuador. Guevara-Aguirre, who was first author of the new report, is the founder of the Institute of Endocrinology, Metabolism, and Reproduction in Quito.\nThese people all carried a mutation in their human growth hormone receptor gene, according to Guevara-Aguirre’s research. That genetic disruption blocks the body’s ability to use insulin-like growth factor, or IGF-1, a hormone created primarily in the liver. Growth hormone and IGF-1 work together to promote normal bone and tissue growth, so a deficit stunts growth.\nPeople with Laron have IGF-1 in their tissues, where it can be called upon to help heal wounds and other body processes. However, unlike the rest of us, these folks have little of the hormone circulating in their bloodstream, where it wreaks  havoc and contributes to aging.\nFortunately, the lack of circulating IGF-1 also blocks the uncontrolled growth of cancer cells and creates an extra sensitivity to insulin that protects against diabetes.\nIn 2005, Guevara-Aguirre reached out to Longo, who had been studying a similar mutation in yeast cells that extended their existence.\n“In addition to yeast cells, worms, flies and mice with similar mutations all live extraordinarily long lives,” Longo said. “Mice with the same mutation we are studying in humans hold the record in longevity — they live 40% longer than mice without it, and 50% of those mice never develop any pathology. So they are living longer and healthier lives.”\nThe two began to collaborate, hoping they might identify a drug that could potentially be used to lower circulating IGF-1 in the general population and provide antiaging and disease-preventive benefits, Longo said.\n“The idea would be for people who have high circulating IGF-1 levels to get drugs that lower the IGF-1 back to the range that seems to be associated with the lowest mortality rate, much like people take a drug for high cholesterol,” Longo said.\nA Western diet packed with protein and sugar also increases circulating levels of IGF-1, thus hastening aging, Longo said.\n“There are IGF-1 lowering diets, such as fasting for five days a month, which is called a fasting-mimicking diet,” he said. “We have published studies which found circulating IGF-1 levels remained depressed for a while after doing this.”\nRelated article\nSmoking may lead to more belly fat, a new study suggests. Here’s why that’s concerning\nGuevara-Aguirre and Longo are also looking for funding to provide IGF-1-boosting injections to children in Ecuador born with Laron syndrome. Given during childhood to encourage height, the drugs could then be stopped to allow the mutation’s genetic protection against disease to take over.\n“So far, the (Ecuadorian) government and pharmaceutical companies will not pay for it,” Longo said. “We are having to do it more slowly with diet, and we have had a bit of success.”\nThere are health risks connected to Laron syndrome as well. The condition leads to extreme obesity, a trigger for diabetes, heart disease, cancer and other diseases. In addition, many of the people Longo studies “never exercise” and often drink, smoke and reside in disadvantaged communities without adequate health care, he said.\nInstead of dying from chronic diseases connected to obesity, however, there is an unusually high rate of alcohol- and accident-related deaths as well as convulsive disorders among the Laron population, he said.\nAnd because low levels of IGF-1 in those without the mutation have been linked in studies with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, “everybody assumed that people with Laron probably had a lot of heart and cardiovascular problems, too, especially considering their obesity,” he added.\nTo find out, Longo and Guevara-Aguirre examined Torres and 23 others with Laron syndrome and compared them with 27 of their first-degree relatives without the condition, most of whom live in Ecuador.\nRelated article\nA daily step goal may cut disease and death risk in even otherwise sedentary people, study finds\n“We found people with Laron certainly do not have an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease despite the fact that they are often obese and live in poor environments, and some markers of cardiovascular disease were even improved,” Longo said.\nPeople with Laron in the study had better insulin sensitivity, lower blood pressure and no heart rhythm disturbances — all positive outcomes, he said.\nIn addition, people with Laron syndrome had plaque deposits in their arteries of only 7% despite having high cholesterol, which typically leads to clogging of the arteries and a higher risk of heart attacks, stroke and other heart diseases.\nThe control group of first-degree relatives, who shared the same diet and lifestyle, had plaque deposits of 30%, Longo said.\nHowever, additional signs of cardiovascular wear and tear were absent from the study, leaving some questions unanswered, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver.\n“Still, I think it’s an interesting and promising study,” said Freeman, who was not involved in the research. “It lays the groundwork to see what we learn from this to reduce harms that affect people as they age.”\nTorres recently went to the doctor for a checkup. While technically overweight at 100 pounds (45.4 kilograms), she was in good health, with no signs of diabetes or heart disease.\n“(The doctor) tells me, ‘If you want, you can lose weight, but it’s not a health problem for you, you’re perfect,’” Torres said. “I feel very fortunate and find the response of my body to these other more serious diseases very interesting.”\nRelated article\nThis diet with exercise reduces dangerous belly fat and more, study says\nShe plans to stay in the United States to take advantage of educational opportunities and to see whether she “can get a chance for a better job, a career.” However, she said she misses her family and the ease of purchasing fresh fruits and vegetables abundant in Ecuador.\n“I learned is that even though my body is a little more adaptable, I still have to be careful with my diet,” she said. “Because although it is true that we have a health advantage over other people, we do not know for sure to what extent this will protect us.”\nShe also said she’s proud of her role in the research on Laron syndrome.\n“The objective is to be able to develop some medical help in order to help the rest of the people who struggle with diabetes and cancer, two of the most catastrophic diseases,” she said. “This is my hope.”\n",

    "content": "Florida A&M University is putting a purported $237.75 million donation “on pause,” after media reports and college board leaders raised concerns about the actual value of the stock gift—and the details surrounding the donor’s previous donations.\n“A decision that was made yesterday to put a pause on this activity—a hold, is more or less, is the language that was used—pending some additional information that has come to my attention,” FAMU President Larry Robinson said Thursday during an emergency school board meeting, called after media reports and school leaders raised concerns about the legitimacy of the gift.\nIt’s a stunning reversal from the fanfare last Saturday at FAMU’s commencement ceremony, when the announcement of the gift made headlines as one of the largest ever personal donations ever to a historically Black college or university.\nGregory Gerami, the 30-year-old CEO of Texas hydroponic hemp farm company Batterson Farms Corp., presented the $237.75 million stock gift via an oversized, ceremonial check to university administration members including Robinson, who called the gift “breathtaking in its generosity and its scope” via a press release the day of the donation.\nBut the jubilance quickly gave way to skepticism.\nA report from Politico noted Batterson Farms Corp. is a comparatively small company, and that its private shares are unlikely to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\nIn 2020, a notable deal involving a donor later identified as Gerami fell apart. South Carolina’s Coastal Carolina University had announced a $95 million donation from an anonymous donor, who then backed out months later. An investigation by the Myrtle Beach Sun News identified Gerami in a story that noted, among other details, that he backed out alleging racism from CCU officials—an allegation they denied.\nAt an emergency board meeting on Thursday, FAMU board of trustee and foundation members expressed their concerns and frustration about the school’s vetting process involving Gerami’s donation.\nSeveral members of the FAMU Foundation Board of Directors and Deveron Gibbons, the vice chair of the university’s Board of Trustees, said they were not informed of the donation until it was announced at commencement.\n“This meeting is taking place because no one, as I am aware of from this conversation, had any clue this was going on,” Gibbons told CNN. “We are talking about a transformational, largest in HBCU history donation: big check on stage, with press involved and big PR campaign push after the fact. If that doesn’t show that we need to take a step back and get our own house in order, I don’t know what else does.”\nGibbons has called for an independent investigation into the transaction.\n“I hope that this is a good gift. It could be transformative for the university and much needed. But we must vet the process, doing an announcement is not the first thing you do … Vet the individual. You vet the donation,” Vice Chair Gibbons said.\nBoard Chair Kristin Harper provided a statement to CNN on Friday saying, “Serious concerns have been raised regarding the validity of the gift, the adequacy of the due diligence processes and whether the Foundation Board and Board of Trustees have been provided ample oversight opportunity.”\n“I regrettably share these concerns” Harper added.\nOn May 5, just one day after the announcement at commencement, FAMU released a statement via X (formerly Twitter) insisting the university had done its “due diligence.” The statement went on to say that Gerami had transferred $237,750,000 of stocks into a FAMU account last month.\nA non-disclosure agreement requested by Gerami prohibited officials from disclosing the details to either the university’s board of trustees or the board of directors, Vice President for University Advancement Shawnta Friday-Stroud said during an emergency meeting Thursday.\n“In addition to the wealth screening that was done at the beginning, we did a more expansive screening of Mr. Gerami’s background,” Friday-Stroud said.\n“We had a discussion with Dr. Robinson, all of which has been put out on social media. We said, ‘ok, we will proceed with the decision to move forward,” Friday-Stroud added.\n“My concern is our reputation has been greatly impacted and I want to make sure that we restore faith in our alumni and all of the friends and family that support Florida A&M University,” said FAMU Foundation Board member Terry Arnold.\nWhen reached by CNN on Thursday, Gerami declined immediate comment.  He referred questions to the university and agreed to answer CNN’s questions on the following day, but he couldn’t be reached.\nFAMU’s Special Board of Trustees, which oversees the full school and the foundation, has scheduled a meeting for May 15 to discuss the donation.\nFAMU’s communications department did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on more detailed questions about the gift and the nature of the vetting process.\n",

    "content": "On the rare days that the hills surrounding Port-au-Prince fall silent, people notice.\n“If you can’t hear shooting somewhere, the gangs are probably running low on ammunition,” a police source in the Haitian capital told CNN. “But when there’s a lot of shooting, they’ve definitely received a fresh shipment.”\nFor over two months, Port-au-Prince has been cut off from the world, its international seaport and airport shuttered following an explosion of gang attacks in late February. All major roads are blocked by gang checkpoints. For most people living here, there is no way out – and no way to bring in desperately needed food and medicine.\nEncircling the Caribbean nation is another closed perimeter, this one created by Haiti’s neighbors. The Dominican Republic has sealed the island’s shared border and airspace. The Bahamas has launched a naval blockade to keep Haitians from fleeing the crisis by boat; the UK has sent a warship to ward off anyone seeking refuge in Turks and Caicos, a British overseas territory; and the US state of Florida has increased marine and aviation patrols.\nAnd yet guns, bullets and drugs keep pouring in, crossing international waters and airspace to reach the embattled country – most of the firepower originating from the US.\n“Haiti doesn’t produce guns and ammunition, yet the gang members don’t seem to have any trouble accessing those things,” says Pierre Esperance, executive director of Haiti’s National Human Rights Defense Network.\nSince the start of the year, thousands of people have been killed in gang-related violence and hundreds kidnapped, including at least 21 children, UN figures show. Stopping the flow of guns to Haiti would likely have an immediate impact on the bloodshed, according to police and human rights experts.\n“We have to cut the gangs’ weapons supply lines. This is absolutely the most important thing now,” the police source told CNN. “Because when they don’t have bullets, their machine guns become nothing more than clubs.”\nAnd as a Kenyan-led multinational security support force (MSS) prepares to deploy to Haiti, starving the gangs of ammunition should be a top priority for the US, says William O’Neill, the UN Designated Expert of the High Commissioner on the situation of Human Rights in Haiti.\n“All of these countries that are contributing their young men and women (to the MSS), how can we make it safer for them to do their job? One way the US could help immediately and directly would be to really seriously crack down on the flow of illegal weapons,” he said.\n“The gangs have literally nothing else; their only currency is intimidation and fear.”\nEighteen months ago, the UN Security Council imposed an arms embargo on Haiti, which bans the export of weapons to anyone in the country other than the government. The US has also taken independent steps to crack down on illicit exports, appointing a regional coordinator for firearms prosecution in the Caribbean and a special unit to investigate transnational crimes in Haiti.\nYet the guns keep coming. In January, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) warned that Haiti-bound firearms and ammunition were being “routinely incorporated into outbound shipments at warehouses near seaports and airports” in Florida, citing interviews with US customs officials.\nRelated article\nGangs forced out Haiti’s government. This FBI ‘Most Wanted’ gang leader claims they’re liberating the country\nThe following month, Haiti’s gangs put their weapons to devastating use, taking the country hostage in an explosion of coordinated violence that forced then-Prime Minister Ariel Henry to resign, and led to the creation of a transitional governing council that has so far been mired in disagreement.\n“The planes have not stopped flying. There continue to be exchanges of both ammunition and arms across the border,” Sylvie Bertrand, the UNODC regional representative, told CNN recently, urging the global community to enforce the arms embargo.\nBut amid today’s chaos, experts say it is likely becoming easier than ever for the gangs to resupply, as they now control major routes and infrastructure to bypass official controls.\n“There are always weapons coming in. There are always bullets,” Vitel’homme Innocent, leader of the Kraze Baryé gang, told CNN in April, his masked entourage bristling with a globally manufactured assortment of firepower.\nWeapons experts who later analyzed some of CNN’s images from the encounter said they could spot weapons and accessory parts originating from Israel, Turkey, the Czech Republic, probably Brazil – and, overwhelmingly, from the United States.\nThe guns Haiti’s gangs wield are a mix of stolen and smuggled, and the United States is by far the main source of the latter, according to UN experts.\nFrom 2020 to 2022, over 80% of the weapons seized in Haiti and submitted to US authorities for tracing were manufactured in or imported from the United States, UNODC reported in January, citing the most-recent available tracing data.  They are typically purchased in the US from federally licensed retail outlets, gun shows or pawn shops through “straw man” intermediaries, the agency also found.\nIt’s all part of a phenomenon that experts in Latin America and the Caribbean call the “iron river” – a flood of guns bought in US states with lax gun laws, and then shipped across the region to criminal groups. The Mexican government, which has been outspoken about the issue, currently has a $10 billion lawsuit pending against several US gun manufacturers whose products, it says, arm powerful cartels.\nA senior agent at the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), which investigates the diversion of lawfully purchased guns to illegal ends, told CNN that Miami is a significant source of weapons sent to Haiti, which have historically been trafficked in small freighters by family networks.\n“Those are difficult to enforce because they’re not your typical commercial freighter… it’s relatively easy to conceal a small number of firearms in those shipments,” he said. Texas, Louisiana, and Georgia are also sources of weapons trafficked to the Caribbean, where the ATF has a specialized gun intelligence unit to track and stop such flows, he added.\nAsked whether the US was doing enough, he emphasized that combatting gun trafficking was a top priority. “It is a very high priority of the United States government and ATF’s role in that, to stem the flow of illegal firearms, whether domestic or international, and particularly places like Haiti where the rule of law is under extreme threat.”\nIn January, Joly Germine – leader of the gang 400 Mawozo – pleaded guilty to US charges over a gunrunning scheme that saw dozens of rifles, handguns and a shotgun purchased legally in Florida under false pretenses, and smuggled into Haiti.\nFrom above, traces of Haiti’s extensive smuggling networks come into focus: the scars of a clandestine airstrip in its sun-bleached Central Plateau, a dock jutting from gang-held territory into the still waters of the Gulf of Gonave.\nSea and air are the main means of transport for the guns and the drugs trans-shipments that fund more weapons purchases, experts say. And while Haitian authorities have seen some successes in seizing illicit cargo over the years, the dramatic peaks and plains of this “land of mountains” add difficulty for an already understaffed police force and customs agency.\nHaiti’s secluded and sparsely populated rural areas are ideal for landings and take-offs by small planes aiming to avoid observation. There are at least 11 known informal or clandestine airstrips in the country, according to UNODC, many originally built for humanitarian purposes following the country’s devastating 2010 earthquake.\n“Here, you don’t have anything around you. So, you just go, probably in the middle of the night, with a couple vehicles parked on each side of the improvised runway so the pilot can identify the area. They land, drop off or pick up stuff, and take off again all outside of Haitian jurisdiction,” a security expert in Port-au-Prince told CNN.\nThe sea is the preferred option for arms smugglers given the weight of their cargo. Haiti’s roughly horseshoe shape offers over 1,100 miles of coastline, a challenging distance to comprehensively patrol for Haiti’s coast guard.\nHaiti’s south in particular has emerged as a strategic location for smugglers, the UNODC reported in April, offering entry points for cocaine from South America, cannabis from Jamaica and firearms from across the region.\n“One popular method of moving illegal products involves “banana boats,” go-fast vessels that arrive at night, beach on coastal banana plantations, and are subsequently destroyed after unloading their cargo,” the UNODC report details.\nGuns and ammunition that arrive in the south are frequently sent onward to Port-au-Prince via the gang-controlled Route National 3, it also said, identifying the Mariani gang, Grand Ravine gang, and 5 Segond gang as “major players in the organization and distribution of arms, munitions and drugs.”\nIn 2022, 5 Segond group attacked Haiti’s largest flour mill. It would have been an incongruous target if not for its location, positioned right next to Port-au-Prince Bay with a large jetty to accept deliveries. Just about a mile inland lies a major highway, and in between the two is a massive warehouse; a perfect distribution set-up for any import entrepreneur.\nToday, the entire area is controlled by 5 Segond, with security sources telling CNN that they believe the mill has been taken over and no longer functions.\n“Izo has the jetty, so he has access to the sea. And boats keep coming in and out of that area, which again is completely controlled by his gang… and is kept under tight control, with barricades in the surroundings,” the same security expert said, referring to 5 Segond’s rapper frontman Andre Johnson, who often posts videos of gang members flashing guns and paramilitary gear set to music on social media.\nContraband arriving via secretive small boats and planes is just part of the picture. Last month, Haitian National Police and Customs agents seized more than two dozen firearms, including 12 assault rifles, and nearly a thousand cartridges from a shipping container that had arrived in Haiti’s northern city of Cap Haitien.\nDrugs and arms smuggling has a long history in Haiti, much of it facilitated through official channels by government agents and even, in one 2022 case, by a rogue Episcopal church staffer who allegedly hid guns and thousands of rounds in a shipping container reportedly labeled as church donations, before it was seized by customs agents in Port-au-Prince.\nCustoms officials trying to do their job on the front lines in Haiti can face threats to their lives. In 2018, local press reported that several customs agents at the Malpasse border crossing between the Dominican Republic and Haiti were burned alive after an argument erupted in the course of a cargo inspection.\nAllegations of smuggling and gang affiliations have also been made at the highest levels of Haiti’s government. Four former Haitian senators have been sanctioned by the US for alleged drug trafficking, as have multiple past presidents and prime ministers of Haiti for allegedly financing the country’s gangs. They’re part of what gang leader Innocent refers to as the country’s “oligarchs,” who historically created and armed local gangs to become their enforcers-for-hire as they profited from white-collar crime schemes.\n“As a Haitian human rights defender, I can’t say that all the responsibility for these guns is on the US – I think it’s the Haitian government too. They need to regain control of the port, they need to control customs. The problem is corruption,” says Esperance, the human rights advocate.\nRelated article\nHunger in Haiti is spreading amid gang violence, aid workers warn\nThat’s why, he says, the planned deployment of an international police force to restore calm to Haiti is destined to fail unless the US and global community also commit to fighting corruption, building frameworks for good governance, and closing legal loopholes abused by the country’s elite.\n“Now, of course, the government is completely destabilized, it’s easy for the gangs to smuggle weapons themselves. But how did they begin? Just two years ago, smuggling was going through official channels, and it happened that way because everyone was corrupt,” Esperance said.\nBertrand, the UNODC representative, also emphasized the importance of building up Haiti’s institutions as its new government takes shape. Her agency is working to strengthen the country’s customs authority and coast guard, for example, including providing much-needed equipment from protective gear to cargo scanners.\n“It’s time for people in Haiti to live peacefully – for their kids to go back to school, for them to be able to eat every day.” And that means, she says, ensuring that “national authorities are well-trained, well-equipped, and ready to face and curb down the level of violence.”\nCNN reached out to Homeland Security Investigations, part of the US Department of Homeland Security; the US Department of Commerce’s Office of Export Enforcement, Haiti’s National Police and Haiti’s General Customs Administration for comment.\n",

    "content": "In 2013, I rented my first apartment, wrote my first resume, and eventually started my first (minimum-wage) job. I was 25 years old, inexperienced, and completely uneducated in how to be an independent woman.\nI had just left the Christian patriarchy movement, where I had been a stay-at-home daughter, living the Quiverfull lifestyle exhibited by the Duggar family.\nSince I hadn't been allowed to have a job outside the home, the only way I could make money was by teaching piano lessons, mostly to other homeschool families. And since I wasn't allowed to go to college, I studied piano pedagogy textbooks on my own to learn how to be a better teacher.\nI became resourceful despite my restrictions, and that's how I eventually escaped and started my life over, as I've written about in my new book, Rift: A Memoir of Breaking Away from Christian Patriarchy.\nI thought I had left that oppressive world behind, but now, more than a decade later, I see the #tradwife trend on social media, and it's bringing everything back—the glorification of traditional gender roles that were never as shiny as they appear with photo filters and curated vintage clothing.\nScrolling through TikTok, I see videos of women in long floral dresses. Their hair is perfectly curled, and they are cooking or gardening or creating crafts for their children. One thing is a constant: They are always at home.\nThese videos use the hashtag #tradwife, \"trad\" standing for \"traditional.\" And while this nickname is new, the content is not. In fact, it's deeply familiar to me as someone who was raised to become a traditional wife.\nBut the stay-at-home life is not as glamorous as it looks on TikTok and Instagram.\nBack in the 1990s and early 2000s, when I was being homeschooled and taught the beliefs of \"biblical patriarchy,\" we didn't have the term \"tradwife,\" and I likely wouldn't have been allowed to watch TikTok videos anyway.\n\"Traditional marriage,\" \"biblical womanhood,\" and \"Quiverfull\" were the terms we most often used to describe our lifestyle, which was founded on Christian fundamentalism.\nChristian or biblical patriarchy is an ideology and religious movement centered around the idea that God is masculine, the ultimate patriarch, which is why men were \"created\" to be leaders in the home, church, and government.\nWomen were called to be homemakers, submitting to their fathers until they married, when they would then submit to their husbands. Men and women had to conform to strictly distinct gender roles.\nAs a homeschooled kid, I was taught many typical subjects, or at least given books about them, but my focus was to grow up and become a stay-at-home wife and mother. I became proficient in cooking, sewing, and cleaning.\nAnything I was taught was framed as something I could use to benefit my future family. Learning math was so that I could help my future husband do his taxes. Learning to play piano was so I could accompany hymn singing.\nI was allowed to skip science one year because it wasn't \"necessary.\"\nWhen I turned 18, I didn't go to college or get a job. I was called a \"stay-at-home daughter\" because I was in training to be a wife. My father told me that I didn't need an education or a career because it wouldn't help me in my calling and would tempt me away from God's righteous path.\nHomemaking was glorified as the ideal calling for women. Instead of video-sharing apps, we had Vision Forum catalogs where gender-specific toys were sold and glossy photographs of girls in frilly dresses and boys in Colonial hunting garb were shown to create an aesthetic of \"the good old days\" when men and women had separate gender roles. Books like So Much More and The Excellent Wife and magazines like Above Rubies and Patriarch extolled this lifestyle as one of beauty and divine purpose.\nSo watching #tradwife content is hauntingly familiar to me. These are not new ideas. It is the same old patriarchy wearing a different dress.\nJust like some of these creators say in their videos, I was also told this lifestyle was a choice, that I wasn't being forced into it. At the same time, I was restricted from outside information, prohibited from going to college, and not allowed to have a job outside the home.\nTheoretically, I could have moved out and chosen my own path, but as someone with limited life skills and insufficient finances, I had no idea how to actually do that when I turned 18.\nNot to mention that going against these gender restrictions would have been \"sinful\" and \"ungodly,\" marking me as an outsider to my family and church. So, even though I was \"choosing\" to be a stay-at-home daughter, I didn't really have any other option.\nToday, when I hear content creators sharing about how they choose to stay home and then say they submit to their husbands in the same video, I understand the dynamics at play behind the scenes.\nThe very concept of submission is that you are giving up your decision-making to someone else. If you \"choose\" to be a stay-at-home wife and give up all financial independence, you are placing yourself in a position where you won't have any choice in the future.\nThese videos are known for their ultra-feminine clothing and cozy cooking tutorials, but underlying many of them is a more disturbing ideology: That a woman is fulfilling her God-given purpose if she is a traditional wife who stays home and submits to her husband.\nAdding the promise of divine blessing to a lifestyle choice makes it more of a command than an act of true consent.\nOne #tradwife content creator named Estee recently shared a video of advice for high school girls who want to become traditional wives one day. \"Stay home as long as you possibly can,\" she says.\nShe goes even further by saying: \"If you want to be a traditional wife in the future, you don't need to go to college.\" In another video, Estee says women don't need prenups if they marry the right man because they can trust him not to betray the relationship. Instead, prayer is the best safeguard against divorce.\nAnother content creator named Jasmine Dinis says in one video that she is teaching her young daughter \"it's perfectly acceptable to depend on a man...that serving her husband and bearing children will be her greatest joy.\" Another video of hers proclaims, \"I used to be really into politics but now I just relax while my husband tells me what to think.\"\nThese words are so familiar that they trigger long-ago memories of being indoctrinated to believe that my only purpose was to be a wife and mother who didn't \"need\" a job or independent thoughts.\nAs I was in my twenties, unmarried and waiting for my father to help me find the perfect husband, I became deeply depressed and felt purposeless.\nServing men didn't bring me true happiness or fulfillment. I wanted to be my own person, but that would have gone directly against the mission to make me a submissive wife.\nAnd I had witnessed many women getting married and having extremely difficult lives as homemakers. They struggled with poverty, impossible expectations, domestic abuse, lack of bodily autonomy, burnout, and shame.\nAbove all, their lack of choice and true agency kept them trapped in unhealthy marriages.\nAnd while the #tradwife trend is fascinating to watch and even aesthetically pleasing for viewers who crave a slower lifestyle, it points to a deeper misogyny in our culture and a dangerous shift toward authoritarianism in American politics, one where women are encouraged to stay home, men are made to be the sole providers, and girls grow up believing they will be better off not having any real decision-making power in their lives.\nGirls like me.\nBut I know change is possible. I found a way to escape, and I will never willingly give up my agency for anyone.\nI'm sharing my story to prevent this kind of suffering in others because while being a stay-at-home [fill in the blank] is a valid choice for many, giving up your agency to submit to a spouse can lead to devastating consequences.\nWhen I tell girls they can be whoever they want, I'm really saying those words to myself, because after decades of being made to feel like I could only be a helpmate, I still need reminding that I have a voice.\nCait West is a writer and editor based in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

The list then included the American flag but noted that it was approved \"on holidays such as Memorial Day, Flag Day, July 4th, Veteran's Day, Patriots Day, etc.\"\n\"If other occasions come up where team members would like the opportunity for personal expression, please consult with your GM and/or line manager,\" the memo said.\nHowever, in a statement to Newsweek on Wednesday, a spokesperson for 24 Hour Fitness said: \"Currently and historically, 24 Hour Fitness' policy regarding staff expression has allowed and encouraged wearing symbols like American flag pins any day of the year, including prominent national holidays like Memorial Day, Flag Day, July 4th, and Veterans Day.\"\nThe internal memo's lines regarding the display of the American flag prompted widespread backlash from many who claimed the gym was limiting the use of the flag.\n\"Internal memo from 24 hour fitness @24hourfitness advises that BLM and pride symbols are always approved forms of \"freedom of expression\" but the American Flag and US logos are only allowed to be worn on Holidays,\" Libs of TikTok wrote on X.\nConservative commentator Charlie Kirk said: \"Boycott the anti-America 24 Hour Fitness until they're chapter 11. Many superior options. End them.\"\nX user DC Draino wrote: \"Time to boycott 24 Hour Fitness. Woke garbage.\nFormer NFL sideline reporter Michele Tafoya responded by saying: \"Can customers of @24hourfitness wear a cross on a necklace? A Star of David? Red, white, and blue?\"\nX user Sarah Sansoni said: \"I hope everyone that is a member of @24hourfitness shows up today in head to toe American flag gear to personally cancel their memberships. Absolute shame on #24hourfitness. Does this corporation need to be educated on exactly what BLM is? Or American history? Or the constitution?\"\nIn recent months, many conservatives have called for boycotts of other companies, such as Bud Light, which faced widespread criticism over its partnership with Dylan Mulvaney, a transgender activist and influencer.\nIn March, Planet Fitness faced a similar boycott after reports of a 2023 incident involving a man who allegedly exposed himself to a 15-year-old while in a women's locker room. Planet Fitness revoked the membership of Patricia Silva after she photographed another gym member shaving in the women's locker room. The other gym-goer is transgender, with Silva protesting the woman's presence in a video shared to Facebook.\nAccording to Planet Fitness' non-discrimination policies, the chain does not \"tolerate verbal or physical harassment of any member or team member for any reason.\"\nA spokesperson for Planet Fitness told local media that because Silva took an image of a person inside a locker room, it violated the company's mobile device policy and goes against the gym's \"judgment-free\" rules.\nUpdate 6/12/24, 2 p.m. ET: This story has been updated with a new headline a statement from 24 Hour Fitness.\n",

    "content": "Images snapped from space show the spectacular patterns formed by sea ice floating on the ocean currents\nThe pictures, taken by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA's Terra satellite on June 4 this year, show tiny fragments of sea ice drifting on the waves along the coast of Greenland.\nThe ebbs and flows of the ocean currents seem to have woven the ice into spiral-like patterns, like snowflakes in a blizzard.\nThe ice is thought to have originated from the Arctic Ocean, having traveled south via the 280-mile-wide Fram Strait to reach the eastern coast of Greenland. It will then have been swept to the south by the East Greenland Current, melting into smaller and smaller fragments as it goes. Some of the smallest chunks in the image may only be tens of feet across.\n\"The smaller the floes, the more 'wispy' the patterns,\" Walt Meier, a sea ice scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), said in a NASA Earth Observatory statement.\nWinds from the Greenland Ice Sheet then blow the fragments around, forming the spirals shown in the picture.\n\"With the thinning and breaking up of the ice, it becomes more easily pushed around by the winds and current,\" Meier said.\nThere are several types of sea ice, including first-year ice, which forms and melts within a single year, and multiyear ice, which survives through multiple summer melt seasons and is thicker and more resilient. The larger fragments seen in the picture likely formed along the coast near where they are currently seen, having not yet been broken up by the journey.\nRecently, less sea ice has been making its way out of the Arctic Ocean along this route due to the effects of climate change, which have made Arctic sea ice thinner.\n\"Historically, when more of the Arctic sea ice would survive the summer melt season, growing thicker and older, a larger volume of sea ice would be transported through the Fram Strait,\" Angela Bliss, a sea ice scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said in the NASA statement.\nThe extent and thickness of sea ice off Greenland have been declining over recent decades due to climate change, contributing to the overall reduction in Arctic sea ice. Rising temperatures are causing more rapid melting of sea ice, leading to longer ice-free periods in summer and delayed freezing in winter.\nThis reduced flow of sea ice past Greenland may impact ocean circulation patterns that rely on this annual movement, causing knock-on effects across the globe.\n\"Less ice and freshwater transport have big implications for ocean productivity, as well as warming upper ocean temperatures, in the region,\" said Bliss.\nDo you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?

    "content": "Nine hours and 30 minutes ahead of New York. Five hours and 30 minutes ahead of London. Three hours and 30 minutes behind Tokyo.\nFor more than a century, India’s clocks have officially fallen short of the full hour in calculating any time difference it has with most countries.\nAnd while it is part of a small group of nations and territories that shares that 30-minute gap - including Iran, Myanmar and parts of Australia - India is perhaps the most unlikely outlier.\nThe huge South Asian nation geographically spans what would normally be two time zones, but much to the frustration of some groups, it clings to its unusual clock settings, refusing to part ways with a system that has a very complicated past.\nIndia’s half-hour zone dates back to colonial rule of India and the era when ever-faster steamships and trains were shrinking the world.\nUntil the 19th century, India - like most places around the world - operated on very localized times, which were often different not just from city to city, but from village to village. But playing a key role in the background was East India Company, a ruthless and powerful British-owned trading organization that gradually seized control of large parts of the subcontinent.\nThe East India Company was managing the one of Asia’s first observatories, in Madras (now known as Chennai) by 1792. A decade later, the first official astronomer at this observatory declared Madras time to be “the basis of Indian Standard Time.”\nIt took a few decades, the advent of steam-powered locomotives and the commercial interests of the East India Company to make that stick, though.\n“The railroads had immense sway over the colonial powers,” says Geoff Gordon, a senior researcher in public international law at the University of Amsterdam.\n“Before the railroads won the contest for Madras time, there was a contest among the powerful cities – Bombay, Kolkata,” adds Gordon. “That fight didn’t last long.”\nMeanwhile, similar debates around the world, driven by the need to better coordinate transcontinental rail travel and improve maritime navigation, led to the establishment of the first international time zones at a conference in Washington D.C. in 1884.\nThe zones were based around the Greenwich Meridian, a line of longitude that runs north-south through the Greenwich Observatory in London. Time zones to the east of the Meridian are typically later than Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) in hourly increments.\nIt took a while for the system to be adopted globally. In India, people were still arguing over Madras Time. Despite the time’s adoption by the country’s railways, it faced considerable opposition from workers and local communities unwilling to have rigid new timings imposed on them.\n“There’s less room to maneuver as your working rhythms are linked up no longer with your boss down the street, the church bell, and the 20 other people that you go to work with,” says Gordon. “But it’s now determined by the railroad that arrives once a day.”\nEventually, Madras Time was established nationwide by 1905, with only a few remaining holdouts.\nThe start of the 20th century saw some push from scientific associations to calibrate India’s time to GMT.\nThe Royal Society in London proposed two time zones for India, both in full-hour increments from GMT and one another: Six hours ahead of GMT for the east and five hours for the west of the country.\nThat recommendation was rejected by the colonial government, which opted for a unified time that sat squarely in the middle: five and a half hours ahead of GMT.\n“It strikes me as sort of typical of the colonial mindset,” says Gordon.\nAnd so, in 1906, India’s British rulers introduced what is now known as Indian Standard Time.\nWhile the 30-minute difference is a lingering remnant of India’s colonial past, some countries have changed their own time zones more recently.\nVenezuela’s former president Hugo Chávez set clocks back by half an hour in 2007 to give schoolchildren more daylight time, a move that was later reversed by current leader Nicolas Maduro.\nIn 2015, North Korea moved out of sync with South Korea by creating “Pyongyang Time,” putting the country eight and a half hours ahead of GMT instead of nine.\nIndia’s colonial-era time zone decision making, however, reflected a chorus of political, scientific and commercial voices both from within the government and outside of it, Gordon says.\nHe compares India during this period to “Brazil,” the 1985 dark dystopian sci-fi fantasy film directed by Terry Gilliam, or the comically complicated contraptions drawn by US cartoonist Rube Goldberg.\n“It’s just this unbelievably haphazard Rube Goldberg-esque construction, that is built up through lots of different inputs, lots of people acting opportunistically, lots of people acting naively,” he adds. “There was a lot of weirdness and wildness.”\nIndia’s single time-zone has been the subject of much debate over the years, with populations in the northeast demanding a separate time zone given how wide the country is.\nThough this problem isn’t unique to India: geographically, China is the third largest in the world and still only has one time zone, which a 2014 study argues is symbolic of the state’s centralized control over people’s everyday lives.\nIndia’s official timekeepers, the National Physical Laboratory, even called for two separate time zones on account of this issue, citing reports of India’s time “badly affecting” the lives of people in the northeast.\nIt proposed two time zones instead: five and a half hours ahead of GMT for one side of India, and six and a half hours for another, specifically what they’ve described as “extreme northeast regions,” including areas like Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.\n“Despite geographical differences—such as the sun rising and setting nearly two hours earlier in the northeast compared to Gujarat—both regions adhere to the same time-zone,” says Maulik Jagnani, an assistant professor of economics at Tufts University.\nJagnani published a widely cited paper in 2019 highlighting the impact of sunlight on natural circadian rhythms in India, with a focus on children.\n“This setup affects children’s sleep patterns […] children exposed to later sunsets go to bed later,” adds Jagnani. “Fixed school and work start times do not allow for corresponding adjustments in wake-up times, leading to reduced sleep and poorer educational outcomes.”\nThe NPL also recognized this issue, adding that the circadian rhythm’s impact on health and work efficiency, is tied to the “overall socio-economic development of the region.”\nHowever, it looks like India’s unusual time zone is here to stay. When the question of introducing two time zones was put to India’s parliament in 2019, a government committee rejected the concept over unspecified “strategic reasons.”\n",

She is competent but a sovereign citizen and refuses to participate in the process,\" the dismissal notice said. \"She has been incarcerated longer than any active sentence that could be reasonably be expected given the charges and her prior record level. On review, these charges are being dismissed in the interests of justice.\"\nThe offenses dropped included a trespass charge, resisting, and assaulting a government official.\nCase documents reveal that last July an officer was called to a home in a Charlotte neighborhood by the power company who were there to remove a power meter and were told to leave by Ninti El-Bey, who was in the property, but had been evicted. When the officer arrived, El-Bey refused to engage with them and \"barricaded\" into the home, the case documents reveal. Upon being told she was under arrest, El-Bey resisted and a scuffle broke out between her and the officer.\n\"After fighting and actively trying to resist and get away, the defendant was placed into custody,\" the arrest sheet said. \"Since the defendant was evicted and came back onto the property the defendant is to be charged with first degree trespass...and assault on a government official.\"\nCase documents show that the property that El-Bey had been staying at was \"locked\" by local authorities.\n\"Any person who enters upon this trailer lot without the express permission of the landlord may be charged with violation of the North Carolina Criminal Statues,\" the ejectment notice dated April 2022 included in the case file said.\nThe American Apartment Owners Association describes a squatter as anyone who occupies a property they have no legal right to.\nIn response to a request for comment, the Mecklenburg County District Attorney's office referred Newsweek to the case documents.\nNewsweek also contacted the area public defender's office for comment via email and a phone call.\nEight years ago, El-Bey was convicted of trespassing in what reports alleged that she had squatted in a property in the Charlotte neighborhood of Piper Glen, according to The Charlotte Observer. The home was vacant and occupied 5,200 square feet in what the outlet described as \"one of south Charlotte's finest neighborhoods.\"\nEl-Bey had moved into the house that boasted five bedrooms and five bathrooms which at the time was valued at $800,000, according to the newspaper.\nA judge found El-Bey guilty of first- and second-degree trespassing and breaking and entering, among other charges, and gave her a suspended sentence of 45 days in jail.\nSquatting as a phenomenon has garnered national attention after high-profile incidents of individuals occupying homes they may have no legal rights to. But experts also warn that these cases are rare and some landlords are abusing the issue's presence in the public sphere to deny rights to residents who may have legitimate claims. But lawmakers have attempted to pass legislation to mitigate against such cases.\n",

    "content": "Melinda French Gates, one of the world’s preeminent philanthropists, said Monday she would resign as co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation that she has helped lead since 2000.\nThe foundation has made nearly $78 billion worth of grant payments in the nearly 25 years since its founding.\nFrench Gates made the decision “after considerable reflection, based on how she wants to spend the next chapter of her philanthropy,” the foundation’s CEO, Mark Suzman, wrote in a statement Monday. “Melinda has new ideas about the role she wants to play in improving the lives of women and families in the U.S. and around the world. And, after a difficult few years watching women’s rights rolled back in the U.S. and around the world, she wants to use this next chapter to focus specifically on altering that trajectory.”\nAs part of her separation agreement from former husband Bill Gates, French Gates said she will receive an additional $12.5 billion for her charitable work.\n“This is not a decision I came to lightly,” she said in a statement posted on X. “I am immensely proud of the foundation that Bill and I built together and of the extraordinary work it is doing to address inequities around the world.”\nFrench Gates said she plans to leave the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation on June 7, and she will share more about her future charitable plans in the near future.\nThe organization will change its name to the Gates Foundation, and Bill Gates will become the sole chair, Suzman said.\n“I am sorry to see Melinda leave, but I am sure she will have a huge impact in her future philanthropic work,” wrote Bill Gates in a separate statement Monday, also posted on X.\n“Looking ahead, I remain fully committed to the Foundation’s work across all our strategies, and to realizing the opportunities we have to continue improving the lives of millions around the world,” he wrote.\nFrench Gates’ exit had been telegraphed for several years. Bill Gates and French Gates announced their divorce in May 2021. They said at the time they would allow themselves a kind of trial period through 2023 to determine if they could continue working with one another to oversee their massive charitable foundation.\nSuzman announced in July 2021 a contingency plan “to ensure the continuity of the foundation’s work.”\n“If after two years either decides they cannot continue to work together as co-chairs, French Gates will resign her position as co-chair and trustee,” Suzman said.\nGates will remain in control and, essentially, buy French Gates out of the foundation, Suzman said at the time. French Gates would receive “personal resources” from Gates for her own philanthropic work — resources that would be “completely separate from the foundation’s endowment.”\nIn January 2022, the foundation announced four new members to its board of trustees to help bolster the foundation’s governance in the wake of the divorce. It marked the first time the Gates foundation added outsiders to the charity’s board in its two-decade history. The charity had no trustees beside Bill and Melinda French Gates since Bill Gates Sr.’s death in 2020 and Warren Buffett’s resignation in June 2021 after 15 years on the board.\n“I want to reassure you that the millions of people our work serves and the thousands of partners we work alongside can continue to count on the foundation,” said Suzman in a post on the foundation’s website Monday afternoon. “The foundation today is stronger than it has ever been.”\n“I know we all wish Melinda the best in her next chapter,” he added, noting that French Gates “will not be bringing any of the foundation’s work with her when she leaves.”\nThe $75.2 billion Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s mission is to improve health care in developing countries, enhance educational opportunities and reduce poverty by providing grants and support to various initiatives and organizations around the world.\nFrench Gates also founded Pivotal Ventures, a separate charity that focuses on removing barriers for minorities and women in the United States, in 2015. She committed $1 billion to the organization in 2019.\nThe Microsoft cofounder and French Gates have both pledged to donate the vast majority of their wealth to the foundation as well as to other philanthropic endeavors.\nIn an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria in January, Gates said he and partners like Buffett have given away about $100 billion into the foundation. With plans to spend $9 billion a year, Gates anticipates he’ll have given away all of his money in about 20 years.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments and context.\nCNN’s Nicole Goodkind, Allison Morrow and Jenn Korn contributed to this report.\n",

I wondered what would happen once her arms, then as firm and toned as Michelle Obama's, succumbed to age and gravity.\nOver the course of a few decades, I suspected the ink would fade, Bugs would become piebald as age spots appeared. That preadolescent prankster would become a portly provocateur. \"What's up Doc?\" would take on more somber undertones. Rabbits are not rodents, but it would be hard to tell the difference. How will she explain the fat rat on what remains of her deltoid?\nMy daughter, Lydia, started planning her tattoos when she was 13. The intricate drawing would be inked on the back of her slender neck. She might've shaved her head again to show it off, or kept it secret under a veil of hair—blue, purple, or natural soft brown with sun-kissed highlights. In Maryland, it was illegal to tattoo a minor so I didn't worry about it. It was a very nice design.\nWhen Lydia ended her life before she was old enough to get her coveted tattoo, my son Daniel, 12 years old, designed a memorial tattoo in her honor. He refined his original artwork and had it inked when he was 18, a freshman in college. It's quite large and colorful, although after two decades, not as vibrant as it once was.\nBy this time, many female friends had tattoos, ranging from a tiny wrist butterfly, a delicate rose above the breast, to a giant tramp stamp that lunged like a baleen whale out of the seat of tight, low-cut jeans.\nFascinating. I wanted to know all about every bit of body art I saw. It turns out, people are happy to tell their tattoo stories. Some are funny, many heartbreaking, all anthology-worthy.\nThinking about getting a tattoo of my own, I considered Lydia's name, maybe on my hip, because I'd carried her there when she was a baby. Not for long though—my independent child demanded to be put down, to do her earthly research untethered.\nI thought again of age and gravity, envisioning myself being turned and bathed by surly underpaid caregivers in a tight, ammonia-scented room. They'd see the name on my hip and assume I'm another old lesbian—maybe they'll laugh. We've all seen those videos of nursing home abuse. But, as usual, I digress.\nFor two decades, I never got around to getting that tattoo. But I've decided I want one and refuse to die before I get it. At 70, with a family history heavy with heart attack, stroke, and breast cancer, I figured it was time.\nI stopped at a red light and impulsivity struck like 220 volts. I typed tattoo into my GPS. There was a place 2.2 miles away. Lydia loved palindromes so I had no choice.\nMy tattoo idea was not unique. The tiny semicolon, sometimes enhanced with butterfly wings, cat whiskers, or musical notes has, like a team sweatshirt, has become the designated identification for membership in the club of people bereaved by suicide.\nThe Semicolon Project started in 2013 when Amy Bleuel's idea took root and the semicolon became the universal logo for mental health and suicide prevention. The tagline was \"Your story isn't over.\"\nMy tattoo artist proudly mansplained the use of the semicolon. He'd learned that using one in the first paragraph of any paper he wrote in college meant a guaranteed A. Such power wielded the little period-comma combo that it could stop a sentence from ending.\nAbout to be on the receiving end of the buzzing needle, I smiled. I didn't tell him what my desire to have one inked on my arm meant to me. Or that for many, it symbolizes the choice to continue living. A reminder of strength and perseverance. A signal to some that we are kindred.\nMonths after getting my tattoo, I sometimes startle catching a glimpse of it on my wrist. Seeing it upside down, it resembles a giant ant. Abdomen, thorax, antenna. Ever hypervigilant, I jump or swipe at it and I imagine how Lydia would be amused. Because although her life has ended, as long as I'm here to tell it, her story is not over. And neither is mine. I'm thinking about my next tattoo.\nEileen Vorbach Collins is an author and writer.
