        "content": "Melinda French Gates, one of the world’s preeminent philanthropists, said Monday she would resign as co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation that she has helped lead since 2000.\nThe foundation has made nearly $78 billion worth of grant payments in the nearly 25 years since its founding.\nFrench Gates made the decision “after considerable reflection, based on how she wants to spend the next chapter of her philanthropy,” the foundation’s CEO, Mark Suzman, wrote in a statement Monday. “Melinda has new ideas about the role she wants to play in improving the lives of women and families in the U.S. and around the world. And, after a difficult few years watching women’s rights rolled back in the U.S. and around the world, she wants to use this next chapter to focus specifically on altering that trajectory.”\nAs part of her separation agreement from former husband Bill Gates, French Gates said she will receive an additional $12.5 billion for her charitable work.\n“This is not a decision I came to lightly,” she said in a statement posted on X. “I am immensely proud of the foundation that Bill and I built together and of the extraordinary work it is doing to address inequities around the world.”\nFrench Gates said she plans to leave the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation on June 7, and she will share more about her future charitable plans in the near future.\nThe organization will change its name to the Gates Foundation, and Bill Gates will become the sole chair, Suzman said.\n“I am sorry to see Melinda leave, but I am sure she will have a huge impact in her future philanthropic work,” wrote Bill Gates in a separate statement Monday, also posted on X.\n“Looking ahead, I remain fully committed to the Foundation’s work across all our strategies, and to realizing the opportunities we have to continue improving the lives of millions around the world,” he wrote.\nFrench Gates’ exit had been telegraphed for several years. Bill Gates and French Gates announced their divorce in May 2021. They said at the time they would allow themselves a kind of trial period through 2023 to determine if they could continue working with one another to oversee their massive charitable foundation.\nSuzman announced in July 2021 a contingency plan “to ensure the continuity of the foundation’s work.”\n“If after two years either decides they cannot continue to work together as co-chairs, French Gates will resign her position as co-chair and trustee,” Suzman said.\nGates will remain in control and, essentially, buy French Gates out of the foundation, Suzman said at the time. French Gates would receive “personal resources” from Gates for her own philanthropic work — resources that would be “completely separate from the foundation’s endowment.”\nIn January 2022, the foundation announced four new members to its board of trustees to help bolster the foundation’s governance in the wake of the divorce. It marked the first time the Gates foundation added outsiders to the charity’s board in its two-decade history. The charity had no trustees beside Bill and Melinda French Gates since Bill Gates Sr.’s death in 2020 and Warren Buffett’s resignation in June 2021 after 15 years on the board.\n“I want to reassure you that the millions of people our work serves and the thousands of partners we work alongside can continue to count on the foundation,” said Suzman in a post on the foundation’s website Monday afternoon. “The foundation today is stronger than it has ever been.”\n“I know we all wish Melinda the best in her next chapter,” he added, noting that French Gates “will not be bringing any of the foundation’s work with her when she leaves.”\nThe $75.2 billion Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s mission is to improve health care in developing countries, enhance educational opportunities and reduce poverty by providing grants and support to various initiatives and organizations around the world.\nFrench Gates also founded Pivotal Ventures, a separate charity that focuses on removing barriers for minorities and women in the United States, in 2015. She committed $1 billion to the organization in 2019.\nThe Microsoft cofounder and French Gates have both pledged to donate the vast majority of their wealth to the foundation as well as to other philanthropic endeavors.\nIn an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria in January, Gates said he and partners like Buffett have given away about $100 billion into the foundation. With plans to spend $9 billion a year, Gates anticipates he’ll have given away all of his money in about 20 years.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments and context.\nCNN’s Nicole Goodkind, Allison Morrow and Jenn Korn contributed to this report.\n",

        "content": "Ghost Shark and Manta Ray protect the undersea realm. Sounds like the plot of a future Marvel movie, but in actual fact, it’s what could be the future of Pacific naval defenses.\nGhost Shark and Manta Ray are the names of prototype uncrewed underwater vehicles – UUVs or drones – introduced recently by Australia and the United States respectively.\nExperts say the submersibles could represent the future of undersea warfare, showing the ability to exert power while minimizing the danger to human life.\nThe use of drones in aerial warfare has become commonplace. The US used them extensively during conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan beginning in the 1990s, and newer, cheaper drones have become key pieces of military hardware for both sides in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nKyiv has also built naval surface drones, which have inflicted heavy losses on the much larger and more expensive ships of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet.\nAerial and surface sea drones can be controlled using satellites and light and radio waves. But those don’t function in the same way in the depths.\nA 2023 study published in the Swiss journal Sensors points out that underwater communications require more energy but still see significant data loss to variables including water temperature, salinity and depth.\nMakers of the new generation of military UUVs aren’t saying how they would overcome communications problems.\nBut when Australia unveiled Ghost Shark last month, it called the prototypes “the most advanced undersea autonomous vehicles in the world.”\n“Ghost Shark will provide Navy with a stealthy, long-range autonomous undersea warfare capability that can conduct persistent intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR) and strike,” a statement from the Australian Defense Ministry said, adding that it expects the first production models to be delivered by the end of next year.\nAustralian officials and those from manufacturer Anduril Australia said they could not share any of the specs on Ghost Shark as those remain classified.\nBut they touted the speed with which the submersible has gone from idea to testing, with the program having started just two years ago.\n“Being ahead of schedule, on budget, it’s pretty unheard of,” Shane Arnott, Anduril’s senior vice president for engineering, told reporters.\n“Delivering the first Ghost Shark prototype ahead of schedule sets a new standard for capability development at the speed of need,” Australia’s chief defense scientist, Tanya Monro, said in a statement.\nEmma Salisbury, a fellow at the British think tank Council on Geostrategy, said the Ghost Shark seems much like the Orca extra-large UUV being developed in the US.\nRelated article\nA Ukrainian pilot outlines how drones powered by jet skis sunk a Russian warship\n“I assume that they are all intended for roughly similar mission sets – persistent intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and strike capability, particularly in the anti-submarine domain,” Salisbury said.\nThe US Navy called the Boeing-built Orca UUV “a cutting-edge, autonomous, unmanned diesel-electric submarine with a modular payload section to execute a variety of missions” in a December news release on the delivery of a first Orca test platform, an early prototype.\nHaving a modular payload means the Orca in theory could carry different weapons varieties depending upon the task or be fitted with specialized equipment for reconnaissance or possibly intelligence gathering.\nThe release said the Pentagon would acquire five more of the UUVs, without giving a timetable. But the US Orca has been in the works for more than a decade, the Navy release said, a sharp contrast to the speed with which Australia has developed Ghost Shark.\nChris Brose, Anduril’s chief strategy officer, said the company and Australia are in the “process of proving” that “these kinds of capabilities can be built much faster, much cheaper, much more intelligently.”\nAnduril Australia said the entirely domestically developed Ghost Shark would be made available for export after it joins the Australian naval fleet.\nMeanwhile, back across the Pacific, the Orca isn’t the only UUV being developed in the US.\nAmerica’s latest UUV entry is Northrop Grumman’s Manta Ray, a prototype of which was tested off Southern California in February and March.\nThe Defense Advanced Research Products Agency (DARPA), the Pentagon branch in charge of developing new technologies, says Manta Ray’s strength is in its modularity, the ability to switch out payloads depending on the mission.\nIt can be broken down and fit into five standard shipping containers, move to where it’s going to be deployed, and reassembled in the field, according to Northrop Grumman.\nThe prototype was built in Maryland and then reassembled on the California coast.\n“The combination of cross-country modular transportation, in-field assembly, and subsequent deployment demonstrates a first-of-kind capability for an extra-large UUV,” Kyle Woerner, who heads the Manta Ray program at DARPA, said in an agency news release.\nHe also noted the modular transport method means the Manta Ray can save internal energy for its mission, rather than using it to get to the deployment site.\nLike the Orca, the Manta Ray hasn’t come together as quickly as Ghost Shark. Its program began in 2020 and DARPA didn’t give a goal for the Manta Ray – or some variant of it – to join the US fleet.\nRelated article\nA Houthi missile was just seconds from hitting a US warship. The Navy used its ‘last line of defense’\n“DARPA is engaging with the U.S. Navy on the next steps for testing and transition of this technology,” the agency’s release said.\nMeanwhile, China, named by the US military as its “pacing threat” in the Pacific, is also making advances in UUVs, Salisbury said.\n“While details are scarce, as with most Chinese capabilities, they have been developing them for at least 15 years and likely now have something similar to the Orca (but with torpedoes) in the testing phase,” she said.\nSubmarine expert H I Sutton says on his Covert Shores website that, according to an analysis of open-source intelligence, Beijing is believed to have at least six extra-large UUVs under development.\nBesides Australia, the US and China, other countries working on UUVs include Canada, France, India, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Norway, Russia, South Korea, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, according to Sutton.\n",

        "content": "Chanu Gupta has lived in India’s financial capital Mumbai nearly his whole life, since arriving as a child from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.\nBut when polls open in the city, the 59-year-old street vendor won’t be able to vote in the nationwide election – along with millions of internal migrant workers who are a major backbone of the country’s economy.\n“I cannot go vote as I don’t belong to Maharashtra state,” Gupta told CNN in Mumbai’s shopping district Dadar, standing next to the roadside cart where he sells shaved ice and cold drinks. “I have voting rights in another state.”\nUnder India’s election rules, eligible voters can only cast ballots in their constituencies – meaning those working outside of their state have to return home to vote.\nThat’s all but impossible for many out-of-state workers, especially underprivileged daily-wage workers in the unorganized sector. And it’s a huge group – one study estimates there were about 600 million internal migrants in 2020, making up 43% of the country’s nearly 1.4 billion population at the time.\nThese workers are often from poorer rural parts of India, in search of work in bigger cities. Even then, they earn low wages that are usually sent home to support family members.\nPerhaps nowhere is this starker than Mumbai – India’s richest city and the birthplace of the Bollywood movie industry. Often referred to as the “city of dreams,” Mumbai draws migrants from across the country hoping to find wealth and success.\nMore than 43% of Mumbai’s population were classed as migrants in 2011 during the last national census, according to migration think tank Knomad. Many come from states with higher poverty and unemployment rates such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and Gujarat.\nSigns of that diverse mix are everywhere in Mumbai – the varied languages spoken, the many day laborers across the city, from auto-rickshaw drivers to construction workers and sugarcane juice vendors lining the streets.\nFor these workers, forgoing daily wages to head home to vote would come at a high cost – both in the money they would spend getting there, and lost wages. And those losses have a ripple effect on the family members back home dependent on their income – from children missing out on tuition fees to elderly parents’ rent and food costs.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic only underscored the volatility of migrant workers’ circumstances when millions lost their jobs almost overnight and were forced to go home.\n“Despite the living expenses being relatively high in large cities as compared to villages, their wages are considerably low causing poor living conditions including limited or non-existent public services such as water and sanitation,” said one United Nations-led study that examined the impact of the pandemic on this segment of the workforce.\nGupta said his shaved ice business relies on the hot summer months when the election takes place. “If I go to vote, I lose my business. Earning my living is more important to me than voting as I have to support my family,” he said.\n“There are many migrants like me who are in Mumbai to earn money and are not able to vote.”\nMany Indian citizens abroad – part of the massive global Indian diaspora – face the same problem, though their circumstances vary considerably.\nRelated article\nBillions spent, jungle-trekking poll workers and voting at 15,000 feet. What to know about the world’s biggest election\nMost are low-income laborers who helped build the economies and glittering cities of oil-rich Arab nations, while some are middle or upper-class students pursuing an international education or professional career in Western countries.\nAccording to government figures, there are 13.6 million such “non-resident Indians,” or NRIs, globally. The biggest group is in the United Arab Emirates, with 3.4 million NRIs, followed by 2.5 million in Saudi Arabia; next is the United States with 1.2 million.\nThe plight of NRIs in Gulf nations – many of whom live in cramped dormitories and labor camps – was also highlighted during the pandemic when businesses shut down, wages dried up and border restrictions prevented them from returning home, leaving them in limbo.\nFor these overseas Indians, there is no such thing as online voting or postal ballots. Instead, NRIs must register as an “overseas voter” then travel to their hometown in India to be physically present in their constituencies to vote.\nLocal media reports highlight some dedicated voters with the means to fly back and vote, such as professionals in the United Kingdom or Dubai. But they remain a tiny minority of NRIs who do so.\nAccording to the Election Commission of India, in the last national elections in 2019, more than 71,000 people registered as “overseas voters” – less than 1% of the total NRI population at the time.\nIndian authorities have pushed hard in recent years to increase turnout, urging all 968 million eligible voters nationwide to cast their ballots – a massive feat that includes setting up more than a million polling stations from remote forests to mountain peaks.\nThe ECI has also launched voter literacy initiatives and social media campaigns targeting young voters.\nThese efforts saw the highest voter turnout in the country’s history in the 2019 election, with more than 67% of Indians going to the polls.\nThe massive group of disenfranchised migrant workers stands in sharp contrast to these achievements – with no solution in sight.\nIn a 2011 study that surveyed workers across five Indian states, 60% of respondents had “missed voting in elections at least once because they were away from home seeking livelihood options.” It added that many migrants left home as young as age 13 to look for work – and did not have time to get their voter IDs when they became eligible at age 18.\nThe ECI acknowledged this problem in a 2022 report, raising the question of how to improve voter participation among internal migrants.\nOne issue the voting body highlighted was the absence of any clear definition of an internal migrant, adding that their inability to vote is a key reason “contributing to low voter turnout.”\nThe ECI said it had proposed remote voting machines to address the problem. But in 2023, the government said there were no such plans.\nThat means for now, voting remains an unlikely reality for many migrant workers.\n“I cannot say now whom I would vote for if I was in my hometown,” said Gupta, the Mumbai vendor. “That is the last thing on my mind – my focus right now is earning my livelihood.”\n",

        "content": "New analyses of the longest clinical trial yet of the weight-loss drug Wegovy are shedding light on how quickly it helps people lose weight, how long they sustain that weight loss and how safe the medicine is over four years of use.\nRelated article\nAt least 25,000 people in the US are starting weight-loss drug Wegovy each week, drugmaker says\nThe analyses – of a trial called Select, whose results showed last year that Wegovy significantly reduced heart risk in addition to helping with weight loss – also suggest that the drug may protect the heart in ways beyond weight loss alone, researchers said, raising new questions about how the wildly popular medicines in this drug class should be used – and covered by insurers.\n“The implications are profound,” said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist and scientist at Yale University and Yale New Haven Hospital who was not involved in the research, noting that a second study this week showed a similar finding for heart failure. “We have not encountered a drug with such a breadth of heart benefits.”\nMore than 25,000 people in the US are starting Wegovy every week, drugmaker Novo Nordisk said this month. And in a KFF poll released Friday, 6% of respondents said they were currently using a drug in this class, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists. That translates to more than 15 million Americans.\nOne important question about these blockbuster medicines is how widely – and how long – they’ve been studied. The Select trial, which was funded by Novo Nordisk, showed last year that Wegovy reduced the risk of a heart attack, stroke or heart-related death by 20% in people with existing cardiovascular risk with obesity or who are overweight. It included more than 17,600 people from 41 countries between 2018 and 2021 and followed them for several years.\nResearchers have continued to mine the data, and the new analyses, presented Monday at the European Congress on Obesity and published in the journal Nature Medicine, show results for people taking Wegovy as long as four years. Here are some major takeaways:\nThe analysis showed an average weight loss of just over 10% for people who used semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy, compared with 1.5% for study participants who got a placebo. The researchers, led by Dr. Donna Ryan of Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, noted that the trend showed that participants on the medication typically lost weight for about 65 weeks, or a year and three months, before reaching a plateau.\nA previous clinical trial showed even greater average weight loss for Wegovy: about 15% on average over 68 weeks, compared with 2.4% for people who got a placebo. The researchers on the new analysis noted that, in addition to some differences in the people who enrolled in each trial, the previous study was designed specifically for weight loss and included more structured lifestyle interventions about diet and exercise compared with the Select trial, which was designed to test whether the drug prevented cardiac events.\nThe results showed that the 10% average weight loss for people using Wegovy was sustained for up to 208 weeks, or four years.\nPatients stayed on the medicine while they sustained the weight loss. Other studies have shown that many people regain weight after stopping the drugs, including one published in December from Novo Nordisk competitor Eli Lilly: People using the GLP-1 drug Zepbound, which uses the active ingredient tirzepatide and targets a second hormone called GIP, lost an average of 21% of their body weight over 36 weeks. The participants were then split into two groups, and those who stayed on the medicine lost an additional 5.5% of their body weight, while those who unknowingly switched to a placebo regained 14% of their weight.\nHowever, not everybody regained so much weight. The study also looked at how many people maintained at least 80% of the weight loss after the initial 36 weeks, and while many more who continued on the drug did – almost 90% - almost 17% of people who were switched to a placebo maintained that much weight loss without the drug.\nIn the new analysis, the researchers reported that after two years, about 68% of people taking Wegovy had lost at least 5% of their body weight, while 21% of people on a placebo did. Almost 23% of people on Wegovy lost at least 15% of their body weight, compared with 1.7% on a placebo. And almost 5% of people on the drug lost more than 25% of their body weight, compared with 0.1% on placebo, showing that the top-line findings from studies are just averages; everyone has a different experience with medicines.\nOverall, more people on Wegovy decided to stop participating in the trial because of side effects than people who got a placebo: 17% of those on the drug versus 8% on placebo, a result that was previously reported. And the side effects were ones that are widely known with these medicines: mainly gastrointestinal disorders like nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and constipation, which usually affected people in the first few months of the study as the dose of the medicine increased.\nThe researchers noted that there were no new safety signals seen in the latest analyses. Acute pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas, wasn’t seen at a higher rate among those on Wegovy than placebo, although gallbladder disorders like gallstones were: 2.8% for people on Wegovy, compared with 2.3% for people on placebo. Both are included in warnings in the drug’s prescribing information because they’d been seen previously in trials.\nA key question when the full results of the Select trial were initially presented was whether the 20% reduction in heart risk was driven by weight-loss alone or some other protective effect of the drug. The new analysis suggests that there is something else at play.\nThat’s because the reduction in risk of heart attack or other events was seen even in people using Wegovy who didn’t lose weight.\nRelated article\nWeight-loss drug Wegovy offers benefits for people with diabetes and common form of heart failure, study finds\n“You probably don’t even need to lose weight to get the cardiovascular benefit” with semaglutide and similar medicines, said Dr. Daniel Drucker, a pioneer of research into GLP-1 at the University of Toronto who wasn’t involved in the new analyses. “That’s because that’s what GLP-1 does: It’s cardio-protective, at least in animals, independent of whether or not you have diabetes, independent of whether you have obesity, and you don’t require weight loss – it’s not the whole story.”\nAn analysis led by John Deanfield of University College London found that the reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in the study for those on Wegovy, compared with placebo, was similar among people who lost 5% or more of their body weight and those who lost less than that or even those who gained weight.\n“This suggests alternative mechanisms of improved cardiovascular outcome beyond reduction in adiposity,” or body fat, the researchers concluded.\nA separate study published Monday about heart failure, for which Wegovy has shown a major benefit, suggested the same thing, Krumholz said.\n“These two studies show that these anti-obesity medications are also heart-health drugs,” he wrote in an email. “The benefits to the heart for people with established cardiovascular disease or a certain type of heart failure occur regardless of the amount of weight loss.”\nDrucker suspects that GLP-1 drugs provide these kinds of benefits by reducing inflammation.\n“We can’t ignore the reduction in blood pressure or triglycerides, and the reduction in body weight must help a little bit, and glucose must help a little as well,” he said.\nBut based on his lab’s research, he said, “one of my favorite theories is inflammation, because we know that people with cardiovascular disease do have increased inflammation in their blood vessels and in the heart.”\nSign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\nDrucker said studies have shown that GLP-1 drugs tamp down harmful inflammation, which his lab is studying. He even noted that he receives communications from people with conditions like Covid-related brain fog, ulcerative colitis and arthritis – driven by inflammation – who think their symptoms have improved while using GLP-1 medicines. Those links would need to be borne out in clinical studies to be considered definitive.\nThe results in the Select trial, he said, raise the question of whether people who don’t have obesity or aren’t overweight but who have had a heart attack or stroke could benefit from taking a drug like Wegovy to prevent another event – another thing that would need to be studied.\nAnd, Drucker said, the results suggest that insurers should cover the medicines, which cost about $1,000 per month or more without it, more widely.\n“We probably really need to rethink these criteria for reimbursing the medicines, because they are not going to be helpful in terms of actually improving health and saving lives and saving health care dollars,” he said. “You don’t even need to lose weight to have a reduction in heart attack, strokes and death.”\n",

        "content": "Move over Met Gala. On Saturday, stars gathered on the steps of The Music Center in Los Angeles for the Gold Gala — a celebration of Asian Pacific influential talent across entertainment, fashion, technology and more, hosted by the non-profit Gold House.\nAnd they were dressed to represent — many proudly embracing Asian designers and cultural heritage through their red carpet looks.\nActor Karrueche Tran stunned in a striking red ao dai with a sheer overlay and headpiece by Vietnamese American fashion designer Thai Nguyen. “I knew I had to represent my culture, half of who I am, in a major way,” she wrote on Instagram. Tran has a Vietnamese mother and African American father.\nTaiwanese drag queen Nymphia Wind, who recently won “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” told CNN that her ensemble by Singaporean designer Sheng Cheong — a dress and cape featuring a bold print of neon yellow and white “laser cut clouds” — was intended to “reimagine what club kids would look like in the Forbidden City.”\nElsewhere, Bollywood filmmaker Karan Johar wore an ornately embroidered suit jacket by Rimple and Harpeet — an Indian fashion brand that specializes in handcrafted pieces inspired by ancient crafts and vintage textiles — and Indonesian singer Agnez Mo accessorized with golden hair pins and an elegant hand fan.\n“Anything goes here and that’s what is so celebratory,” TV personality Jeannie Mai told CNN of the event, which is sometimes described as the “Asian Pacific Met Gala.” “It’s the one place where you can really represent and be invited to do so.”\nThe glitzy affair honors the Gold House’s annual A100 list — one hundred Asian Pacific leaders who have made a significant impact on culture and society. Author and TV host Padma Lakshmi, actor Lucy Liu and the cast and creator of Netflix’s Emmy-award winning series “Beef” were among honorees.\nFor actor and comedian Joel Kim Booster, the significance of a gala feting so many people in the AAPI community, was not lost.\n“Events like this are so exciting to me because when I was coming up, I think there was a lot of energy like, there’s only going to be one of us in the room,” he said.\n“It’s so rewarding to be in a space like this where we’re all coming together and supporting each other. It’s not something that I grew up imagining I’d have for myself.”\nThere have been barriers across industries; in Hollywood, Asians have historically been underrepresented or stereotyped. But that has changed in recent years.\nA joint study by Gold House and the USC Annenberg found the percentage of speaking Asian characters in top box-office films in the US rose from 3.4% in 2007 to 15.9% in 2022. The roles themselves are more complex.\nThe age of streaming has also ushered in more opportunities for diverse and daring storytelling — on and off screen.\nFX’s Shogun, for example, became an instant hit when it premiered in February. Not only does it feature a predominantly Asian cast who speak mostly in Japanese — behind the scenes, Japanese experts in everything from samurai dramas to a “master of gesture,” were brought in to ensure authenticity.\n“I think what the industry has realized is that Asian creativity and Asian talent is a) different and b) lucrative. So that’s been wonderful to see people take chances, and how we’ve knocked it out of the park,” Lakshmi told CNN.\nMany acknowledge there’s more work to be done all around.\n“It’s an exciting time to see the Asian diaspora coming together to really tell our own stories, in our time, in our space,” said fashion designer and the gala’s creative director Prabal Gurung.\n“It’s great to see that visibility. There’s a long way to go still, obviously we feel that way. But progress is being made.”\n",

        "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\nScientists have accomplished a whale of a feat. They’ve identified previously unknown complexity in whale communication by analyzing thousands of recorded sequences of sperm whale clicks with artificial intelligence.\nVariations in tempo, rhythm and length of the whales’ click sequences, called codas, weave a rich acoustic tapestry. These variables hint that whales can combine click patterns in multiple ways, mixing and matching phrases to convey a broad range of information to one another.\nWhat sperm whales are saying with their clicks remains a mystery to human ears. Still, uncovering the scope of whales’ vocal exchanges is an important step toward linking whale calls to specific messages or social behaviors, the scientists reported May 7 in the journal Nature Communications.\n“This work builds on a lot of prior work focused on understanding the calls of sperm whales. However, this is the first work that has started to look at sperm whale calls in their wider communicative context and in the context of exchanges between whales, which has made some of the findings possible,” said study coauthor Dr. Daniela Rus, director of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT, in an email.\n“Understanding what aspects of their codas they can control and vary helps us understand how they can encode information in their calls,” Rus said.\nRelated article\nGreat apes tease each other just like humans do, says new study\nThe researchers dubbed their catalog of sound combinations a “phonetic alphabet” for sperm whales, comparing variations in the whales’ click sequences to the production of different phonetic sounds in human speech.\nBut while the team’s findings are interesting, that term offers a misleading perspective on whales’ vocal interactions, said Dr. Luke Rendell, a researcher at the University of St. Andrews in the United Kingdom whose work focuses on communication in marine mammals, in an email.\n“The presentation of the ‘phonetic alphabet’ — it’s nothing of the sort,” said Rendell, who was not involved in the research.\n“The way the tempo variation is used is completely different to how, say, we use elements of an alphabet to construct linguistic expression,” he said. “There’s no evidence of that, and it’s not a super helpful interpretation because it forces everything into a restricted and somewhat over-sold perspective of ‘is it like human language or not,’ when there are a much broader range of interpretations available.”\nSperm whales produce their clicks by forcing air through an organ in their heads called the spermaceti, and these sounds can be as loud as 230 decibels — louder than a rocket launch and capable of rupturing human eardrums — another team of scientists previously reported in the journal Scientific Reports.\nFor the new study, the researchers used machine learning to detect patterns in audio data collected by The Dominica Sperm Whale Project, a repository for observations of sperm whales that inhabit the Caribbean Sea. The recordings represented the voices of approximately 60 sperm whales — a subset of a group of about 400 whales known as the Eastern Caribbean clan — and the vocalizations were recorded between 2005 and 2018.\nPrior research had identified 150 types of codas in sperm whales worldwide, but the Caribbean whales used just 21 of those codas.\nThe scientists examined the timing and frequency of 8,719 coda sequences — in solitary whale utterances, in choruses and in call-and-response exchanges between whales. When visualized with artificial intelligence, previously unseen coda patterns emerged.\nRelated article\nThese snakes not only fake their own deaths, they use gory special effects to do it\nThe study authors defined four features in codas: rhythm, tempo, rubato and ornamentation. Rhythm describes the sequence of intervals between clicks. Tempo is the duration of the entire coda. Rubato refers to variations in duration across adjacent codas of the same rhythm and tempo. And ornamentation is an “extra click” added at the end of a coda in a group of shorter codas, Rus explained.\nThese so-called ornament clicks “occur more towards the beginning and end of turns” during vocal exchanges between whales, “behaving like discourse markers,” Rus said.\nThe discovery that whales could synchronize variations in coda tempo was “a really interesting observation,” Rendell said.\n“I am less convinced by the ‘ornamentation,’” he added. “It occurs very rarely, and I think we need more evidence that they aren’t just production glitches,” or filler sounds, “like when we say ‘um’ or ‘err.’”\nIn all, the program detected 18 types of rhythm, five types of tempo, three types of rubato and two types of ornamentation. These coda features could all be mixed and matched to form an “enormous repertoire” of phrases, the study authors reported. What’s more, meaning could be tweaked even further depending on the placement of a coda — following or overlapping other codas — within an exchange or chorus involving two or more whales.\n“Actually, many of us have been waiting for advanced technology to allow us to do something like this for decades!” said Dr. Brenda McCowan, a professor at the University of California Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, in an email.\nMcCowan, who was not involved in the research, was part of another team that, in 2021, conducted an interactive “conversation” with a humpback whale in waters near Alaska. For about 20 minutes, a curious whale repeatedly responded to a recording of a humpback song transmitted from the scientists’ boat.\n“This particular playback (with the humpback in 2021) was an opportunistic experiment with an inquisitive whale engaging us both behaviorally and vocally, and completely at her own volition,” McCowan said.\nRelated article\nA lone orca killed a great white in less than two minutes. Scientists say it could signal an ecological shift\nSuch interactive experimentation with whales, along with observations of whale behavior, could be an important part of unraveling the syntax of sperm whale click sequences, the authors wrote in the study.\nTheir machine learning method may also prove useful for studying other types of animal vocalizations, McCowan added.\n“Tempo, rhythm, rubato and ornamentation are likely to be found in other species of whales,” McCowan said. “We already know this is true of humpback song. But there is also evidence for this type of patterning in other aquatic, terrestrial and arboreal species to which this approach could be applied.”\nBut although this technique is helpful for identifying certain aspects of communication, it’s no Rosetta stone, Rendell cautioned.\n“Machine learning is great for finding patterns in large datasets,” he said, “but it doesn’t create meaning.”\nMindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine.\n",

        "content": "Michael Cohen implicated his former boss Donald Trump in the hush money scheme to pay Stormy Daniels just days before the 2016 election, saying he doled out $130,000 at Trump’s direction and was promised reimbursement.\nCohen’s testimony ties together the prosecution’s allegations that Trump broke the law by falsifying business records to reimburse Cohen and conceal the hush money payment that Cohen said he made at Trump’s direction. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies having an affair with Daniels.\nRelated live-story\nMichael Cohen testifies in Trump hush money trial\nCohen and Trump mostly avoided eye contact while he testified Monday. Cohen looked directly at prosecutor Susan Hoffinger throughout most of his testimony, occasionally scanning the room or looking in the jury’s direction. Trump spent long stretches of Cohen’s questioning with his eyes closed or thumbing through a stack of news stories.\nTrump’s attorneys are likely to get their chance to question Cohen on Tuesday. Trump attorney Todd Blanche is expected to try to shred Cohen’s credibility with the jury during cross-examination by painting him as a convicted perjurer who has changed his story more than once.\nHere are the takeaways from Day 16 of the Trump hush money trial:\nThrough roughly five hours of testimony Monday, Cohen walked jurors through how he worked with former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker on Trump’s behalf during the 2016 campaign to kill negative stories; how he kept Trump apprised of his hush money negotiations with Keith Davidson, the attorney for Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal; and how Trump approved and was aware of how Cohen would be falsely repaid in 2017 for the Daniels payment as legal services.\nCohen is the glue that brings together the other witnesses the jurors have heard from so far, connected through text message email and phone calls to Pecker, Davidson, Dylan Howard, Hope Hicks and others who were allegedly involved with the hush money payments.\nCohen described his conversations with Trump during the Daniels hush money negotiations, which prosecutors backed up using Cohen’s phone records to show when the two had spoken. He also connected the payment to Trump’s campaign.\n“I had to get this done,” Cohen said on the stand.  “This would be catastrophic to the campaign.”\nAfter Cohen and Davidson agreed to a $130,000 settlement payment on October 11, 2016, Cohen said he tried to drag out the process until after the election at Trump’s direction – claiming he would need 10 days to get the money together and noting that the office was closed on Yom Kippur.\nHoffinger asked why Cohen did that.\n“Because after the election, it wouldn’t matter,” Cohen said.\n“According to who?” Hoffinger asked.\n“Mr. Trump,” Cohen said.\nDaniels got fed up with the delays, leading to Davidson briefly canceling the settlement agreement, before they renewed the deal at the end of October.\nThe day before Cohen wired the money, he had two calls with Trump the morning in which he said he told Trump he was going to open the account for the LLC that would wire the money to Daniels.\n“I wanted to ensure that once again he approved what I was doing because I require approval from him on all of this,” Cohen said.\nHoffinger asked whether Cohen would have gone to the bank without Trump’s approval.\n“No,” Cohen said. “Everything required Mr. Trump’s sign-off; on top of that, I wanted the money back.”\nCohen described how he lied on his bank statements – lies that led to federal charges against him in 2018 – by saying that Essential Consultants LLC was being used for real estate consulting.\nWhen asked whether his bank would have opened the account had he been truthful, Cohen said, “I believe that they probably would not.”\nTrump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records – 11 invoices, 12 vouchers and 11 checks – records that prosecutors say stem from the monthly reimbursements Cohen received in 2017 for the hush money payment he made to Daniels.\nOn Monday, jurors heard through Cohen for the first time evidence directly connecting Trump to those reimbursements.\nCohen described how he was furious in December 2016 when his annual Christmas bonus had been cut by two-thirds.\nHe said he immediately went to Trump’s then-chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, “and in some colorful language expressed to him how truly pissed off and angry I really was. This makes no sense at all.”\n“I was even for myself unusually angry,” Cohen said. “I used quite a few expletives.”\nAfter the new year, Cohen said he went to Weisselberg about getting repaid for the $130,000 payment. “Let’s do it,” he said Weisselberg told him.\nThe jury was then shown Cohen’s First Republic bank statement, which showed the $130,000 settlement payment and Weisselberg’s handwriting detailing how Cohen should be repaid $420,000.\nRelated article\nRudy Guiliani’s radio show has been cancelled after he repeatedly discussed false 2020 election conspiracy theories\nCohen testified that he saw Weisselberg write on the document, while telling jurors that his money would be “grossed up” to account for taxes, because he was being paid in monthly installments as income, instead of as a reimbursement.\nImportantly, Cohen said that after their meeting, he and Weisselberg went to Trump’s office to speak to him about it. Cohen said he was given the title of personal attorney to the president around the same time but wasn’t going to be paid for that title.\nHoffinger asked whether he was being paid for future legal services.\n“That was what it was designed to be,” Cohen said.\n“What was it actually?” Hoffinger asked.\n“Reimbursement of my money,” Cohen said.\nCohen, who used to say he’d take a bullet for Trump in the height of their relationship, testified Monday about everything he did to protect his former boss.\nAs Cohen described each media story he killed and nondisclosure agreement he locked down ahead of the 2016 election, it was always in the name of protecting Trump.\nWhen it came to the settlement agreement with Daniels, Cohen said he kept control of a document revealing the identities of “David Dennison” and “Peggy Peterson” so that he could protect Trump.\nAnd he testified that he used the Essential Consultants LLC to facilitate the payment to Daniels “to protect him and to isolate him from the transaction.”\nHoffinger asked Cohen whether he would sometimes bully people. Cohen confirmed he would.\n“The only thing that was on my mind was to accomplish the task to make him happy,” Cohen said of Trump.\nCohen also testified that it’s “fair” to say he was once Trump’s “fixer” and told the jury he’d sometimes lie for Trump – including to his own wife.\nCohen said he opted to front the $130,000 to Daniels from his home equity line of credit on his personal property because his wife would’ve noticed the large sum missing from their joint personal bank account.\nCohen painted Trump – whom he often called “boss” – as a micromanager who insisted he be kept informed of the ongoings of any situation, including the more discreet instances like the nondisclosure agreements with McDougal and Daniels.\nCohen admitted he also kept Trump constantly informed because he wanted credit for handling Trump’s matters, whether it was negotiating invoices or suppressing negative media stories.\nCohen said he always wanted Trump to know situations were handled and he wanted “to get credit for accomplishing the task.”\nUnlike his typical public persona, the jury saw a subdued Cohen who gave slow and deliberate answers on direct examination.\nCohen rarely looked over at Trump sitting at the defense table, training his eyes mostly on the prosecutor questioning him.\nAnd aside from reviewing some documents and passing a few notes to his attorneys, Trump spent the majority of the day with his eyes closed. The former president glanced up at Cohen a few times, but there was never an obvious moment of eye contact.\nCohen did prompt a few headshakes of what looked like disapproval from Trump, including when Cohen mentioned Trump’s wife, Melania.\nCohen claimed Trump wasn’t worried about his wife’s feelings when the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape went public before the election – testimony contrary to what former Trump aides Hicks and Madeleine Westerhout told the jury.\nHe testified, “‘Don’t worry, he goes, ‘How long do you think I’ll be on the market for? Not long.’ He wasn’t thinking about Melania. This was all about the campaign.”\nAt one point, it seemed like Trump had heard enough of Cohen’s devoted-employee story, shaking his head with a pursed-lipped smile when Cohen testified that he used a shell company to pay Daniels to protect Trump.\nTrump shook his head with a sarcastic smile when Cohen admitted he was disappointed he wasn’t considered for chief of staff when Trump took office.\nThroughout the four weeks of the trial, Trump has looked to having supporters at court – both on the streets outside of the Manhattan courthouse and within the confines of Judge Juan Merchan’s courtroom – and has complained about not having more support.\nLast week, Trump’s son Eric Trump; his senior campaign adviser, Susie Wiles; and Sen. Rick Scott of Florida all appeared in the gallery behind the former president.\nOn Monday, Trump had his biggest entourage of GOP lawmakers yet – including potential vice presidential hopefuls.\nSens. J.D. Vance of Ohio and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama were in court, as was New York Rep. Nicole Malliotakis from Trump-friendly Staten Island, and the attorneys general of Alabama and Iowa.\nThey joined Trump for the high-profile Cohen testimony, sitting in the gallery behind the former president at the defendant’s table. Eric Trump and attorney Alina Habba were also there to support Trump.\nThe Republican politicians stood behind Trump while he gave his new conference before entering the courtroom Monday morning. And after the first break of the morning, they went outside to give their own account to the cameras to denounce the proceedings they had just witnessed.\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n",

        "content": "Nobody has anything nice to say about Michael Cohen.\nDonald Trump’s former fixer and lawyer is expected to take the stand Monday as the key witness in the Manhattan district attorney’s case against the former president, prepared to give testimony connecting to Trump the $130,000 hush money payment Cohen made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election.\nThrough three weeks of testimony, jurors have already heard plenty about Cohen through numerous witnesses, who have painted an unflattering portrait of an aggressive, impulsive and unlikeable attorney.\nDavid Pecker, former head of National Enquirer parent company American Media Inc., said Cohen was “prone to exaggeration.” Former Trump aide Hope Hicks said Cohen liked to call himself a “fixer” – a role she said was possible only because “he first broke it.” And Daniels’ former attorney Keith Davidson said he only worked with Cohen because he was a “jerk” whom Daniels’ then-manager Gina Rodriguez – along with everyone else – didn’t want to deal with.\n\n“Gina called me up to tell me that: ‘Some jerk called me and was very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me. And I, um, would like you, Keith, to call this jerk back,’” Davidson testified in the third week of the trial.\n“I hate to ask it this way, but who was that jerk?” asked Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass.\n“It was Michael Cohen,” Davidson responded.\nNow Cohen is the witness whom prosecutors are relying on to deliver testimony that can help them prove Trump falsified business records when he allegedly reimbursed Cohen for the $130,000 to Daniels to keep her from going public about a past encounter ahead of the 2016 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied the affair.\nCohen is the only witness who will testify about Trump’s alleged involvement in both the decision to pay Daniels and the plan to reimburse Cohen for advancing the money. Cohen will likely serve as the narrator for the prosecution and take the jury from the initial meeting in which Pecker, Cohen and Trump allegedly agreed to buy negative stories that could hurt Trump’s presidential run to the payment made to Daniels just days before Election Day to an Oval Office meeting in February 2017, just weeks after Trump was sworn in.\nProsecutors allege that during the February meeting, Trump and Cohen agreed how Cohen would be paid back. That arrangement, prosecutors say, included a false story that Cohen was working under a retainer agreement. The paperwork, from the invoices and general ledger entries to the checks signed by Trump, make up the 34 criminal charges in the case.\nProsecutors have waited to call Cohen until the end of their case, after introducing phone records, emails, text messages and bank records that they hope bolster his credibility with the jury. They have not tried to hide from the jury that he and other witnesses have plenty of problems.\n“We are going to be very up-front about the fact that several of the witnesses in this case have what you made might consider to be some baggage,” Steinglass told a panel of prospective jurors during jury selection.\nThe testimony will pit Trump against Cohen, who once said he would take a bullet for the former president. They last saw each other when Cohen testified in Trump’s New York civil fraud trial last fall. Cohen’s testimony was brief, but the showdown was tense.\nThis week the stakes are higher, with a potential criminal conviction and possible jail sentence on the line for Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.\nIt brings to a close a long journey for Cohen, who is still aggrieved that he served three years in prison and home confinement after pleading guilty to federal campaign finance charges related to the payoff, among other crimes.\nCohen met with prosecutors more than a dozen times and testified before the grand jury in the hush money trial. He has immunity on state charges for his role in the alleged conspiracy.\nHe will also face blistering cross-examination by Trump attorney Todd Blanche. The former president’s lawyers are expected to hammer at Cohen’s credibility, including digging into his past, and suggest to the jury that Trump had no idea what deal Cohen struck or how it was recorded on the books of his company.\n“Even before he takes the stand, Cohen has been attacked and undermined by the prosecution’s own witnesses. On one hand, he could be damaged goods before he takes the stand. But he also might benefit from low expectations if the jury finds him to be better than advertised,” said Elie Honig, a CNN senior legal analyst and former state and federal prosecutor.\nThe charges filed against Trump date to events that transpired during the 2016 election. But in many ways, the case against Trump stems from his former fixer’s decision to plead guilty in 2018 in federal court to two counts of making unlawful campaign contributions in violation of federal campaign finance laws. He implicated Trump directly in the scheme and admitted that he orchestrated to pay Daniels on Trump’s behalf.\nCohen also pleaded guilty to tax charges and to lying to Congress about Trump’s business venture to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison, which he served behind bars and under house arrest.\nCohen’s plea prompted the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office to launch the investigation surrounding the hush money payments that led to Trump’s indictment last year.\nCohen became dedicated to antagonizing Trump. He published two books, “Disloyal” in 2020 and “Revenge” in 2022, and launched a podcast, “Mea Culpa” – all of which spent plenty of time bashing Trump and cheering on his prosecution.\nOn social media, Cohen continued to attack Trump in the weeks leading up to the trial, and even after it began. The social media jabs reached the point that Judge Juan Merchan told prosecutors Friday to give Cohen a message “from the bench” that he should stop speaking about the case. (Merchan has said he cannot legally gag a witness.)\nTrump has often punched right back in interviews and on social media, including in several instances that violated the judge’s gag order on the former president barring discussion of witnesses in the case.\nBeginning with the first witness in the case, Pecker, jurors have heard criticisms from witness after witness of Cohen ahead of his own expected testimony.\nPecker, who met with Cohen and Trump at a key Trump Tower meeting in 2015, was asked by Trump attorney Emil Bove whether Cohen was “prone to exaggeration.”\n“Yes,” Pecker said.\nBove then asked Pecker whether he could not trust everything Cohen said. The judge sustained an objection to the question, telling Trump’s attorney in a sidebar discussion that it was not the right place to “impeach” Cohen’s credibility.\nMore witnesses would keep doing so anyway.\nCohen’s former banker, Gary Farro, then testified that he was specifically given Cohen’s account because he could be firm with individuals who “may be a little challenging.” Farro said it was fair to call Cohen an “aggressive guy.”\n“Anything he did need, he called me, and it was always something that was urgent,” the banker said.\nArguably the most negative assessment of Cohen came from Davidson, who negotiated the hush money deal with Cohen on Daniels’ behalf in 2016. Davidson described a 2011 conversation about a blog post on Daniels and Trump on thedirty.com, where Cohen unleashed a “barrage of insults and insinuations and allegations.”\n“I don’t think he was accusing us of anything. He was just screaming,” Davidson said.\nDaniels’ former attorney went on to explain how he ended up involved in the hush money deal, when Daniels’ manager asked him to help finalize the deal for a nondisclosure agreement.\nAsked why he got involved, Davidson said: “The moral of the story was: No one wanted to talk to Cohen.”\nDavidson recalled under questioning from Steinglass that after Trump was elected in 2016, he got a call in December from a “very despondent and saddened” Cohen.\n“He said something to the effect of: ‘Jesus Christ. Can you f**ing believe I’m not going to Washington? After everything I’ve done for that f**ing guy. I can’t believe I’m not going to Washington. I’ve saved that guy’s a** so many times, you don’t even know.’”\nOthers who didn’t interact with Cohen as much as Davidson didn’t have much better things to say. Jeff McConney, the former Trump Organization controller, was asked what Cohen’s position was at the company.\n“He said he was a lawyer,” McConney responded.\n“Did he work in the legal department?” asked prosecutor Matthew Colangelo.\n“I guess so,” McConney said derisively.\nAnd Hicks, who worked at the Trump Organization before becoming a key aide on the 2016 campaign, described to jurors how Cohen – Trump’s fixer – was prone to inflate his influence on the campaign.\n“There were times where Mr. Cohen did things that you felt were not helpful to what you were trying to accomplish, right?” Bove asked Trump’s 2016 campaign press secretary.\n“Yes,” Hicks responded. “I used to say that he liked to call himself ‘a fixer’ or ‘Mr. Fix It,’ and it was only because he first broke it that he was able to come and fix it.”\n",

        "content": "Editor’s Note: Norman Eisen is a CNN legal analyst and editor of “Trying Trump: A Guide to His First Election Interference Criminal Trial.” He served as counsel to the House Judiciary Committee for the first impeachment and trial of then-President Donald Trump. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.\nMichael Cohen, the erstwhile lawyer and fixer of former President Donald Trump, was one of the first witnesses I interviewed as part of the first Trump impeachment: That was because I was investigating the identical 2016 alleged election interference now at issue in the former president’s hush money criminal trial.\nThe hard-charging Cohen had been by Trump’s side since 2006, had negotiated the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels to benefit the Trump campaign and was about to report to prison after pleading guilty in 2018 to campaign finance violations for that payment and to other crimes.\nI expected someone very different from the person I met, who was candid, remorseful and funny, if profane and possessed of a hatred of Trump. Cohen has never wavered since in the key details he provided me about the election scheme and its cover-up that will also be at the center of his testimony in Trump’s Manhattan criminal trial starting Monday. As we approach his keenly anticipated appearance, I think he, like Daniels did last week, will exceed expectations in how he presents to the jury.\nThe District Attorney’s Office has set that up with their work throughout the trial. They have methodically bolstered Cohen’s upcoming testimony with a series of credible witnesses and corroborating documents, gradually narrowing the universe of uncorroborated evidence that Cohen will provide.\nCohen will undoubtedly be the subject of a vigorous cross-examination that will likely include the many lies he now admits having told when he was associated with Trump, as well as Cohen’s guilty plea for perjury. But the prosecution’s effective strategy has significantly shortened the leap of faith the jury will have to take to believe him (as I did when I interviewed him).\nHere is how the prosecution has supported Cohen’s testimony in advance across three major aspects of the case.\nTrump’s intent was to benefit his campaign\nFirst, Cohen is expected to testify, based on his conversations with Trump, that the purpose of the payment to Daniels and the later alleged business record falsification was to benefit Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. The prosecution has already presented extensive evidence of this to the jury. For example, the former chief executive of American Media and the publisher of the National Enquirer, David Pecker, testified that he met with Trump and Cohen at Trump Tower in Manhattan in 2015 to hatch the “catch and kill” conspiracy with the explicit purpose of benefiting Trump’s campaign.\nPecker explained that for the scheme to further benefit Trump’s campaign, he later set in motion the hush money payment to Stormy Daniels. So when Cohen testifies that he discussed the payment with Trump and that his purpose included benefiting the campaign, that just represents the carrying forward of an intent that has already been corroborated.\nCNN legal analyst Norm Eisen is in the courtroom for former President Donald Trump’s Manhattan criminal trial and chronicling what he sees for this CNN Opinion series. Read previous installments:• You can’t deny the skill of Trump’s defense lawyers• The Trump team swung for the fences. Thanks to Stormy Daniels, they struck out• What Trump may not have expected from Stormy Daniels’ testimony\nTo take another example, the jury also heard evidence of Trump’s own words suggesting that the purpose of the scheme was to benefit his campaign. Former Trump aide Hope Hicks testified that when the Daniels scandal emerged in 2018, the former president told her that it was better to be dealing with Daniels’ allegation of a sexual encounter with him at that time, because “it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election.”\nHicks further testified that Trump admitted to her that he knew Cohen had paid Daniels. Trump claimed Cohen made the payment on his own and not at Trump’s direction, but Hicks did not believe him. She explained it was implausible that Cohen would have paid Daniels absent Trump’s instruction.\nThe Trump Tower meetings: Formulating the scheme\nCohen will likely testify about a second meeting at Trump’s office that took place between October 10 and October 28, 2016, with former Trump Organization finance chief Allen Weisselberg in attendance, where Trump agreed to pay Daniels the $130,000. According to Cohen, Trump said “it is not a lot of money, and we should just do it, so go ahead and do it.” Trump then allegedly directed Cohen and Weisselberg to “figure this all out.” The two allegedly met again in early January in Trump Tower to do that, and then confirmed it with Trump.\nKeith Davidson, Daniels’ former attorney who negotiated her hush-money payment, made clear during his testimony that he believed Trump was responsible for final approval of the funds. He testified that he was under the belief that Cohen needed Trump’s approval to wire any funds and that Trump was the source. Davidson maintained that he never believed Cohen was the ultimate source of the funds, affirming the money was expected to come from Trump or an associated corporate body.\nFormer Trump Organization accountant Deborah Tarasoff also told the jury that Trump was directly involved in reimbursing Cohen. Tarasoff detailed how payments shifted from the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust to being personally made by Trump in 2017, reflecting a deeper personal engagement. She recounted processing checks for Trump’s signature, including one for $70,000 signed by Weisselberg and Eric Trump and a $35,000 check from Trump’s personal account.\nThis evidence was pivotal in challenging the defense’s assertion that Trump was detached from the transactions, clearly showing he actively repaid Cohen, including during his time in the White House.\nRelated article\nHere are all the bad things witnesses have said about Michael Cohen, Trump’s former fixer who is set to testify Monday\nThe White House meeting: Reimbursing Cohen\nCohen is also expected to testify that he met Trump in the White House in February 2017, and there Trump again agreed to the repayment plan that Weisselberg had concocted. Trump then proceeded to personally sign checks to Cohen from the Oval Office for the rest of the year. The DA’s office has already elicited testimony that corroborates this meeting and reimbursement scheme and highlights Trump’s frugality and check-signing practices.\nFor example, Trump Organization controller Jeffrey McConney was able to testify to Weisselberg’s handwritten note — “I’ve been looking at his handwriting for 35 years,” McConney said, confirming he recognized it — that spelled out the exact repayment scheme that Trump used to reimburse Cohen for the hush money. This key physical evidence from McConney and Weisselberg, who may not testify himself, independently establishes the “grossed up” amount that Trump then paid Cohen after their February 2017 meeting.\nMadeleine Westerhout, a former Trump aide who sat just outside the Oval Office and had direct line of sight to Trump’s desk, was able to testify both to scheduling Cohen’s physical presence at the White House for the February reimbursement meeting and to Trump’s business practices early in his administration. She spoke at length about how Trump continued to focus on personal and Trump Organization business minutiae while in the White House.\nThis supports the notion that Trump would have, in the same time period, paid close attention to the $35,000 checks he was signing for Cohen. Westerhout also read aloud her email confirming, to Cohen the February meeting at the White House.\nSign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook\nLastly, Sally Franklin, a senior vice president at book publisher Penguin Random House, quoted from Trump’s own books and own words about his check-signing and other practices that corroborate Cohen’s story over and over again.\nFor example, in “Trump: Think Like a Billionaire,” a chapter titled “How to Pinch Pennies” contained Trump saying, “I received a check for fifty cents, and we at The Trump Organization deposited it. They may call that cheap; I called it watching the bottom line… As I said before, I always sign my checks so I know where my money’s going. In the same spirit, I also always try to read my bills to make sure I’m not being overcharged.”\nTo be sure, the defense will come after Cohen on cross with his prior lies in service of Trump, his perjury conviction and more. But because Cohen is so strongly corroborated, believing him will not require a leap of faith for the jury — more like a short hop. When that is combined with the brutally unfiltered, heart-on-his-sleeve person I first met back in 2019, you get a witness who may surprise us all, and certainly the jury, by exceeding expectations.\n",

        "content": "The changing language used by the Ukrainian military in 72 hours of daily updates tells the story: “Ongoing defensive fighting.” “Significantly worsened.” Russian “tactical success.”\nYou rarely ever hear Kyiv’s top brass sounding downbeat, but their steep southerly trajectory reflects the grave place Ukraine finds itself in. Russia is not just advancing slowly in one place; it appears to be advancing in four, across the frontline.\nMoscow knows it is on the clock: in about a month, the $61billion of US military aid will start to translate into Ukraine having the weapons it has been begging for. So, Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to be throwing whatever he can at it, knowing the fight will likely only get tougher for his forces in the summer ahead.\nFirst, and most acutely troubling, is the northern border near Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city. Russian forces have crossed the border in multiple locations and claim to have seized nine villages. Their move 3 to 4.5 miles (5 to 7 kilometers) into Ukraine, in the border area above Ukraine’s second city of Kharkiv, is arguably their fastest advance since the first days of the war. Russia has thrown five battalions at the border town of Vovchansk, Ukrainian officials said, which has been hit hard by airstrikes over the weekend.\nThe town of Lyptsi is at risk, say some military bloggers, and from there Russian forces could hit Kharkiv with artillery. This is a nightmare for Kyiv for two reasons: firstly, they liberated this land from Russian forces 18 months ago, yet failed, clearly, to fortify the area enough to prevent Moscow sweeping back with the ease with which they were swept out.\nAnd secondly, Russia can again tie up Ukraine’s over-stretched army with constant and grinding pressure on Kharkiv, exacting a toll with crude shelling on a vast urban center.\nRelated article\nShifting his fishing buddy sideways in the Kremlin, Putin chooses an economy expert for the war in Ukraine. Here’s why\nThen there is the rest of the front, where progress in Kharkiv region has been mirrored by old, exhausting fights suddenly seeing new Russian success. This should be the greatest cause for concern to Kyiv, as it suggests a coordinated bid to push in all directions and leave Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky with ugly choices about where to send limited resources, and where ultimately to sacrifice.\nMoving slowly south from Kharkiv, closer to Bakhmut, the town of Chasiv Yar has been under intense pressure – a valuable height above two key Ukrainian military towns, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, which could prove an exhaustive pressure point over the summer on Kyiv’s supply lines. Netailove and Krasnohorivka slightly further south show Russian forces making further gains to the west of Avdiivka, and threatening another key hub – Pokrovsk. If Ukraine begins to fall back further here, its grip on the remnants of Donetsk region could be at risk.\nAnd then overnight, Deep State Map, a Ukrainian military analysis group, said the southern village of Verbove was under greater threat – one of the minimal gains from Kyiv’s stymied summer counteroffensive last year. All across the board, the news is bad: it is a growing calamity.\nUkraine’s rhetorical response has been telling. Its leaders have, for once, openly said how bad it is. They appear to be shuffling commanders around – which is not something you do in the heat of battle without desperate reason. There is vocal criticism of the failure to prepare and fortify the northern border regions over the past year. Indeed, along much of the front line where there is not active fighting, and in the near-rear to active frontlines, fortifications seem wanting, if not entirely absent. It may be that Kyiv believed so much in its counteroffensive last summer, that it failed to entertain the idea of bad news this summer.\nKyiv’s larger problem is global attention. Trenchant statements from European ministers, and even visits from senior Biden administration officials, cannot cut through the fatigue or the notion that helping Ukraine win is something governments see they strategically must do, rather than something their publics actively demand. It is becoming a war the world wishes would go away – side-lined by the horrors of the Middle East – exactly when its outcome is most perilous and vital for European security.\nRelated article\nPutin replaces Russia’s defense minister with a civilian as Ukraine war rages and defense spending spirals\nPutin used the weekend to reshuffle some of his cabinet – moving Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to a more procedural role as National Security Council head, and perhaps further away from the wartime cookie jar. An accountant, Andrey Belousov, will take his place. But this is not necessarily a sign of retribution for failure, or a reset: the same old boys still get nice jobs. It smacks more of Moscow economizing, integrating the war more fully into the economy, and settling in for the longer haul.\nThe opposite is happening in the West, where the congressional dysfunction pausing that paused the US’s $61 billion in aid has already wreaked havoc on Ukraine’s military effort. Its forces are losing now because of that six-month delay in ammunition reaching them. Europe talks big about making up the gap, but it cannot. And Washington DC will now be in a whirlwind of electioneering ahead of the US elections in November just when Kyiv needs American certainty most.\nThe news is not just bad, it is worsening daily. The ground on the front lines is drying out, bringing us into the season to attack. Russia has momentum unlike anything seen since March 2022. Ukraine is being forced to admit just how bad the situation is. Much of the world may be tiring of this war, but Putin is not.\n",

Unfortunately, some individuals who were unable to leave their homes fell victim to the floodwaters,” he said.\nAerial photos show belongings piled in plastic bags on rooftops, among them the hooded figures of women forced to cover their entire bodies even in times of disaster.\n“Women who were rescued are forced to wear mud-soaked garments, while even infants as young as 2 to 3 months old are clothed in similarly soiled attire,” Barakatullah said.\nIn Folo, more than 100 people are believed to have been killed, he said – mostly women and children.\nSome burials began over the weekend, but many more are already believed to be buried deep beneath mud.\nThe torrent swept away animals and farmland in an area already facing severe food shortages, according to Timothy Anderson, head of the WFP in Afghanistan.\nHe said the areas hit by floods had already been marked vulnerable to starvation after a difficult summer when searing heat brought drought.\n“It was already pretty grim. And now it’s catastrophic,” he told CNN.\nMost years, locals expect to see flash flooding, he said. But this year, it’s been far worse.\nThe loss of the homes and their land is devastating for survivors, who were already among some of the country’s most impoverished people, Anderson said.\n“When people lose a bit of livestock, that’s actually their livelihood,” he said.\nRoad access to the worst affected areas has been cut by floodwaters, forcing the WFP to use donkeys to send in supplies.\nWithin the first day, the WFP had distributed high energy biscuits and food for children. They’re also supporting local bakeries to supply free bread. In the next days, teams will start distributing food to feed families for a month – what happens next is unclear.\nAnderson said 17 joint assessment teams are being sent to the area, along with other UN partners. He said it’ll take four or five days for the teams to properly examine the impact of the floods on people, and their housing and infrastructure.\nThis latest natural disaster comes after drought in Afghanistan, and is being seen as an example of a climate crisis hitting those who have least contributed to rising global temperatures.\n“They’re not net emitters of carbon,” said Anderson of the WFP. “This is a subsistence agriculture community and society. So, they’re bearing the brunt of it, without having necessarily contributed to the issue very much.”\nHe said during the recent dry months, efforts had been made to help the community capture rainfall in dams and irrigation canals to sustain crops. Now those efforts have been washed away, posing another challenge.\n“The need is massive, not just in Afghanistan. The world is seeing the impacts of much larger, more severe events, whether that’s drought, rainfalls cyclones,” Anderson said.\nRichard Bennett, the UN’s special rapporteur on human rights in Afghanistan said the recent floods “are a stark reminder of Afghanistan’s vulnerability to the climate crisis.”\nAnd in a statement Sunday, Teresa Anderson, the Global Climate Justice Lead at ActionAid International, said: “The climate crisis continues to rear its ugly head.”\n“With the latest incident, Afghanistan joins a long list of Global South countries grappling with floods this year,” she said.\n",

Biden himself voiced that warning in his most explicit terms yet last week, telling CNN’s Erin Burnett that the US would withhold some additional arms shipments to Israel if they were to take such a step.\n“The president was clear that he would not supply certain offensive weapons for such an operation were to occur,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters at the White House Monday. “It has not yet occurred.”\nAs the war enters its eighth month, US officials are increasingly questioning Israel’s approach to the war, including publicly suggesting it is unlikely to achieve its stated aim of destroying Hamas and eliminating its leadership.\nOn Monday, Kurt Campbell, the State Department’s number two official, said there have plainly been tensions between the two countries on “what the theory of victory is.”\n“Sometimes when we listen closely to Israeli leaders, they talk about mostly the idea of some sort of sweeping victory on the battlefield, total victory. I don’t think we believe that that is likely or possible,” Campbell said, in a seeming allusion to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s repeated references to a “total victory.” “We view that there has to be more of a political solution. That’s one of the reasons why the president’s team has been so engaged with the surrounding region,” Campbell said at the NATO Youth Summit co-hosted by the Aspen Institute.\nGoing “headlong into Rafah” could have dire consequences, Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned on Sunday.\n“Israel’s on the trajectory, potentially, to inherit an insurgency with many armed Hamas left, or, if it leaves, a vacuum filled by chaos, filled by anarchy and probably refilled by Hamas,” Blinken said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\nAnd though the US believes Israel will be unable to completely destroy Hamas, the administration believes Israel has achieved many of its initial war aims. State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said last week that Hamas has been “significantly degraded.”\n“You have seen their ability to launch the kind of attacks that they did on October 7 significantly degraded, if not completely eliminated,” he said. “They couldn’t launch an attack of that scale today.”\n“Their weapons production factories underground have been eliminated. Most of their battalion leadership in the north and in central Gaza has been eliminated. So Israel has achieved a great number of its military objectives,” he continued.\nIt remains unclear whether senior Hamas leaders are present in Rafah, but the US is continuing to assist Israel in its mission of trying to eradicate as many senior members as possible, including by providing significant intelligence assistance in trying to track down figures including Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’s leader in Gaza.\nAs Biden continues to call for Israel and Hamas to reach a temporary ceasefire and hostage release agreement, in private, senior US officials have not gone as far as to urge Israel to consider a permanent end to the fighting, according to the senior administration official. However, the Biden administration has been ramping up the pressure on Israel to start focusing much more in earnest on post-war Gaza plans – so far, to little effect.\nIsrael’s lack of interest on the so-called “day after” plans has been a source of growing frustration for Biden advisers, according to one of the senior administration officials, who went as far as to describe Israel as displaying the attitude of believing that post-war Gaza is somebody else’s problem to figure out.\nIn public and in private, this official said, Israel has offered no clear views on two major questions: post-war governance and who would oversee the strip’s security whenever the war eventually comes to an end.\nBlinken publicly called on Israel to engage more seriously on developing a plan for post-war Gaza over the weekend. So far, the engagement has been sorely lacking, Blinken said.\n“We’ve been working for many, many weeks on developing critical plans for security, for governance, for rebuilding. We haven’t seen that come from Israel,” Blinken said on CBS. “We’ve been working with Arab countries and others on that plan. We need to see that too. We have the same objective as Israel. We want to make sure that Hamas cannot govern Gaza again.”\n",

The Bahamas has launched a naval blockade to keep Haitians from fleeing the crisis by boat; the UK has sent a warship to ward off anyone seeking refuge in Turks and Caicos, a British overseas territory; and the US state of Florida has increased marine and aviation patrols.\nAnd yet guns, bullets and drugs keep pouring in, crossing international waters and airspace to reach the embattled country – most of the firepower originating from the US.\n“Haiti doesn’t produce guns and ammunition, yet the gang members don’t seem to have any trouble accessing those things,” says Pierre Esperance, executive director of Haiti’s National Human Rights Defense Network.\nSince the start of the year, thousands of people have been killed in gang-related violence and hundreds kidnapped, including at least 21 children, UN figures show. Stopping the flow of guns to Haiti would likely have an immediate impact on the bloodshed, according to police and human rights experts.\n“We have to cut the gangs’ weapons supply lines. This is absolutely the most important thing now,” the police source told CNN. “Because when they don’t have bullets, their machine guns become nothing more than clubs.”\nAnd as a Kenyan-led multinational security support force (MSS) prepares to deploy to Haiti, starving the gangs of ammunition should be a top priority for the US, says William O’Neill, the UN Designated Expert of the High Commissioner on the situation of Human Rights in Haiti.\n“All of these countries that are contributing their young men and women (to the MSS), how can we make it safer for them to do their job? One way the US could help immediately and directly would be to really seriously crack down on the flow of illegal weapons,” he said.\n“The gangs have literally nothing else; their only currency is intimidation and fear.”\nEighteen months ago, the UN Security Council imposed an arms embargo on Haiti, which bans the export of weapons to anyone in the country other than the government. The US has also taken independent steps to crack down on illicit exports, appointing a regional coordinator for firearms prosecution in the Caribbean and a special unit to investigate transnational crimes in Haiti.\nYet the guns keep coming. In January, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) warned that Haiti-bound firearms and ammunition were being “routinely incorporated into outbound shipments at warehouses near seaports and airports” in Florida, citing interviews with US customs officials.\nRelated article\nGangs forced out Haiti’s government. This FBI ‘Most Wanted’ gang leader claims they’re liberating the country\nThe following month, Haiti’s gangs put their weapons to devastating use, taking the country hostage in an explosion of coordinated violence that forced then-Prime Minister Ariel Henry to resign, and led to the creation of a transitional governing council that has so far been mired in disagreement.\n“The planes have not stopped flying. There continue to be exchanges of both ammunition and arms across the border,” Sylvie Bertrand, the UNODC regional representative, told CNN recently, urging the global community to enforce the arms embargo.\nBut amid today’s chaos, experts say it is likely becoming easier than ever for the gangs to resupply, as they now control major routes and infrastructure to bypass official controls.\n“There are always weapons coming in. There are always bullets,” Vitel’homme Innocent, leader of the Kraze Baryé gang, told CNN in April, his masked entourage bristling with a globally manufactured assortment of firepower.\nWeapons experts who later analyzed some of CNN’s images from the encounter said they could spot weapons and accessory parts originating from Israel, Turkey, the Czech Republic, probably Brazil – and, overwhelmingly, from the United States.\nThe guns Haiti’s gangs wield are a mix of stolen and smuggled, and the United States is by far the main source of the latter, according to UN experts.\nFrom 2020 to 2022, over 80% of the weapons seized in Haiti and submitted to US authorities for tracing were manufactured in or imported from the United States, UNODC reported in January, citing the most-recent available tracing data.  They are typically purchased in the US from federally licensed retail outlets, gun shows or pawn shops through “straw man” intermediaries, the agency also found.\nIt’s all part of a phenomenon that experts in Latin America and the Caribbean call the “iron river” – a flood of guns bought in US states with lax gun laws, and then shipped across the region to criminal groups. The Mexican government, which has been outspoken about the issue, currently has a $10 billion lawsuit pending against several US gun manufacturers whose products, it says, arm powerful cartels.\nA senior agent at the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), which investigates the diversion of lawfully purchased guns to illegal ends, told CNN that Miami is a significant source of weapons sent to Haiti, which have historically been trafficked in small freighters by family networks.\n“Those are difficult to enforce because they’re not your typical commercial freighter… it’s relatively easy to conceal a small number of firearms in those shipments,” he said. Texas, Louisiana, and Georgia are also sources of weapons trafficked to the Caribbean, where the ATF has a specialized gun intelligence unit to track and stop such flows, he added.\nAsked whether the US was doing enough, he emphasized that combatting gun trafficking was a top priority. “It is a very high priority of the United States government and ATF’s role in that, to stem the flow of illegal firearms, whether domestic or international, and particularly places like Haiti where the rule of law is under extreme threat.”\nIn January, Joly Germine – leader of the gang 400 Mawozo – pleaded guilty to US charges over a gunrunning scheme that saw dozens of rifles, handguns and a shotgun purchased legally in Florida under false pretenses, and smuggled into Haiti.\nFrom above, traces of Haiti’s extensive smuggling networks come into focus: the scars of a clandestine airstrip in its sun-bleached Central Plateau, a dock jutting from gang-held territory into the still waters of the Gulf of Gonave.\nSea and air are the main means of transport for the guns and the drugs trans-shipments that fund more weapons purchases, experts say. And while Haitian authorities have seen some successes in seizing illicit cargo over the years, the dramatic peaks and plains of this “land of mountains” add difficulty for an already understaffed police force and customs agency.\nHaiti’s secluded and sparsely populated rural areas are ideal for landings and take-offs by small planes aiming to avoid observation. There are at least 11 known informal or clandestine airstrips in the country, according to UNODC, many originally built for humanitarian purposes following the country’s devastating 2010 earthquake.\n“Here, you don’t have anything around you. So, you just go, probably in the middle of the night, with a couple vehicles parked on each side of the improvised runway so the pilot can identify the area. They land, drop off or pick up stuff, and take off again all outside of Haitian jurisdiction,” a security expert in Port-au-Prince told CNN.\nThe sea is the preferred option for arms smugglers given the weight of their cargo. Haiti’s roughly horseshoe shape offers over 1,100 miles of coastline, a challenging distance to comprehensively patrol for Haiti’s coast guard.\nHaiti’s south in particular has emerged as a strategic location for smugglers, the UNODC reported in April, offering entry points for cocaine from South America, cannabis from Jamaica and firearms from across the region.\n“One popular method of moving illegal products involves “banana boats,” go-fast vessels that arrive at night, beach on coastal banana plantations, and are subsequently destroyed after unloading their cargo,” the UNODC report details.\nGuns and ammunition that arrive in the south are frequently sent onward to Port-au-Prince via the gang-controlled Route National 3, it also said, identifying the Mariani gang, Grand Ravine gang, and 5 Segond gang as “major players in the organization and distribution of arms, munitions and drugs.”\nIn 2022, 5 Segond group attacked Haiti’s largest flour mill. It would have been an incongruous target if not for its location, positioned right next to Port-au-Prince Bay with a large jetty to accept deliveries. Just about a mile inland lies a major highway, and in between the two is a massive warehouse; a perfect distribution set-up for any import entrepreneur.\nToday, the entire area is controlled by 5 Segond, with security sources telling CNN that they believe the mill has been taken over and no longer functions.\n“Izo has the jetty, so he has access to the sea. And boats keep coming in and out of that area, which again is completely controlled by his gang… and is kept under tight control, with barricades in the surroundings,” the same security expert said, referring to 5 Segond’s rapper frontman Andre Johnson, who often posts videos of gang members flashing guns and paramilitary gear set to music on social media.\nContraband arriving via secretive small boats and planes is just part of the picture. Last month, Haitian National Police and Customs agents seized more than two dozen firearms, including 12 assault rifles, and nearly a thousand cartridges from a shipping container that had arrived in Haiti’s northern city of Cap Haitien.\nDrugs and arms smuggling has a long history in Haiti, much of it facilitated through official channels by government agents and even, in one 2022 case, by a rogue Episcopal church staffer who allegedly hid guns and thousands of rounds in a shipping container reportedly labeled as church donations, before it was seized by customs agents in Port-au-Prince.\nCustoms officials trying to do their job on the front lines in Haiti can face threats to their lives. In 2018, local press reported that several customs agents at the Malpasse border crossing between the Dominican Republic and Haiti were burned alive after an argument erupted in the course of a cargo inspection.\nAllegations of smuggling and gang affiliations have also been made at the highest levels of Haiti’s government. Four former Haitian senators have been sanctioned by the US for alleged drug trafficking, as have multiple past presidents and prime ministers of Haiti for allegedly financing the country’s gangs. They’re part of what gang leader Innocent refers to as the country’s “oligarchs,” who historically created and armed local gangs to become their enforcers-for-hire as they profited from white-collar crime schemes.\n“As a Haitian human rights defender, I can’t say that all the responsibility for these guns is on the US – I think it’s the Haitian government too. They need to regain control of the port, they need to control customs. The problem is corruption,” says Esperance, the human rights advocate.\nRelated article\nHunger in Haiti is spreading amid gang violence, aid workers warn\nThat’s why, he says, the planned deployment of an international police force to restore calm to Haiti is destined to fail unless the US and global community also commit to fighting corruption, building frameworks for good governance, and closing legal loopholes abused by the country’s elite.\n“Now, of course, the government is completely destabilized, it’s easy for the gangs to smuggle weapons themselves. But how did they begin? Just two years ago, smuggling was going through official channels, and it happened that way because everyone was corrupt,” Esperance said.\nBertrand, the UNODC representative, also emphasized the importance of building up Haiti’s institutions as its new government takes shape. Her agency is working to strengthen the country’s customs authority and coast guard, for example, including providing much-needed equipment from protective gear to cargo scanners.\n“It’s time for people in Haiti to live peacefully – for their kids to go back to school, for them to be able to eat every day.” And that means, she says, ensuring that “national authorities are well-trained, well-equipped, and ready to face and curb down the level of violence.”\nCNN reached out to Homeland Security Investigations, part of the US Department of Homeland Security; the US Department of Commerce’s Office of Export Enforcement, Haiti’s National Police and Haiti’s General Customs Administration for comment.\n",

        "content": "Acclaimed Iranian filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof says he has fled his home country to an undisclosed location in Europe after a court in Iran sentenced him to prison on national security charges.\nRasoulof condemned the Iranian government in an Instagram post on Monday, calling it a tyrannical and oppressive regime, and posting a video that showed him crossing the country’s mountainous border.\n“If geographical Iran suffers beneath the boots of your religious tyranny, cultural Iran is alive in the common minds of millions of Iranians who were forced to leave Iran due to your brutality and no power can impose its will on it. From today, I am a resident of cultural Iran,” he said.\nIn a separate statement dated May 12, Rasoulof said he had decided to escape Iran after his lawyers told him his prison sentence would be implemented on short notice.\n“I had to choose between prison and leaving Iran. With a heavy heart, I chose exile,” he said in that statement, which was provided by a spokesperson.\nCNN has reached out to Iranian authorities for comment. His lawyer Babak Paknia said last week that an Iranian court had sentenced Rasoulof to eight years in prison and flogging after it found his films and documentaries to be “examples of collusion with the intention of committing a crime against the security of the country.”\nRasoulof is among several high-profile artists to have been caught up in a widening crackdown on dissent by Iranian authorities since nationwide protests broke out over the 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini, who was arrested for allegedly not wearing her headscarf properly.\nRasoulof, whose recent films have been critical of the Iranian government, was among a group of artists and filmmakers who signed a letter criticizing the violent response of security forces to quell a 2022 protest over a building collapse in the southwestern city of Abadan that killed more than 40 people.\nRasoulof won a Golden Bear for best film at the Berlinale festival in 2020 for “There Is No Evil” and his film “A Man of Integrity” was recognized for a “Certain Regard” honor at the Cannes Film Festival in France in 2017.\nRelated article\nIran sentences renowned director to 8 years in prison and flogging, lawyer says\nThe filmmaker’s latest work, “The Seed of the Sacred Fig,” is set to premiere at Cannes next week, but it’s unclear if he will be able to attend.\n“We are very happy and much relieved that Mohammad has safely arrived in Europe after a dangerous journey,” said Jean-Christophe Simon, the distributor for Rasoulof’s latest film.\nThe Films Boutique and Parallel45 executive added that he hopes that Rasoulof will be able to attend the Cannes premiere for his film “in spite of all attempts to prevent him from being there in person.”\nRasoulof said on Instagram that he will now work to quickly finish the last technical steps of his film’s post-production.\n“Many people helped to make this film. My thoughts are with all of them, and I fear for their safety and well-being,” he said, accusing the Iranian government of pressuring members of his production team with interrogations, court filings and travel restrictions.\nRasoulof didn’t specify how he escaped Iran, saying only that he did it secretly with the help of friends and acquaintances.\nIn 2022, an Iranian court sentenced Rasoulof to one year in prison and banned him from making films for two years on the charge of “propaganda against the system,” according to Human Rights Watch. Iranian authorities have previously arrested him multiple times and confiscated his passport because of his work, HRW said.\nAdditional reporting by Michael Rios\n",

        "content": "A Chinese citizen journalist who has been behind bars for four years over her reporting on the initial Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan is due to be released Monday after serving her sentence, according to supporters and a court verdict.\nZhang Zhan, a former lawyer, was one of the few independent Chinese journalists reporting in Wuhan after the metropolis of 11 million people went into a complete lockdown, offering a rare, unfiltered glimpse into the reality on the ground as Chinese authorities imposed tight censorship on media coverage.\nShe was detained in May 2020 and sentenced months later to four years in prison for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” – a charge commonly used by the Chinese government to target dissidents and human rights activists.\nZhang is due to finish her sentence on Monday, according to the court verdict on her case obtained and published by human rights groups.\nSupporters and rights groups have called on the Chinese government to free Zhang on schedule.\n“So far I have not received any confirmation that Zhang Zhan has left the prison and is home with her family. We are all still waiting,” said Jane Wang, a UK-based advocate for the Free Zhang Zhan campaign.\n“I understand that her parents and brother have been under enormous pressure and warned severely not to give media interviews. Friends’ calls are also left without answers… these are extremely worrying signs,” she added.\nReporters Without Borders (RSF), which awarded Zhang its Press Freedom Award in 2021, called on “the international community to put pressure on the authorities to ensure her unconditional release on Monday,” in a post on social platform X Friday.\nRelated article\nThis Chinese virologist shared crucial Covid-19 data. Then his research hit hurdles\nIn early February 2020, just days after Wuhan went into lockdown, Zhang traveled some 400 miles from Shanghai to the central Chinese city to report on the spread of the virus and subsequent attempts to contain it, just as authorities tightened censorship on state-run and private Chinese media.\nFor more than three months, she documented snippets of life under lockdown in Wuhan and the harsh reality faced by its residents, from overflowing hospitals to empty shops, as the world braced for the spread of the virus. She posted her observations, photos and videos on WeChat, Twitter and YouTube – the latter two of which are blocked in China.\n“I can’t find anything to say because everything is covered up. This is the problem this country is facing now: any opposing opinions from us might be (dismissed as) ‘rumors,’” she said in a video two weeks after arriving in Wuhan, donning a face mask.\n“Even our own voices are out of our control. They imprison us in the name of pandemic prevention and restrict our freedom…If we cannot obtain the truth, if we cannot break their monopoly of the truth, the world will be meaningless to us.”\nHer posts came to an abrupt stop in mid-May, and she was later revealed to have been detained by police and brought back to Shanghai.\nChina’s Foreign Ministry declined to confirm whether Zhang had been released from prison at a regular news conference on Monday afternoon.\n“I don’t know the relevant information, but what I can tell you is that China is a country governed by the rule of law. Anyone who violates the law should be punished by law,” said ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin.\n“At the same time, China fully protects the legal rights of defendants and prisoners in accordance with the law,” he added.\nHuman rights advocates who have long worked on China say Zhang is likely to live under close surveillance from authorities even if she does walk out of prison.\n“While Zhang is released from prison, it won’t mean she will be free,” said Yaqiu Wang, research director for China at advocacy group Freedom House.\n“If the Chinese government’s past record is of any indication, she will face continued harassment and surveillance by authorities. But if Zhang Zhan’s past actions are any indication, she will keep fighting against efforts to silence her.”\nSarah Brooks, Amnesty International’s China director, said she was concerned that Zhang’s ability to travel or to make contact with relatives and others, especially those outside China, may be severely restricted.\n“Zhang Zhan should never have been jailed in the first place; now, having served her time, our hopes are with her and her family for a safe reunion and road back to health and, if she chooses, her important human rights work,” she said.\n“The Chinese government’s jailing of Zhang Zhan has been a shameful assault on her human rights, and her release must mark a new beginning.”\nSupporters and rights groups are also concerned about Zhang’s access to medical treatment upon her release, given her poor health conditions while in prison.\nThe 40-year-old has been on multiple hunger strikes since being detained and was briefly hospitalized. In 2021, Zhang’s mother said her daughter was so frail that she could not hold her head up for lack of strength and was in desperate need of medical care.\nDuring a previous hunger strike, Amnesty International alleged Zhang was shackled and force fed, treatment the group said amounted to torture.\nChina’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not previously respond to CNN on allegations of Zhang’s mistreatment in detention.\nIn a lengthy statement issued in July 2020, the Foreign Ministry denied the Chinese government had cracked down on journalists who “exercised their right to freedom of speech on the Internet” during the pandemic.\n“In China, no one gets punished or penalized simply because of making remarks,” the statement said. “The Chinese government has all along conducted its Covid-19 response in an open and transparent manner, and has made widely recognized achievements.”\nZhang was one of a number of independent reporters who were detained or disappeared during the outset of the pandemic, as Chinese authorities clamped down on coverage of the virus and propaganda outlets went into overdrive portraying Beijing’s response as effective and timely.\nChina is the biggest jailer of journalists in the world, according to Reporters Without Borders, which ranks it at 172 out of 180 countries around the world in its annual Press Freedom Index.\nAuthorities tightly control the press at home while blocking most foreign media outlets via the Great Firewall, its vast online censorship and surveillance apparatus.\n",

        "content": "Georgia’s parliament is set to pass a highly controversial so-called “foreign agents” bill that has triggered widespread protests across the former Soviet republic nestled in the Caucasus Mountains.\nTens of thousands of people in capital city Tbilisi have been protesting the legislation. Critics warn that it mirrors a foreign agents law already passed in Russia and could jeopardize Georgia’s bid to join the European Union.\nBut Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze has said the government is not planning any “substantial changes” to the bill, and has vowed to get it passed on Tuesday, when lawmakers in the former Soviet country are expected to vote.\nHere’s what you need to know about the proposed law and the uproar it has caused.\nThe bill would require organizations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as “agents of foreign influence” or face crippling fines.\nThe legislation was drafted by the Georgian Dream party, which along with its allies controls parliament. The proposal will receive a vote on Tuesday and it is expected to pass.\nGeorgia President Salome Zourabichvili called the bill “an exact duplicate” of its Russian counterpart in an interview with CNN.\nShe has vowed to veto the bill, but that won’t mean much. Georgia’s government is a parliamentary system, so Zourabichvili is effectively a figurehead. Real power lies with Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze. Georgian Dream’s billionaire founder, former Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, also wields significant political influence.\nA couple of reasons.\nThe proposed law is modeled after a similar one in Russia that the Kremlin has used to increasingly snuff out opposition and civil society. Many Georgians fear their foreign agents bill will be used to the same way it has been in its northern neighbor: to quash dissent and free expression by going after nongovernmental organizations with financial ties overseas.\nGeorgian Dream contends the legislation will promote transparency and national sovereignty and has hit back at Western criticism over the proposal.\nBut the law’s possible passage has touched on a more existential question: whether Georgia’s future lies with Europe or Russia.\nGeorgia has, like Ukraine, been caught between the two geopolitical forces since achieving independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.\nMany Georgians feel deep hostility toward the Kremlin, which invaded Georgia in 2008 and occupies about 20% of its internationally recognized territory – about the same proportion that Russia occupies in Ukraine.\nGeorgian Dream has long been accused of harboring pro-Russian sympathies, especially given that Ivanishvili made his fortune in the Soviet Union.\nPassionately. So much so that lawmakers at one point came to blows over the bill.\nPolling shows that about 80% of Georgians support joining the European Union rather than drifting further into the Kremlin’s orbit, and many of those in favor of deepening ties with the West have taken to the streets.\nCNN's Anna Coren speaks to Giorgi Revishvili about Georgia's foreign agents bill, known to critics as the so called \"Russian law.\"\nRelated video\nExplaining the controversy surrounding Georgia’s foreign agents bill\nMass demonstrations against the bill in Tbilisi have been going on nightly for a month. About 50,000 people came out Sunday evening in the capital, which is home to about 1 million people, to speak out against what they’ve dubbed “the Russian law.”\nThere have been counter-protests as well. One saw the reclusive Ivanishvili deliver a rare speech to a crowd of supporters bussed in to Tbilisi from Georgia’s rural regions, where Georgian Dream enjoys more support.\nThe address showed deep paranoia and an autocratic streak. Ivanishvili claimed that Georgia was being controlled by “a pseudo-elite nurtured by a foreign country” and pledged to go after his political opponents after October’s elections.\nYes, just last year.\nGeorgia’s government tried to pass the same law but was forced into an embarrassing climbdown after a week of intense protests, which saw citizens waving EU flags buffeted back by water cannons.\nThe bill was reintroduced in March, about a month after Kobakhidze became Prime Minister. This time, authorities seem determined to push the legislation through.\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan wrote on X that Washington is “deeply alarmed about democratic backsliding in Georgia.”\n“Georgian parliamentarians face a critical choice – whether to support the Georgian people’s Euro-Atlantic aspirations or pass a Kremlin-style foreign agents’ law that runs counter to democratic values,” he said. “We stand with the Georgian people.”\nThe Kremlin has claimed that the law was being used to “provoke anti-Russian sentiments,” adding that protests against it were being stirred by “outside” influences.\n“This is now the normal practice of a huge number of states that are doing everything to protect themselves from outside influence, from foreign influence on domestic politics. And all countries are taking action in one form or another, but all these bills have the same goal,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in April. “Once again, there is no way to link this bill and the desire to secure Georgia’s internal politics with some kind of Russian influence; this is not the case.”\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement earlier this month that she was following the developments in George with “great concern” and reiterated Brussels’ unease over the law.\n“Georgia is at a crossroads. It should stay the course on the road to Europe,” she said.\nDefinitely.\nGeorgia first applied for EU membership in 2022 and was granted candidate status in December, an important but still early step in the process of becoming a member of the bloc. However, Brussels said last month that the law’s passage would “negatively impact” Georgia’s path to EU membership\n“Georgia has a vibrant civil society that contributes to the country’s successful progress towards EU membership. The proposed legislation would limit the capacity of civil society and media organizations to operate freely, could limit freedom of expression and unfairly stigmatize organizations that deliver benefits to the citizens of Georgia,” EU officials said.\n“The EU urges Georgia to refrain from adopting legislation that can compromise Georgia’s EU path, a path supported by the overwhelming majority of Georgian citizens.”\nCNN’s Anna Chernova contributed to this report.\n",

        "content": "Xi Jinping may have started his recent European trip by fielding tough questions in France about trade and Russia’s war in Ukraine, but the Chinese leader ended the sojourn late last week by projecting a stark message: that despite frictions with much of the continent, China still has fans in some European capitals.\nBeijing’s pulling power was on show in Belgrade and Budapest, where streets were festooned with Chinese flags. As Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan touched down at both cities’ airports, folk dancers performed on the tarmac and, in contrast to the subdued welcome the couple received in Paris, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban were on hand to greet them.\nChinese state media played up the warm diplomacy, with headlines proclaiming China’s “ironclad” bond with Serbia and “golden friendship” with Hungary. Both countries, major recipients of Chinese investment, announced upgrades of their relations with China during the visits – a symbolic win for Xi that analysts say could play a role softening European policy on China in fraught areas such as trade, security and human rights.\nBut in the rest of Europe, the red-carpet welcome afforded Xi by Vucic and Orban – both widely seen as illiberal and Russia-friendly – may not play as well, analysts say, and emphasizes the shrinking number of European capitals where Xi would meet such a warm embrace.\nChina-Europe relations have been frayed by the European Union’s growing list of economic grievances with China, which could yet spiral into a full-blown trade war. Also in the mix are suspicions across Europe about Beijing’s global ambitions and influence, especially over its support for Russia – including allegations it is supplying dual-use parts which help the Kremlin’s war against Ukraine.\nMaking his first visit to Europe in five years, Xi was pressed on these issues early last week by French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Both are sure to closely watch any summit between Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin in China, expected to happen soon.\nIn Paris, Xi stressed that China was playing no role other than “contributing to reaching peace” in Ukraine, and denied there was industrial “overcapacity” in China flooding the European market.\nSuch tensions vanished when Xi met Vucic and Orban.\nHis visits to Serbia and Hungary “send a very good message to a Chinese (domestic) audience that ‘we have close friends in Europe… Hungary and Serbia are real friends that we can do business with,’” said Philippe Le Corre, a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis, speaking at an event hosted by the center as Xi’s tour got underway last week.\nBut the countries’ inclusion in his itinerary was “embarrassing” for Paris, because both Orban and Vucic attended the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing last October alongside Putin, Le Corre added.\nXi’s visits to Serbia and Hungary helped him toward another goal – chipping away at a world order he sees as dominated by the United States.\nWith the inking of a joint statement, Serbia’s Vucic became the first European leader to commit to joining China in building a “community with a shared future.” The loosely formulated concept calls for a collaboration on shared interests, suggesting countries shouldn’t interact based on alliances, or be judged on their domestic politics and human rights record.\n“That is the highest level of cooperation of two countries and I am proud that as a president of Serbia I had an opportunity to sign that declaration with President Xi,” Vucic said Wednesday of the accord, which came alongside a free-trade agreement and other pledges from Xi on expanding agricultural imports and direct flights.\nXi also marketed a shared worldview during his meeting with Orban in Hungary, which is a member of both the EU and NATO. Orban, whose increasingly authoritarian rule has raised alarm within the EU, defied mounting concerns within both blocs to upgrade his country’s relations to an “all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership.”\nRelated card\nChina has a sweeping vision to reshape the world – and countries are listening\nAs well as being another symbolic win for Xi, this could encourage Orban to push back against efforts within the EU to “derisk” supply chains and slap tariffs on Chinese goods, analysts say. Speaking in Budapest Thursday alongside Orban, Xi appeared to allude to that, saying he hoped Hungary would use its rotating EU presidency beginning in July to “promote the stable and healthy development of China-EU relations.”\nThe two leaders also signed some 18 cooperation agreements, which Orban said covered sectors such as railways, IT, and nuclear energy. Xi declared the two countries would “deepen economic, trade, investment, and financial cooperation” and advance “key projects,” including the Budapest-Belgrade railway.\nBoth Serbia and Hungary are already key destinations for Chinese investment, with Hungary emerging as an increasingly important production hub in Europe for Chinese automotive suppliers including electric vehicle (EV) makers. In France earlier this week, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told journalists that Chinese company BYD was “welcome” to open a factory in France; but the EV giant appears to have already chosen its first foothold for car production in Europe, pledging late last year to open a plant in Hungary.\nBeijing may also be hoping other countries on the continent take note, with analysts saying all this plays into Xi’s efforts to frame parts of Europe as benefiting from clearheaded views on China, versus others who are mimicking American efforts to contain it.\n“Being close to these countries fits China’s domestic narrative that there are ‘smart countries’ in Europe who really understand China and do not support the United States – and China is working with these countries for the good of Europe,” said Liu Dongshu, an assistant professor of public and international affairs at Hong Kong’s City University.\nBut Xi’s itinerary also underscores his limitations within Europe, others say, including in Central and Eastern Europe where Beijing previously made extensive efforts to deepen connections and win goodwill, including through Xi’s flagship Belt and Road infrastructure drive.\nA Chinese mechanism to bolster relations with 16 Central and Eastern European nations has slowly lost support, in part because investments didn’t materialize at the expected scale, and also because China’s support for Russia soured relations in a region with a recent history of Soviet domination.\n“The unlimited partnership and Beijing’s moral and material support to Moscow has infuriated many (Central and Eastern European) countries’ leadership and population,” said Tamas Matura, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis. “This has definitely weakened China’s position in Europe.”\nRelated article\nIn Europe, Xi looks to counter claims China is aiding Russia in Ukraine\nMeanwhile, longstanding tensions with Nordic countries and Italy’s exit earlier this year from the Belt and Road, as well as recent visits to China by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, meant none of those countries were ideal for Xi to visit, Matura added. France, he said, was likely seen by Beijing as creating a potential for a diplomatic opening given its advocacy for Europe’s strategic autonomy from the US.\nBut there were few tangible signs from the trip that friction with Western European countries and the EU would abate, despite both Macron and Von der Leyen stressing the importance of dialogue and Xi’s two-day visit with the French president, which included a more personal trip to the Pyrenees and the signing of 18 cooperation deals.\nAnd despite their limited economic heft – with 16 million people between them, and a combined GDP about a tenth of France’s, according to IMF figures – Serbia and EU member Hungary may become increasingly valuable to Beijing as tensions with the bloc continue, and the threat of a trade war looms.\n“Orban and Vucic are both the kind of illiberal leaders who are positioning their countries between the rivaling geo-political blocs, hoping to avoid too strong dependence on any one of them,” said former Hungarian member of Parliament Gabor Scheiring, an assistant professor of comparative politics at Georgetown University in Qatar. “They don’t care about democracy or human rights. For them, foreign policy is strictly pragmatically about economic interests.”\nAnd that could be a boon for China.\n“Hungary and Serbia are strategic gateways for Beijing toward Europe…  the value of the two countries as gateways to Europe will increase as the trade war escalates,” he said.\nCNN’s Xiaofei Xu contributed to this report.\n",

        "content": "There’s nothing quite like settling back into your train seat, the urban skyline out the window fading into lush natural landscapes as you make your way to your next destination.\nAccording to rail experts, an increasing number of luxury travelers are looking to experience this sensation, all part of a global shift towards slower and more sustainable tourism activities.\nAnantara is among the hospitality giants now tapping into this demand, with the high-end hotel brand offering a new five-hour luxury train experience in southern Vietnam that connects the popular resort destinations of Na Trang and Quy Nhon – its second route in the country.\nThe first “The Vietage by Anantara” luxury train carriage launched in 2020 – a six-hour journey connecting Da Nang and Quy Nhon.\nAnanatara’s head of PR and marketing for Vietnam, Kate Jones tells CNN the new carriage heads in the opposite direction and aims to expose travelers to even more of Vietnam’s beautiful views. Like the first Vietage carriage, it will be attached to Vietnam’s state-run commercial railway that runs up and down the country.\n“The main difference is that the new route connecting Nha Trang and Quy Nhon passes through many more coastal areas than the journey between Da Nang and Quy Nhon,” says Jones.\n“There is a selection of really quite stunning bays and some striking coastline facing the East Sea. There are some mountainous areas and still plenty of rice paddies and lotus ponds, but the coastal scenery is the biggest view ‘pull’ for this five-hour journey.”\nThis is slow travel at its best – the trains hit an average speed of 51.9 kilometers per hour (32.2 mph) according to Anantara.\nThat gives guests on the Quy Nhon-Nha Trang route plenty of time to enjoy their complimentary afternoon tea set, which includes local caviar, Vietnamese artisanal cheeses, a selection of cold cuts and premium Vietnamese teas.\nFor the six-hour journeys between Da Nang and Quy Nhon, passengers are served a pre-ordered three-course gourmet meal.\nGuests on either route also get complimentary snacks, free-flow wine, cocktails, mocktails, teas, coffee and soft drinks, plus a 15-minute head and shoulder treatment.\nThe Vietage carriage is fitted out with a sit-up bar, restroom facilities and six private booths that seat two, each of which comes with power outlets, charging stations, free wifi and amenity baskets with pillows, blankets and other essentials.\nTravelers can reserve their seats online at Thevietagetrain.com, while those wanting to combine their rail journeys with a stay at one of Anantara’s properties – – Anantara Hoi An Resort, Anantara Quy Nhon Villas or Avani Quy Nhon Resort – can book packages through those individual hotel websites.\nThe cost of a one-way Vietage journey is $420 per person. The new route departs from Nha Trang Train Station at 2 p.m., arriving at Dieu Tri Station in Quy Nhon at 6:29 p.m. For those preferring to travel in the opposite direction, trains depart Dieu Tri Train Station at 2:15 p.m. - arriving at Nha Trang Train Station at 6:36 p.m.\nRelated article\nThis train route is being revived after over 100 years\nThe original route departs from Da Nang Train Station at 8 a.m., arriving at Quy Nhon’s Dieu Tri Station at 2:03 p.m. There is also an evening option that departs Quy Nhon at 7:00 p.m., arriving in Da Nang at 12:53 a.m. the following day. This Vietage journey is slightly cheaper, costing $315 per passenger.\nAs for demand, Jones says many are turning to rail travel rather than “rushing through airports to get from A to B.”\n“The domestic aviation industry in Vietnam right now is also facing some challenges with the disappearance of two airlines and a reduced fleet with the national carrier, so overall air travel is currently not popular, plus overly expensive,” she says.\n“The Vietage is the only experience of its kind in Vietnam and, of course, with the return of the Belmond train, the awareness of luxury rail travel is growing in Southeast Asia.”\nIn addition to traveling slowly and more sustainably, Jones says rail travelers gain real visual insights into the country, taking in scenes like “rural villages, fishermen casting their nets, farmers in fields with the water buffaloes – things you definitely don’t experience at 35,000 feet.”\n",

Now an economic slump and the emergence of ferocious local competitors means those bets look less safe as price wars erupt.\nDiscounts and special deals are being offered across consumer brands from food and clothing to consumer electronics and cars, reflecting a dramatic shift in consumption patterns in the world’s second largest economy.\nOne of the most intense price wars is raging in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, where a “life and death” race has manufacturers scrambling for survival.\nTesla’s China market share shrank to 4% in April, almost halving from 7.7% in March, according to data released by the China Passenger Car Association on Friday. Deliveries from its Shanghai factory, its largest globally, fell 18% last month from a year earlier.\nThe sharp drop contrasts with rising sales by its biggest Chinese rival BYD, which reported a 29% jump in pure EV deliveries.\n“Everyone has changed the way they think about China,” said Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder and managing principal at J Capital Research. “The business climate has changed entirely.”\nLast month, Tesla (TSLA) announced aggressive price cuts in the country, shortly after also reducing prices in the United States and Germany. The move added to a series of price reductions that it has made in its biggest overseas market since late 2022.\nLast year, the Chinese economy grew 5.2%. Outside the pandemic years, that was its slowest pace of annual expansion since 1990, when gross domestic product increased only 3.9% because of international sanctions following the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.\nConsumers have curtailed spending as their job and income prospects worsened. A prolonged crisis in real estate, which accounts for 70% of household wealth, and a stock market meltdown have added to their woes.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk makes a surprise visit to China, it coincides with Beijing's auto show where reports suggest he is trying to export his company's self-driving technology. CNN's Marc Stewart has more.\n\nRelated video\nElon Musk makes surprise visit to China, meets senior trade officials\nIn the 1990s, “every company in the West” was hiring consultants and having boardroom meetings about how to do more in China, according to Stevenson-Yang. But now the consultants are gone and rather than talking about how to tap into rapid growth, the C-suite discussions are all about “getting out, protecting one’s operations or balancing supply among several countries.”\n“China now is somewhere around the status of a Brazil — big, important but difficult,” she added.\nThe country’s economic woes aren’t confined to Tesla and the EV industry either. They’re hitting other American corporate giants like Apple (AAPL), Starbucks (STUX) and McDonald’s (MCD): all struggling to adjust their business strategies for a rapidly changing market.\nWorries about the future have forced Chinese consumers to be more budget-conscious, said Yang Wang, senior analyst for Counterpoint Research. As a result, purchases associated with premium or luxury have taken a back seat.\n“Certainly Chinese consumers are experiencing ‘downgraded consumption’ in general,” he said.\nApple’s overall revenue in Greater China — including mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao — fell 8% to $16.4 billion in the fiscal quarter ending March 30.\nMeanwhile, Huawei, a Chinese tech champion that the West once tried to kill off, has been advancing rapidly. Its smartphone sales soared 70% in the first quarter of 2024, boosted by the successful launch of its Mate 60 series, according to data compiled by Counterpoint Research.\nRelated article\nHuawei sales are soaring in China as Apple sinks\n“[China] is the most competitive market in the world,” said Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, at an earnings call with analysts earlier this month. He added that he continues to feel optimistic about the Chinese market in the long term.\nThe US smartphone maker has cut prices for iPhones sold in China, which helped its shipments jump in March, according to data published last week by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, a government-backed research firm. It marked a turnaround from the previous two months of 2024, when Apple saw a deep slump in iPhone sales.\nThe price reductions were led by Apple and third-party retailing platforms, with some iPhone 15 models offered at discounts of as much as 20%.\nCoffee chains have also scrambled to undercut each other’s prices. Last February, Cotti Coffee, a startup founded by two former Luckin Coffee executives, began a campaign to slash latte prices to as low as 9.9 yuan ($1.4).\nThe move prompted Luckin, which is the country’s largest coffee chain, to match that price. Cotti then slashed latte prices again to 8.8 yuan ($1.2).\nThe aggressive discounts have affected global brands. Even Starbucks, which had signalled it had no interest in a price war in China, started offering coupons that effectively lowered its latte prices to below 20 yuan ($2.8). They normally sell for 30 yuan ($4.2).\nRelated article\nIn China’s battle of the lattes, Luckin Coffee keeps beating Starbucks\nThe average check paid by a Starbucks customer declined 9% in China in the first quarter of the year, mainly because of promotions and lower sales of higher priced merchandise, the company said.\n“Our consumers are now more cautious in their spending,” said Belinda Wong, chairwoman and co-CEO of Starbucks China, on an earnings call in January. “You see mass influx of mass market competitors focus on fast store expansion and low price tactics to drive trial.”\nFast food chains have also gotten into the act.\n“Poor man’s deal” has become a trending term among Chinese youth since 2022. It initially referred to McDonald’s “1+1 = 13.9-yuan pair as you wish” $1.90 set meal, which was extremely popular among customers.\nOther Western fast food chains have subsequently jumped on the bandwagon, launching their own low-price set meals.\nOnline guides for getting weekly fast food discounts have gone viral on social media.\n“Mondays at McDonalds for free McNuggets, Tuesdays at Tastien for a ‘one-for-one’ offer, Wednesdays at Dominos for 30% off, Thursdays at KFC for the ‘crazy Thursday’ deal, Fridays at Burger King for a half-priced weekday set deal, then heading to Wallace for the weekends. Repeat next week,” according to one guide.\nNanchengxiang, a Beijing-based fast food chain, has even launched an ultra-cheap “ 3 yuan (41 cents) breakfast buffet,” setting a record low price for all you can eat meals.\nThe set, dubbed by many netizens as “a must-have for poor people working in Beijing,” has more than doubled sales during breakfast hours, according to canyin168, a data tracking and analytical website in the catering industry.\nThe “depressed” consumer sentiment is likely to stay for a while, said Yang from Counterpoint Research.\nSome Western brands “inevitably” will be forced to reconsider pricing to defend market share.\nHowever, that will be “no easy fix,” as foreign brands are at a disadvantage vis-a-vis domestic brands due to higher operating costs, he added.\nRelated article\nChina will focus on ‘high-quality, sustainable growth,’ central bank chief says\nHe doesn’t think they’re likely to pull out of the country though.\nOver the medium to long term, China is still set to drive global economic growth and contribute to the largest growing cohort of middle-class consumers.\n“With depressed economic prospects in most developed countries, and still some catching up to do for key emerging market growth markets like India, China could still offer the most lucrative market globally, even with depressed consumption levels,” he said.\nBut expectations will have to be lowered.\n“I think the fundamental mistake that many Western companies made in China was to believe in the myth of a rising middle class,” said Stevenson-Yang.\n“In reality, Chinese people had a ton of money from capital gains in real estate and the stock market; They never had big increases in income. The economy is not reverting to the poverty levels of the 1980s, but there is a lot of dialing back being done.”\n",

        "content": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex embarked on what was officially dubbed a 3-day private visit to Nigeria, yet it unfolded with all the grandeur and attention typically reserved for royal tours.\nTheir first day saw them receive a red-carpet welcome complete with cultural dancers following their arrival in the Nigerian capital of Abuja, where they kicked off a multi-day mental health summit at Lightway Academy.\nThere, they also unveiled a partnership between their Archewell Foundation and the GEANCO Foundation to provide students with school supplies and menstrual products.\nThe pair had been invited to the West African nation by the country’s highest-ranking military official, Christopher Musa. After meeting him at the Nigerian Defence Headquarters, Meghan signed a guest book thanking officials for “welcoming me home.”\nDespite the private nature of their visit, the couple’s itinerary resembled previous official tours they carried out before stepping back as senior working royals in 2020.\nThey were warmly received everywhere they went, with Nigerians showcasing their famed hospitality. The couple were showered with gifts, including a touching portrait of a young Harry with his mum.\nFor both Nigeria and the Sussexes, this visit held significant weight.\nIt was an opportunity for Nigeria to demonstrate its capability to host such high-profile guests and dispel any doubts raised by skeptics, especially considering the country’s standing in the eyes of the UK’s Foreign Office as one of the most dangerous countries to visit in the world.\nNigeria has security issues with a terrorist insurgency in the northeast and northwest. However, it is a huge country —  larger than the US state of Texas  — and the other areas visited by the royal couple over the past several days are relatively safe.\nRelated article\n‘We love you’: Harry plays volleyball with army veterans as he and Meghan get warm welcome in Nigeria\nMeanwhile, for Prince Harry and Meghan, this marked their first major trip to Africa since relinquishing their official royal duties.\nIt was a chance for them to engage in a hearts-and-minds charm offensive, which they executed with aplomb.\nMeghan, in particular, embraced exploring her Nigerian ancestry after discovering several years ago that she is 43% Nigerian through a genealogy test.\nOn Saturday, she co-hosted a women’s leadership event with Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director-General of the World Trade Organisation, for about 50 leading women from across Nigerian society and politics, business, media, and culture.\nDuring a panel discussion, moderated by Nigerian media mogul Mo Abudu, the duchess spoke passionately about uncovering her Nigerian roots and its significance to her own identity.\nShe described Nigeria as “my country,” adding that “being African American, part of it is not knowing so much about your lineage or background, where you come from specifically. And it was exciting … to discover more and understand what that really means.”\nIt was here that Meghan’s natural ability to connect really shone through. She chatted effortlessly with attendees, posed for selfies and engaged in heartfelt conversations.\nAt another event on Sunday at the prestigious Delborough Hotel in Lagos - where the great and good of Nigerian society had gathered to welcome the coupl -  she appeared visibly moved when three powerful traditional rulers honored her with royal titles.\nThe Obi of Onitsha, His Majesty Igwe Nnaemeka Alfred Ugochukwu Achebe christened Meghan “Ada Mazi,” which means “the daughter of the Igbo ancestral palace.”\nWhile, the Oluwo of Iwoland, southwest, Nigeria, Oba Abdulrasheed Adewale Akanbi christened her with the Yoruba name of “Adetokunbo” which means “royalty from across the seas.”\nTheir engagements during the three-day visit were centered around their core passions: sports rehabilitation, mental health, and women’s empowerment.\nFor Harry’s part, the duke demonstrated his compassion and connection to his late mother, Princess Diana, as he visited wounded soldiers at a military hospital in Kaduna, 150 miles from Abuja.\nHis first stop was to drop in on the governor of Kaduna state, Senator Uba Sani, where he was again welcomed by a troupe of dancers and a red carpet. Governor Sani sat opposite him and praised Harry as a “symbol of courage and “praised his service to his country.”\nHe added, “Please give our regards to the Duchess of Sussex, Princess Meghan.”\nHarry toured about six wards and met young men recuperating from their injuries. Many had been shot, ambushed by Boko Haram or lost limbs due to blasts. One moment captured by a photographer showing Harry holding a wounded soldier lying on the hospital bed during the visit resonated deeply and went viral on social media.\nCorporal Yusef, 23, who had been shot through the knee, spoke with the duke, who asked him about his rehab. “Are you going to try for the Invictus Games team? Are you preparing for that?… We will see you there,” Harry suggested.\nTheir visit also extended to cultural experiences, such as witnessing a vibrant dance performance and a polo match at the historic Lagos Polo Club.\nPolo holds special significance for Harry and the event provided a platform to showcase his longstanding commitment to the sport and its charitable endeavors.\nAmid the festivities, the couple expressed gratitude for Nigeria’s warm reception. As they bid farewell to Nigeria, Meghan declared: “I can’t wait to come back!”\n",

        "content": "From the blooming azaleas of Augusta National to the breathtaking lighthouse at Turnberry in Scotland, golf is renowned for its natural beauty. The same cannot be said, however, for the sport’s primary mode of transport.\nBut one Danish company is on a mission to put the art in golf cart.\nCopenhagen-based Garia is the self-described “world’s first and only” luxury golf and leisure car brand (that’s car, not cart), whose aims to regenerate the traditional golf buggy have led to ambitions that lie far beyond the confines of the 18-hole course.\nSuch goals seemed a long drive away in 2005 when Anders Lynge, still in design school, met Soren Bak Hansen during an internship at a car company. A short while later, having spotted a gap in the market, the duo founded Garia.\n“When it came to the golf cart 18 years ago, they all looked the same – there weren’t any serious high-end products out there,” Lynge told CNN.\n“If you lived in a high-end community – paying hundreds of thousands of dollars of membership fees, a $10 million house, whatever you had – the whole lifestyle of these people, from their cars to their clothes, watches; everything was super personalized.\n“We thought it was strange that they all had the same type of golf cart … So the idea behind Garia was basically to say, ‘How can we make a product that fulfils the lifestyle of these people, that has the same sort of quality that they’re used to from every other product they surround themselves with?’\n“That really changed our focus to say, ‘Hey, let’s do that: the ultimate golf car.’”\nAchieving that aim was easier said than done when the team was effectively tasked with reinventing the wheel and – as Lynge remarked – an unattractive one at that.\nThere are several reasons for the uniformity of the traditional golf buggy, narrow and vertical in shape, Lynge explained. The universal requirement of having to fit onto golf courses and their various cart paths – needing to perform 180-degree turns in a cul-de-sac – limits design creativity.\n“It’s like trying to do a new bicycle or a new motorcycle,” Lynge said. “You’re so heavily constrained from a technical standpoint.\n“It’s the worst kind of shape you can have – it doesn’t look very dynamic. You want something that’s sort of Lamborghini-shaped – very low and wide – but the golf cart is the exact opposite.”\nYet solutions emerged: extending the wheelbase, enlarging the cabin, unprecedented 12-inch alloy wheels without hubcaps that replaced the traditional “deep dish” look, and a double wishbone front suspension – common in sports cars – to boost handling.\nGaria’s vehicles may look bigger and more “muscular” than the average golf cart, but the proportions are the same as any other standard buggy. This is simply a visual “trick” – and far from the only one.\nA storage box tucked behind the seat serves to lift the beltline, slashing cabin space to give it more of a car feel, while accent lines and wheels pushed out to the edges help ground the vehicle.\nLynge toyed extensively with positive and negative space, taking inspiration from Porsche’s 911 to use convex and concave shapes across the car. It makes warehouse storage a “nightmare,” but the visual payoffs are worth the trouble, Lynge says.\nIn fact, it is rare that any two Garias look exactly the same.\nUsing an online configurator inspired by Nike’s shoe customizer, prospective buyers can hand-pick almost every aspect of their vehicle; from body and roof color – 44 options and rising – to wheels and interior features like refrigerators and cup holders. There are millions of possible combinations, Lynge insists.\nGerman luxury car modification firm Mansory, which works with clients including Bentley and Lamborghini, provides a range of accessories and even a full carbon-fiber car.\nRelated article\n16-year-old amateur Kris Kim wows golf world by making cut on PGA Tour debut\nOther collaborations have included German Bugatti supplier Kussmaul, which Garia paired with to build a single, special edition chrome car capable of doing 0 to 40 kilometers per hour (25 miles per hour) in less than two seconds.\nAnother involved Mercedes, whom Lynge first made contact with after winning a competition run by the car giant to design a golf cart. Lynge took the prize ceremony event as an opportunity to pitch a dream that would be realized in 2016 – a Garia golf car inspired by Mercedes-Benz Style.\nRetailing at just under €80,000 ($86,000), the fully carbon-fiber car had twice the battery life and twice the power of a typical Garia, topping out at speeds of 69 kilometers per hour (43 miles per hour).\n“Really expensive … super exclusive, but also the coolest golf car you’ll ever see,” Lynge said.\nIts scarcity means only a select few will have been seen on European roads.\nMaking street legal models was always the plan for Garia, but achieving certification is no easy feat. Extensive – and therefore expensive – safety and crash testing is required to gain road-status, and requirements differ across regions.\nWhile Europe allows for greater speeds, the US employs a strict 40 kilometers per hour (25 miles per hour) legal limit on such vehicles. But that did not discourage Lynge, who saw the prevalence of golf communities in the US as a potentially lucrative market for Garia. The company was sold by the Lars Larsen Group to American golf and utility giant Club Car in 2022.\nThe base version of Garia’s two-seater golf car – without any customization or additional features – has a manufacturer suggested retail price of €14,939 ($16,100), with the four-seater edition starting from €20,189 ($21,770). The street legal variants for both Europe and the US come in at €18,959 ($20,440) for the two-seat model and rise to €21,219 ($22,880) for four seats.\n“We very much felt that these cars are so fun to drive and they are fun to interact with,” Lynge said. “I don’t know the exact percentage, but a great part of our cars are also bought by people who don’t play golf. They are just in a holiday house.”\nAs he looks to the future, Lynges envisions Garia branching out of golf and into the leisure space, becoming “more-and-more car-like” with each passing year, making vehicles suited to urban mobility.\n“If you drive around London, how fast do you even need to go? Forty-three miles per hour is plenty of opportunity, right? There is some weird sort of space there as the market changes into full electric where everything is sort of up in the air,” he said.\n“I don’t know where we’re going to land, but I feel like we have some interesting lessons with us in this journey we’ve been on that puts us in a good position to do mobility, maybe in a wider sense, than just golf.”\n",

        "content": "A month after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the historian Yuval Noah Harari made a bold claim that seemed delusional.\nHarari made his claim in an essay on the heroism of the Ukrainian people. He praised embattled Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, who refused to flee his country when death seemed certain, telling his would-be rescuers that he needed ammunition, not a ride. He marveled at the outnumbered Ukrainian soldiers on Snake Island who told a Russian warship to “go f**k yourself,” and the civilians blocking Russian tanks with their bodies.\n“Nations are ultimately built on stories,” said Harari, author of “Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind.” “Each passing day adds more stories that Ukrainians will not only tell in the dark days ahead, but in the decades and generations to come … This is the stuff nations are built from. In the long run, these stories count for more than tanks.”\nBut there’s another type of story that’s gained traction in the US — the kind that can cause a nation to unravel. The new hit movie, “Civil War,” which has earned more than $100 million worldwide at the box office, is the latest example of a disturbing trend: We no longer seem to know how to tell well-crafted stories that counter those that depict American democracy as doomed.\nIn “Civil War,” tanks trample democracy. The film depicts a near-future America that has been torn apart by seceding regions and militia violence. It features a fascist leader in the White House, an attempted coup and Americans casually killing one another in the streets. One critic called it writer-director Alex Garland’s “very in-your-face attempt to imagine the unimaginable in America.”\nIt’s hard to imagine any other future for the United States when you consider the popularity of movies like “Civil War.” Most of the stories about the state of America that gain traction in popular culture are the ones that end in its failure. They’re the opposite of the hopeful, unifying stories any country needs to overcome tough times.\n“Civil War” is part of a growing entertainment genre that, to borrow a phrase from former President Donald Trump, could be called “American carnage.” Dystopian movies and TV shows like “The Walking Dead,” “The Purge,” “The Hunger Games,” “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “The Last of Us” all imagine a hellish future in America triggered by an environmental, political or civic collapse.\nThere’s nothing wrong with dystopian thrillers. They serve as cautionary tales and are as old as the book of Revelation. But the messages they send may be more dangerous than the violence depicted onscreen: The collapse of democracy is inevitable. Americans can never transcend their tribalism. Resistance is futile.\nThere’s something wrong when we churn out stories about superheroes in spandex banding together from different galaxies to save the universe, but we can’t tell a popular story that shows Americans coming together to save our country.\nIt didn’t used to be this way. There was another time when democracy in America was under threat, and filmmakers responded by making stirring movies aimed at lifting Americans’ spirit and equipping them for the battles ahead.\nConsider “Casablanca,” the classic 1942 film. It proves that you can tell a gripping story about patriotism without being sappy or boring. In the film, Humphrey Bogart plays Rick, the cynical owner of a Moroccan nightclub at the onset of World War II. The movie is remembered today for its classic lines (“Here’s looking at you kid”; “We’ll always have Paris”; “Round up the usual suspects”).\nYet there’s another classic line uttered by Rick — “I stick my neck out for nobody” — that hints at deeper reasons why “Casablanca” was made. The film is set before Pearl Harbor, when many Americans didn’t want to get involved in a European conflict. Adolf Hitler’s Nazi war machine seemed unstoppable. Fascism was on a global march. Democracy’s future seemed grim.\nRick responds to the impending crisis with apathy and cynicism. But when his old flame, played by actress Ingrid Bergman, walks into his club one night, she not only rekindles their romance but his idealism.\n“The movie was a patriotic rallying cry that affirmed a sense of national purpose,” wrote Cristóbal S. Berry-Cabán in an essay. “The film emphasized group effort and the value of individual sacrifices for a larger cause. It portrayed World War II as a peoples’ war, typically featuring a diverse group of people and ethnic backgrounds who are thrown together, tested, and molded into a dedicated (force) fighting fascism.”\nOther films of that era made similar storytelling choices. Legendary Hollywood director Frank Capra made a series of seven patriotic films during World War II called “Why We Fight” that rallied Americans in the fight against fascism.\nThe entertainer Frank Sinatra, a paragon of mid-20th century American masculinity, starred in a short film called “The House We Live In.” It would be labeled “woke” today. In the film, Sinatra intervenes when he sees a group of youths chasing a Jewish boy. He tells them that “religion makes no difference, except to a Nazi or someone who’s stupid.” The film was eventually selected by the Library of Congress as being “culturally and historically” significant.\nSinatra would later record a song with the same title as the film, which he would perform throughout his career. It included lines like, “The faces that I see. All races and religions. That’s America to me.”\nOther World War II-era films like “Don’t be a Sucker,” which emphasized racial and religious tolerance in America, emphasized the same message. It went viral after the 2017 neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\nThose black-and-white films may seem dated and idealistic in an America that has been through the Vietnam War, Watergate, 9/11 and January 6. But a country needs a unifying story like a human being needs oxygen.\n“Stories are essential to holding a nation together,” says Kermit Roosevelt III, a historian and author of “The Nation That Never Was: Reconstructing America’s Story.” “You have to have something that motivates people to make sacrifices for the nation. If you’re going to fight a war, you have to have people who are willing to lay down their lives. But we more often call on people to make sacrifices for others, to bear burdens, promote justice and help out the less fortunate.”\nThat doesn’t mean we return to the days of making clumsy propaganda films. But Roosevelt says we should keep in mind that most stories contain some elements of propaganda.\n“We have this idea that propaganda is bad or ideology is bad,” Roosevelt says. “But I think that history and education are inherently ideological, and there’s a perspective there and you’re trying to impart lessons.”\nSome of America’s most gifted political leaders knew that lesson well. Two of the most consequential presidents in recent memory — Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama — were master storytellers. They told stories that made Americans believe in democracy, in one another and in their country’s future.\nReagan’s skills were on display when he told a story about American vitality in his farewell speech that echoed Sinatra’s “The House We Live In.” He said the source of America’s greatness was immigrants.\n“While other countries cling to the stale past, here in America we breathe life into dreams,” Reagan said. “Thanks to each wave of new arrivals to this land of opportunity, we’re a nation forever young, forever bursting with energy and new ideas, and always on the cutting edge, always leading the world to the world to the next frontier. This quality is vital to our future as a nation.”\nFormer President Obama cited his personal story as a reason to believe in America, despite the country’s history of not living up to its ideals. The son of a White mother from Kansas and a Black father from Kenya, Obama said his journey to national prominence was proof that the American dream was possible.\n“I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on Earth is my story even possible,” he during his speech at the  2004 Democratic National Convention, which would eventually catapult him to the White House.\nIt’s easy to dismiss Reagan’s and Obama’s storytelling as the product of clever speechwriters. What candidate doesn’t call America great, or vow that anything is possible in the land of the free and home of the brave?\nBut the dominant American political figure of recent years does not typically tell such unifying stories about his country. Former President Trump coined the term “American carnage” during his 2017 inaugural address. He routinely describes an America that more resembles the failed state depicted in the “Civil War” movie, with his declaration in January that “We are a nation in decline, we are a failing nation.”\nTelling that kind of story hasn’t appeared to hurt Trump any more than it hurt the makers of “Civil War.” And, truth be told, stories of American greatness can ring hollow to the descendants of enslaved Americans, the Japanese Americans interned during World War II and those dismayed today by politicians and judges who disregard democratic norms.\nHow can we tell a story today that doesn’t ignore the brutality of American history but still inspires hope for the future?\nThere’s another figure from the past who may help us.\nWalt Whitman, the 19th century writer dubbed “the poet of democracy,” said that America was his greatest poem. Through poetry, Whitman did what so many seem incapable of today — he made a multiracial, multireligious democracy in America visceral and exciting, not a civics lesson.\nIn “Songs of Myself,” Whitman vividly described America as “the Nation of many nations,” and said of himself and his country,” “Of every hue and caste am I, of every rank and religion.”\nRead Whitman today and one is struck by his expansive definition of what it means to be an American. No one is excluded — he treats the “boatman and clam-diggers, the farmer, the deacon, the runaway slave, the prostitute and the president with equal reverence, “For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.”\nThe historian Ian Beacock said Whitman offers an answer for those who wonder how they can defend democracy against stories that predict its demise. He suggests they take Whitman’s approach: “State an emotional case for democracy that appeals as much to those who already possess power as to those yet without it.”\nIt starts with being honest about the appeal of other modes of government, like fascism, he says.\n“It’s obvious that being free and equal is better than being dominated,” Beacock wrote.” But is it better than dominating? Exerting power over others is a seductive feeling, too, if a dark and dangerous one.”\nMany democracies simply “unravel” because their citizens get complacent, Beacock says. Democracy is hard to sustain because of its constant demands for compromise. People often go shopping for alternatives that seem like less work, he says.\nWhitman told stories about democracy that engaged people’s feelings, not just their intellect, Beacock says.\n“This is perhaps Whitman’s core contribution to democratic thought and practice: the reminder that democracy’s defenders mustn’t neglect political feelings (“Logic and sermons never convince”) and that self-government must appeal to the human heart if it is to last long. “\nThe Austrian philosopher Ivan Illich was once asked about the most revolutionary way to change a society. He said:\n“Neither revolution nor reformation can ultimately change a society, rather you must tell a new powerful tale, one so persuasive that it sweeps away the old myths and becomes the preferred story, one so inclusive that it gathers all the bits of our past and our present into a coherent whole, one that even shines some light into our future so that we can take the next step…”\nHow Americans in 2024 decide to tell their national story is up for debate. What shouldn’t be up for discussion, though, is the need for such stories. Isn’t it time we tell a new story of a future America where the White House isn’t going up in flames and citizens aren’t murdering one another?\nThe box office success of “Civil War” ensures, though, that more “American carnage” stories are likely headed our way. Though the film doesn’t take any political sides, it amplifies the same message that autocrats in Russia and China are making through their propaganda: America is hopelessly divided and degenerate, and democracy is doomed.\nMaybe it’s time to rediscover what Americans of another era knew. Those old black-and-white films about what makes America special may seem corny now. But they understood that you must defend democracy not only with tanks, but with stirring tales that reverberate for generations to come.\nIf you believe democracy is under threat in America, find a “new powerful tale” that inspires us to believe it has a future.\nBut don’t dispense platitudes or give us a civics lesson.\nTell us a story.\nJohn Blake is a Senior Writer at CNN and the author of “More Than I Imagined: What a Black Man Discovered About the White Mother He Never Knew.”\n",

        "content": "Vladimir Putin, Muammar Gaddafi, Mark Zuckerberg. Presidents and Hollywood stars; political dissidents, abuse survivors and immigrants. One thing unites them all: a slightly scuffed, white wooden box.\n“More world leaders have sat on that box than any chair in history,” the photographer Platon, owner of that very box, told CNN in an interview conducted over Zoom. For some world leaders, the scarcity of his set — sitting on the box in front of a plain black or white sheet of paper — can be intimidating, stripping them of their usual grandeur. For others it’s liberating, allowing the human to shine through the professional storyteller. For the subjects of Platon’s new book “The Defenders,” the box became an opportunity.\n“There’s a statement that’s quite common in the human rights community,” Platon said. “‘Giving a voice to the voiceless’. I have learned through my experiences that it’s not right to say that. They have beautiful, powerful, strong voices; the issue is that those voices have been ignored.” Through his work, he explained his mission is to help amplify people’s stories, tuning into their humanity as though they were “an old-fashioned radio”.\nBorn in Greece in 1968, Platon Antoniou moved to the UK aged eight and completed his studies in photography at the Royal College of Art, before leaving London for a career in New York. There, he worked on George magazine with John Kennedy Jr. and as a staff photographer at the New Yorker magazine.\n“The Defenders” takes a different tack to Platon’s earlier work. As a young photographer, he confessed he was dazzled by the world of politicians and celebrities he was working with, walking the corridors of the Kremlin and Downing Street and “having a chat about life” in George Clooney’s garden. Turning his lens to the powerless, by contrast, has upturned his ideas of power altogether.\nRelated article\nThe photographer who changed the way the world saw New York\n“Having photographed all these world leaders, often the people I meet in the trenches of the human rights movement are proper leaders,” he said. “They transform their adversity into compassion for others. And that’s something I very rarely see on that level in the political sphere. So I called them — I call the book — “The Defenders,” because it’s a superhero title. These are ordinary people who do extraordinary things, and I do think of them as superheroes. Changing the narrative is very important for me.”\nAmong “The Defenders” are Burmese and Egyptian dissidents, the imprisoned Russian punk band Pussy Riot, and survivors of sexual violence at Dr. Denis Mukwege’s Panzi Hospital in Congo. One of the girls that Platon photographed there was Esther Faraja. She appeared in an episode of Netflix’s “Abstract: The Art of Design,” profiling Platon, although he said the details of the trauma she suffered were “too harsh to put in the film.”\n“As I was taking the picture, she wasn’t crying,” he recalled. “I’m a privileged, middle-aged white man, and I’m a mess. I said to her, ‘how is it that I’m crying, and you’re not crying? And yet, you’re the one that has suffered?’ And she said: ‘the reason I don’t cry in your picture is because I don’t want to make you feel sad. I don’t want anyone to feel sad when they look at a picture of me. My mommy and daddy brought me into this world to bring joy to the world. And I will keep my promise’.” Platon is as awestruck now as he was standing in front of her. “Now that is a leader,” he said. “I made a promise to her that I will deliver her message of compassion and strength, combined, to as many people as I can.”\n“The Defenders” is an attempt to tell dozens of stories like hers, each captured in one 500th of a second. “Time is a very interesting concept; it doesn’t really ever exist,” Platon mused. “You try to freeze a moment that helps us understand the past and will still be relevant in the future. And yet, it was a moment in the present. And it was such a tiny fragment of a moment that if you blinked, you wouldn’t even have seen it.”\nTwo political giants offer obvious examples of time’s bizarre effect. Vladimir Putin, photographed by Platon for Time’s Person of the Year in 2007, initially liked the image that Platon produced. He appears powerful. In the time since its publication, however, the same image has been taken, edited, and circulated by political dissidents to mock Putin and belittle his power.\nRelated article\nWhy this morning-after portrait of Faye Dunaway became an iconic Hollywood moment\n“I heard in the last two years that anyone who’s caught circulating my picture in connection with human rights issues will go to jail,” Platon said. “Now, it’s the same picture. And Putin likes it.”\nBill Clinton, on a December 2000 cover of Esquire courtesy of Platon, has also been changed with age. “At the time, that picture represented insane levels of charisma,” Platon recalled. “He was great with people — everyone says there’s no one more charismatic than Bill Clinton. We look at it through a different lens now, but it’s the same picture. When I get it right, that same picture works for everybody.”\nIt doesn’t work for Hillary Clinton, though. “Hillary refuses to sit for me,” Platon noted. “She’s one of the only politicians who’s ever said no. And that’s interesting. The ‘no’ now is actually as interesting as the ‘yes’.”\nDistilling broad, complicated, emotional human stories into one fleeting moment is a tribulation of all photography, including that of world leaders, but it was particularly difficult when it came to the sensitive topics broached in “The Defenders”. “Many of (the people photographed) risk their lives and their security telling me these stories,” Platon said. “I cannot be reckless. I cannot be — I must not be — a thrill-seeker.”\nExerting due diligence and handling sensitive subjects thoughtfully is something that Platon admits is a luxury of time; he is able to spend months on a project, producing the most considered and provoking images he can. Increasingly, however, a lot of the photography flooding social media is taken hastily, captured on phones and shared without so much as a pause for breath. In “The Defenders,” Platon remembers the Burmese politician Aung San Suu Kyi coming out of house arrest and being bewildered by the sea of smartphones pointed at her.\n“Now everyone’s a photographer, and everyone’s a filmmaker,” Platon observed. “In many ways, that’s fantastic. People are holding the powers that be accountable in a new way. The danger is that there’s so much information that we’re constantly distracted. It’s very difficult to get that moment of reflection and pause, and to stand back and think for yourself. As you’re even doing that, your phone is dinging and clicking and beeping — it’s constant noise.”\nIn standing back, Platon was able to join the dots between the movements he was documenting; they weren’t isolated struggles, he realized, but connected ones. “Obviously each geopolitical situation is inherently different, but they are all fighting for very basic human principles,” he said. “I photographed LGBTQ+ defenders in Burma and in Russia. That’s two very, very different countries, with the same cause.”\nIn capturing and amplifying the stories of “The Defenders,” Platon hopes to inspire and instruct other people, just as he was inspired and instructed.\n“It’s really a handbook to the new generation to say: roll up your sleeves, get involved. Society needs a new generation of activists who will think differently. They will have a different path to navigate, but the principles remain timeless and the same. It’s the principles that unite us all. The way we fight, the tools we fight with, the strategies — we have to change those, because times change. But the principles stay the same.”\n“The Defenders”, published by MW Editions, is available now.\n",

        "content": "It is one of the world’s oldest running annual sporting fixtures which, over the years, has featured a British Prime Minister, international cricketers and the Romantic poet Lord Byron.\nFor more than 200 years, Eton and Harrow – two of England’s most expensive private schools – have faced off against each other at Lord’s, the cricket ground in North London steeped in history and referred to as the “home of cricket.”\nBut the fixture has become increasingly controversial and indicative of many British institutions’ attempts to reconcile their traditions with becoming more inclusive. The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which owns Lord’s, sought to axe the match from the ground’s schedule before granting it a reprieve after some of its members protested.\nThose arguing for its removal expressed “an appetite to promote cricket as a game for all and as a place where all feel welcome” while those against it stressed the need to maintain “the Club’s history and traditions,” as an MCC statement put it.\nAs a compromise, the MCC announced in March that it would host both the Eton vs. Harrow and Oxford vs. Cambridge fixtures for another five years, before another consultation with members.\nThe club will also host the finals of the UK’s school and university cricket competitions, rather than only the historic fixtures.\nActor, presenter and writer Stephen Fry, the current president of the MCC, called on members last year, in an interview with British newspaper The Times, to support stopping the match at Lord’s to help cricket “lose that image it sometimes still has – a turgid image of snobbery and elitism.”\n“That’s not what cricket is about,” he added. “It’s the second most popular sport in the world and it needs people to understand what a wonderful game it is, and how it’s available for everybody.”\n“No-one could have foreseen quite how divided the Club became on this issue,” MCC chair Bruce Carnegie-Brown said in a statement in March, “and the Committee deserves credit for implementing a pragmatic solution that gives those divisions the opportunity to heal, yet also leaves a sensible review mechanism in place.”\nFor the moment, the schoolboys of Eton and Harrow continue to play each other every year on the hallowed, carefully maintained grass at Lord’s. They took to the field on Friday and Harrow emerged victorious by just four runs.\n",

Maybe a work of romantasy is captivating you instead. Whatever your flavor of escapism, it’s likely that it could be classified as a “beach read” — that oft-dismissed, unofficial category of books that readers gravitate toward in the warmer months.\nBut what exactly constitutes a beach read? And where did that idea come from? Here’s what to know about the popular term.\nA beach read is, naturally, the sort of book one might read at the beach — or at a lake, a resort or another typical summer destination.\nThe books populating “beach read” round-ups from booksellers, publishers and periodicals generally fall into the category of commercial fiction, designed to lure in readers with their saturated covers and playful illustrations. They’re also almost always marketed to women.\nAmanda Bergeron, who acquires contemporary and historical book club fiction for Penguin Random House’s imprint Berkley, has published several authors whose books frequently appear on “beach read” lists: Carley Fortune, Jasmine Guillory and Emily Henry, to name a few. When looking for the next big summer read, Bergeron says she’s drawn to fast-paced stories with compelling characters. If it transports the reader to another location, all the better.\n“It’s something that you’re excited to spend time with and you can’t put down — something that you’re just so eager to get back to that it will go with you wherever you go, whether that’s the park, the pool, the couch, your yard or even the beach,” she says.\nSome books just scream summer, presenting an obvious opportunity to be marketed as a beach read, according to Bergeron. If it takes place in the summer, perhaps on an island or another breezy locale, there’s a good chance it could be a beach read. Sometimes, the “beach read” designation is so fitting that it announces itself in the title, like Fortune’s 2022 romance novel “Every Summer After,” Jenn McKinlay’s 2023 rom-com “Summer Reading” or Henry’s aptly named 2020 “Beach Read.”\nWhile the romance genre tends to dominate the “beach read” landscape, the label isn’t limited to romance, says Bergeron. A beach read can just as easily be a suspenseful thriller or a puzzle-box mystery novel — at least for Bergeron, it’s a book that readers will want to discuss with others and bring along with them on vacation.\nIn other words, a beach read doesn’t ask the reader to ponder the grim realities of the modern world or plunge into the depths of the human experience. Rather, it offers a break from the slog of daily life and the constant drumbeat of depressing news stories.\n“For God’s sake, I do not want to be challenged,” Celeste Ballard declared in a 2014 humor column for The New Yorker about how to pick a summer read. “No ‘hard’ literature that I have to slog through to discover a deep and twisted meaning.”\nEven though the “beach read” designation can go hand in hand with commercial success (books labeled as such frequently make bestseller lists), it’s also a loaded term.\nAuthor Jennifer Weiner, whose books are often categorized as beach reads, rejected the label for years before eventually embracing it — an internal conflict she examined in a 2020 essay for Goodreads.\n“It’s not hard to discern a whiff of Coppertone-scented sexism in the label,” she wrote. “Fast-paced, diverting books that are by or for men are called thrillers or mysteries or sometimes just plain old books, while the ladies get every kind of label, from chick lit to women’s fiction to upmarket women’s fiction to domestic fiction to, well, beach books.”\nBooks labeled as beach reads tend to emphasize plot and characters over elegant prose and heavier themes. To some, the implication is that the book is less serious or less worthy of one’s time.\nDakota Johnson, who launched a book club earlier this year, seemed to echo that assumption in an interview with Bustle: “Our book club is literary fiction. It’s not beach reads. It’s not silly,” she said.\nThough the term “beach read” is commonly associated with frothy romance novels, Bergeron says that notion can be reductive. Beach reads can absolutely be frivolous — sometimes, that’s exactly what you need — but some of the most celebrated beach reads of the past few years explore weightier topics all while delivering on the promise of fun.\nFor instance, Fortune’s 2023 bestseller “Meet Me at the Lake” depicted postpartum anxiety and the loss of a family member, while Kiley Reid’s buzzy 2019 debut “Such A Fun Age” dealt with race and privilege. “A Love Like the Sun,” a forthcoming novel from Riss M. Neilson, includes representation of chronic illness.\n“The fact that writers are able to do all that and offer readers an escape or a big heart hug is just really exciting,” Bergeron says.\nThe term “beach read” first appeared in literary periodicals around 1990, according to an article by the Los Angeles Public Library — though it’s unclear who coined it.\nThe concept of the summer read goes back much further, says Donna Harrington-Lueker, a professor of English and communications at Salve Regina University and author of Books for Idle Hours: Nineteenth-Century Publishing and the Rise of Summer Reading. Though now ingrained in our culture, the notion of summer reading was actually a 19th century invention of the publishing industry that sprung up in response to the creation of the summer vacation.\nSummer reading was initially a ritual enjoyed by rich men, who could afford to engage in leisure travel and unwind with poetry and literature, according to Harrington-Lueker. That changed in the mid-to-late 19th century as the US rapidly industrialized after the Civil War. The construction of railroads and grand hotels made summer vacations more accessible for the middle classes, giving rise to what Harrington-Lueker calls the “summer novel.”\nThe summer novel was specifically geared toward women, Harrington-Lueker explains. The books generally took place over the summer at a resort and tended to follow the rhythms of the season: There might be scenes anchored around a picnic or a fireworks display, with detailed descriptions of what the female characters were wearing. Typically, the books ended with the heroine getting engaged.\n“These become lessons in how you practice summer leisure, and they become very popular,” Harrington-Lueker says.\nThe proliferation of the summer novel also generated backlash from some religious leaders who considered them a temptation and devoid of morality. The Reverend T. De Witt Talmage notably declared in an 1876 sermon that “there is more pestiferous trash read among the intelligent classes in July and August than in all the other ten months of the year.”\n“Would it not be an awful thing for you to be struck with lightning some day when you had in your hand one of these paper-covered romances—the hero a Parisian roué, the heroine an unprincipled flirt … ?” he chided at the time.\nBut throughout the late 1800s, the publishing industry worked to counter such notions and present summer reading as something desirable, Harrington-Lueker says. Magazines such as The Atlantic Monthly or Harper’s ran advertisements with women clad in muslin dresses, novel in hand, while literary critics extolled the benefits of lighter reading.\n“The cakes and ale of literature have their legitimate time and place after the more solid intellectual dishes of the past season have been digested,” an 1887 editorial in the literary review Book Buyer reads.\nMuch like today, summer reads at the time were seen as an escape from the turmoil of the real world. One 1885 magazine column Harrington-Lueker encountered in her research called that summer’s novels “peculiarly trivial” and hypothesized that publishers were responding to the cholera epidemic, believing “that the general mind will be so far distraught by anxiety as to have no attention to spare for being critical.”\nAs publishers solidified the association between summer and light reading, some institutions promoted more serious reading during the season, Harrington-Lueker said.\nOne notable example is the Chautauqua movement, a late 19th and early 20th century educational program that sought to help Americans improve themselves through reading. From schools requiring students to read so-called classics in the summer to the anti-racist reading lists that were ubiquitous in 2020, the idea of summer as a time for personal enrichment persists today. Indeed, some people reach for heftier titles during vacation precisely because they finally have the time to dig into them.\n“Summer reading becomes a point where people automatically begin to think, ‘How should we be spending our summer? Should we be spending it with escapist fiction that’s going to renew us, that’s going to give us this time apart from a more difficult world? Or should we be using it to engage with topics of more consequence?’” Harrington-Lueker says.\nThat push and pull between reading as escapism and reading as enrichment has long been a part of American culture, Harrington-Lueker adds. In recent years, she says she’s observed that the titles appearing on summer reading lists from The New York Times, Oprah’s Book Club and other cultural tastemakers seem less escapist than they were in previous years.\nBut from Bergeron’s perspective, plenty of readers are still looking for a respite — and this year’s offerings (she name-checked Ashley Poston’s “A Novel Love Story,” Kirsty Greenwood’s “The Love of My Afterlife” and Tia Williams’ “A Love Song for Ricki Wilde”) give them plenty of opportunities to do so.\n“Readers want to be transported,” she says. “(When you think of an) escape often you think light, but I think it’s the ability to inhabit another world or another set of shoes and just spend time in those pages.”\nAt a time when the world feels uncertain and overwhelming, Bergeron says, the beach read beckons.\n",

        "content": "Editor’s Note: This article was originally published by The Business of Fashion, an editorial partner of CNN Style.\n(CNN) — A little over a year ago, NFL player Travis Kelce stepped out in a flamboyant silk shirt emblazoned with two barrel-chest-sized pink flamingos and trimmed across the bottom with a giant Chanel logo.\nThe design was upcycled from vintage Chanel scarves by stylist Logan Horne, whose brand, J. Logan Home, specializes in refashioning heritage luxury accessories. His pieces, which retail at close to $3,000 each, have also been worn by the musicians Dua Lipa and 2 Chainz and are sold at stores including Farfetch, Kith and The Webster. They’ve also caught the attention of the French luxury giant’s legal department.\nIn February, lawyers acting for Chanel sent Horne a cease and desist letter, demanding his label stop selling products bearing its logo and other brand signifiers.\nRelated article\nCapturing the ambitious beauty of Karl Lagerfeld’s Chanel shows\nIt’s the latest in a flurry of cases that have turned upcycling into an emerging legal battle ground, pitting a practice that’s been pitched as key to improving the industry’s sustainability credentials against the established bounds of trademark protection.\n“We really have these two values that point in different directions,” said Fashion Law Institute founder Susan Scafidi. “(Upcycling) is absolutely risky, despite the fact that it is trending and ethical.”\nChanel’s objection to J. Logan Home’s designs isn’t exactly a bolt from the blue.\nMajor luxury players have historically been wary of the secondary market, concerned it could damage their carefully controlled hold on brand distribution and image, cannibalize sales and encourage counterfeiting.\nIt’s a tension that has played out prominently over the last decade thanks to the rapid rise of online resale platforms. Though some brands have begun to tentatively embrace the space, others have remained cautious. Chanel, in particular, has pursued high-profile cases against re-commerce players it argues are using its brand without permission and selling fakes.\n(The brand scored a major win earlier this year, when a New York court awarded it $4 million in damages in its suit against the resale business What Goes Around Comes Around. A separate legal dispute with The RealReal is ongoing.)\nSmaller-scale upcycling has attracted less attention so far. But the practice has become more widespread, driven in part by demand for logo-heavy streetwear, greater access to vintage products and deadstock fabrics and a growing desire among young designers to operate sustainably.\nThat’s given rise to an increasing number of trademark and copyright infringement complaints targeting upcyclers from brands including Louis Vuitton and Levi’s, as well as Chanel.\nIn 2022, Louis Vuitton secured a $603,000 pay out and permanent injunction in a Texas case against a business selling refashioned Vuitton products. Last year, Levi’s brought a complaint against French label Coperni, alleging it was using pocket stitching and fabric tabs confusingly similar to the famed denim label. The sale of such products, alongside items that had actually been upcycled from Levi’s jeans without authorization, created additional risk of consumer confusion, the company argued.\nBoth brands declined to comment when reached by Business of Fashion.\nThe disputes reflect legitimate trademark and copyright concerns, but they also raise questions over how far these protections should stretch when they conflict with broader sustainability goals, according to legal experts.\n“It is a grey area within the law,” said Scafidi. “Brands absolutely have a legal leg to stand on. The question is how well-clad it is.”\nIn general terms, once a brand has sold an item, it becomes fair game to be resold or redistributed by third parties. But this principle, known as the first-sale doctrine or trademark exhaustion, may not apply if an item has been reworked or embellished, lawyers said.\nUpcyclers can take precautions, like avoiding the prominent use of logos, or providing consumers with clear disclosures that reworked products are not authorized or affiliated with the brands they reference (an approach J. Logan Home adopted). But these steps still may not be sufficient to counter arguments of copyright or trademark infringement, according to lawyers.\nAnd while the legal frameworks protecting companies’ intellectual property are well established, whether the sustainability benefits of upcycling should be weighed against these hasn’t really been tested.\nRelated article\nSpot the ‘superfake’: Fashion brands want you to be able to identify counterfeits\n“If we want to move from a linear to a circular economy, we need to upcycle,” said Irene Calboli, a professor of law at Texas A&M University. “The fact that intellectual property law gets in the way of those who want to upcycle or recycle is just wrong.”\nChanel said it is paying close attention to sustainability matters, pointing to its work with L’Atelier des Matières, which recycles unsold items and deadstock from luxury and premium brands.\n“(Upcycling is) a positive trend that we continue to explore, and we have always been conscious of the need to strike a balance between protecting the rights of our brand and the rights of others to create and trade freely,” the company said in a statement. “However, the use of elements stamped with the Chanel logo is sometimes simply an unauthorized misappropriation of our trademarks… in such cases, we take the action we deem appropriate to protect our rights.”\nThe wider legal crackdown hasn’t only targeted brands making prominent use of logos either.\nBefore she became a celebrated New York designer, Batsheva Hay worked as a copyright lawyer. So it was a shock when she found herself on the receiving end of a cease and desist letter from a large commercial brand over a short run of dresses made from deadstock fabric sourced from India. Though it bore no obvious logo, as it turned out, the print she used had been made for a bigger player who didn’t want to see it reproduced elsewhere.\n“I was really humiliated and horrified because I thought it was some cool vintage fruit print and it turned out to be some kind of junky commercial print,” said Hay. Rather than take on the time and expense of fighting the case, she just took the remaining three dresses she hadn’t yet sold off her site.\nHorne says he can’t afford to fight Chanel, which has threatened to seek statutory damages of $2 million per mark, disgorgement of all profits and payment of its attorney’s fees if he doesn’t stop selling products carrying the company’s branding, according to a copy of the letter reviewed by Business of Fashion.\nInstead, he said he’s looking at to pivot his brand while continuing to find creative ways to address the industry’s issues with waste and over-production. The dream would be an opportunity to officially collaborate with an established label on an upcycled collection.\n“As much as I believe in my mission… I’m not trying to go bankrupt going to battle with Chanel,” he said.\nIndustry watchers say the current flurry of cases reflect a broader adjustment to emerging new models. Some big brands, like Prada, Gucci and indeed Levi’s, have already dabbled with upcycling collections and programs of their own. Anna Foster, who runs the refashioned brand E.L.V. Denim, has partnered with companies including Gabriela Hearst and The Outnet to help upcycle excess inventory. These days, she says she’s having about a conversation a week with brands interested in exploring collaboration, but the industry moves slowly.\nRelated article\nAsian rivers are turning black. And our colorful closets are to blame\nMeanwhile, politics may be moving at a faster speed, creating different challenges for brands. Both consumers and policy makers are increasingly aware of the huge levels of waste generated by the fashion industry, with new regulations that would make brands more responsible for dealing with old clothes and excess inventory in the pipeline in both Europe and the US.\n“We really are at an inflection point where we might have a result in court that is different from the result in the court of social media,” said Scafidi. “It’s that tension that really needs to be resolved.”\nThis article was originally published by The Business of Fashion, an editorial partner of CNN Style.

Your meal began with the beef consommé and proceeded to sautéed breast of chicken in wine. Care for a fruit tartlet for dessert?\nToday, if you’re flying coach, you’ll need to book a long-distance international flight or – maybe if you’re lucky – a coast-to-coast domestic one to receive a free meal. On shorter flights, you might get a choice of complementary Biscoff cookies or pretzels.\nAirplane food has fallen a long way from the glory days of in-flight dining when meals were served on white tablecloths and stewardesses scrambled eggs in the air. Disappearing meals have joined a long list of pain points, inconveniences and cutbacks that fliers endure today. But industry cost-cutting isn’t the only reason your tartlet is gone. The end of in-flight dining for many passengers surprisingly rose out of big changes in government regulation, airplane design, in-flight movies, industry tax breaks, plus heightened health and safety concerns.\nAirline safety protocols and regulations since September 11 have changed what types of cooking knives crews can work with in the air. Airplane galleys are smaller to allow for more passenger seats on a plane. And airlines don’t serve some foods, like peanuts, to protect people with allergies. Meals are often smaller, blander or non-existent.\n“Meal service was once a point of pride,” said Henry Harteveldt, who covers the travel industry for Atmosphere Research Group. Now, “the quality is so poor you have to wonder: Do airline executives actually have taste buds?”\nAirlines have long looked for ways to cut food production costs and reduce meal preparation times for flight attendants on board. In one famous example during the 1980s, Robert Crandall, then the head of American Airlines, bragged about how removing just one olive from every salad saved the airline $40,000 a year.\nCost and speed became more important to airlines than how the food tastes ever since. Carriers like Singapore Airlines or Delta may have partnerships with Michelin-starred celebrity chefs, but most companies farm out their food to catering services who may prepare it hours ahead.\n“People are willing to trade food for low fares,” said Blaise Waguespack, a professor of airline marketing at Embry‑Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida. “Your ticket gets you the seat. And anything beyond the seat you pay for.”\nCharging passengers for food on board – even just a few dollars for a sandwich, snack box or cheese plate - is also a way for airlines to save on taxes. Domestic airfares are subject to a 7.5% federal excise tax, but that tax doesn’t apply to baggage fees and on-board food, both of which are getting more expensive.\nFood on planes has been around almost a century, ever since 1920s flight attendants handed out chewing gum to passengers to relieve pressure in their ears. Early airplanes bounced so much in flight that meals were served on paper plates, according to the Smithsonian.\nFor decades, the federal government regulated airfare and routes, so airlines tried to set themselves apart with service, food and the kind of luxury usually afforded cruise passengers – or a Bond villain.\nUntil 1978, when the airline industry was deregulated, the law required that every passenger got an entrée, two vegetables, a salad, dessert and a drink as part of their ticket price, according to the Smithsonian.\n“Delicious food adds to the enjoyment. It’s prepared in four simultaneously operating galleys, where dishes can be cooked in five-minute ovens,” Pan Am advertised in a 1958 commercial.\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, airlines routinely installed sky-high kitchens on board and advertised their menus to draw customers. Beef was a business strategy.\n”Airlines competed on service and amenities. Meal service was a big focus of [competition] because entertainment options were more limited,” Harteveldt said. “Airlines would have teams of chefs, their own catering kitchens [and] advertising around food.”\nAs deregulation took hold, airlines cut ticket prices. But to make up for lost revenue, they cut back on food choices and other services as well.\nThe September 11 attacks accelerated the decline of free airline meals. Airlines faced a deep reduction in demand and slashed in-flight meal service in response. United, American Airlines, Delta and others announced sharp reductions in-flight meal service shortly after the attacks.\nThe last holdout, Continental Airlines, became the final major airline to end free domestic meals in economy class in 2010.\nAirline meals had been the brunt of jokes and criticism for decades, but now people miss them. Few airline-industry experts see them coming back anytime soon in coach.\nThe reality is very different for business and first-class passengers.\nMolly Brandt, the executive chef of culinary innovation for North America at in-flight catering company Gategroup, said that the “golden age for airline food is here.” It just depends on which airline you’re flying and category you’re in. “It’s broken down by cabin class,” she explained.\nIf you’re in first class on an American flight, for example, you may have a lunch choice of a Mediterranean bowl, chicken breast with mojo sauce, Poblano black bean rice and plantains or penne pasta with plant-based ragu and ricotta. For Delta, pick between the cheeseburger, the spinach and cheese agnolotti, or a Hempler’s smoked peppered chicken breast salad.\nA handful of airlines even offer caviar to first class passengers. But most fliers these days don’t even get the free chewing gum.\n",

        "content": "McDonald’s and other fast food chains are charging more. So much so that you may want to consider going for a slightly slower burger. Or at least, that’s what Applebee’s wants you to think about.\n“You can get our burger for $9.99,” John Peyton, CEO of Applebee’s parent company Dine Brands, told CNN in an interview. With that in mind, “why would you take a $10 burger … that you can eat in a bag out of your car?”\nIf Peyton’s sales pitch resonates with customers, it could help convince diners to eat at sit-down restaurants, something they might otherwise see as an indulgence.\nFor a while, restaurant customers were trading down — swapping out expensive meals for cheaper ones, but still dining out. Now, some are responding to higher menu prices by trading out entirely: Instead of opting for cheaper restaurants or meals, they’re eating more at home and spending less when they do go out.\nThat means that restaurants have to battle it out for these cost-conscious consumers. And now, it’s not just burger chain against burger chain.\nRelated article\nRestaurants are competing for frugal diners’ dollars\nBecause fast food joints have been hiking up prices in recent years, dine-in spots like Applebee’s can run promotions that end up costing about the same as a fast food lunch — giving them a chance to try to steal those customers away.\nThe overlap offers “a new opportunity,” according to Peyton. Lunch at McDonald’s now costs about the same as lunch at Applebee’s, where you can sit at a table and have your meal delivered by a server. Pointing that out is a new way to bid for customers.\nApplebee’s, which has seen sales slump as lower-income customers pull back, is offering deals and hoping the prices will speak for themselves. Chili’s, on the other hand, is making the comparison more explicit.\nFor them, and the fast food chains they’re now competing against, the stakes are high.\nYears of price hikes have contributed to declining traffic, pushing restaurants to fight over fewer customers, according to David Henkes, a senior principal at Technomic, a food industry research and consulting firm.\n“It’s a smaller pie today than it was a year ago,” he said. “You’re competing for a share of a smaller market. And so it is more competitive.”\nFast food prices, in particular, have shot up. “Fast food has gotten really expensive,” Henkes said. “Certainly, relative to where it was 12 to 18 months ago, and also in comparison to casual dining sit-down restaurants right now.”\nIn the 12 months through March, not adjusting for seasonal swings, prices at fast food and fast casual restaurants went up 5%, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In that period full-service menu prices went up 3.2%, and grocery prices ticked up 1.2%.\nA few years ago, McDonald’s said that it could raise prices without losing too many customers. But now, it’s struggling with lower-income customers.\nRelated article\nWhat went wrong at Red Lobster\nCEO Chris Kempczinski said during a February analyst call that “the battle ground is certainly with that low-income consumer.” The following month, CFO Ian Borden conceded during another analyst call that “it’s a challenging consumer environment.”\nThe chain is working on a $5 menu to win over those customers, according to Bloomberg.\nThings aren’t much better over at Applebee’s.\nSales at US Applebee’s locations open at least a year slumped 4.6% in the first quarter. In that period, customers who earn $50,000 a year or less visited less often, and spent less when they did, Peyton said, adding that the demographic makes up about 45% of Applebee’s customers.\n“For several quarters… we’ve been asking ourselves, when will we see the impact of inflation, and the economy in general, and interest rates, on on our guest,” he said. “We really began to see it in the first quarter.”\nHe added that “we think it’s going to be a fight for share of wallet and market share all year.”\nWith fast food prices high, sit-down restaurants can make a case for themselves.\nPeople have taken their fast food price grievances to social channels, some complaining about the price of McDonald’s burgers and hash browns. Chili’s has been paying attention.\n“Our social media team has been watching the conversation that the consumer is frustrated by fast food prices,” said Kevin Hochman, president of Chili’s and CEO of its parent company, Brinker International, during an April analyst call. In response, Chili’s decided to run ads that “use fast food as a foil,” he said.\nThe chain said in an April press release that it was adding a new burger — which it described as having “twice the beef of a Big Mac and flavors fast food lovers will recognize” — to its ‘3 for me’ value menu. For $10.99, customers get the burger plus an app and a drink.\nOn X, Chili’s asked whether Chili’s is better than fast food, and promised rewards to those who said yes. Chili’s also ran video ads comparing its food favorably to fast food burgers.\nBut it might not be that easy. Getting people to go to Chili’s instead of McDonald’s may be a stretch, said Henkes.\nOne problem for chains like Chili’s and Applebee’s is that they’re not so much competing on price, as they are on time.\n“People go to sit-down restaurants, generally speaking, for different occasions, than they go to fast food restaurants,” Henkes noted. You might expect to spend an hour at a Chili’s or an Applebee’s, and breeze right through a McDonald’s.\nStill, campaigns like Chili’s can help communicate to customers that these days its food is relatively cheap.\n“Planting that seed that, ‘Hey, we’re a good value,’ I think is a good message to have,” Henkes said.\n",

        "content": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.\nA Chinese tech executive has ignited outrage in China with her fiery endorsement of toxic workplace culture, which eventually caused her to lose her own job.\nQu Jing, the former vice president and head of communications at Baidu, often dubbed China’s equivalent to Google, sparked a public relations crisis for the Chinese search engine after her controversial comments hit a raw nerve with young workers fed up with grueling hours and relentless pressure.\nIn a series of short videos posted last week on Douyin, China’s version of TikTok, Qu spoke about her devotion to her career, strict management style and unflagging demands on her direct reports.\nIn one video, she lashed out at an employee who refused to go on a 50-day business trip during the Covid-19 pandemic, when China imposed stringent travel restrictions and quarantines.\n“Why should I take my employee’s family into consideration? I’m not her mother-in-law,” Qu said. “I’m 10 years, 20 years older than you. I didn’t feel bitter about it or tired, even though I have two children. Who are you to tell me that your husband can’t stand it?”\nIn another clip, Qu shared her personal sacrifices as a working mother. She was working so hard that she forgot her elder son’s birthday and what grade her younger son was in at school. She said she didn’t regret it because she “chose to become a career woman.”\n“If you work in public relations, don’t expect weekends off,” she said in a third video. “Keep your phone on 24 hours a day, always ready to respond.”\nIn another video, she also threatened to retaliate against employees who complain about her, saying they wouldn’t get another job in the industry.\nThe American Psychological Association describes “toxic workplace” as an environment filled with infighting, intimidation and other affronts that harm productivity.\nFollowing the public outcry, Qu has lost her own job at Baidu (BIDU), a person familiar with the matter told CNN on condition of anonymity. CNN has also seen a screenshot of an internal personnel system that appears to confirm she no longer works at the company.\nBaidu did not immediately respond to a request for comment. By Thursday night, Qu had removed the title of “Baidu’s vice president” from her account on Douyin.\nQu had apologized earlier in the day and said her posts did not speak for Baidu.\nThe controversy soon became a trending topic on Douyin and Weibo, China’s X-like platform, dominating online discussions. Users criticized Qu for her aggressive and insensitive approach and accused her, and Baidu, of promoting a toxic workplace.\n“In her voice and in her tone, there’s deep indifference to and lack of empathy for the common plight of her colleagues,” said Ivy Yang, a China tech analyst and founder of consulting firm Wavelet Strategy.\n“A lot of what she said really struck a nerve, because people feel that in their own workplaces very often. The fact that she said it in a way that’s so direct and in your face, it just generated this kind of emotional response,” she said.\n“This is what the bosses are thinking, and she was merely saying it out aloud,” Yang added.\nChina’s young workers have increasingly spoken out against the culture of excessive overwork and extreme competitiveness that has come to dominate many industries, especially the tech sector.\nIn 2019, Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma drew intense criticism after endorsing the “996” trend, meaning working from 9am to 9pm six days a week, and calling it a “huge blessing.”\nYang called the backlash against Ma a “watershed moment” that led people to rethink the relationship between the workplace and themselves — a trend that has only intensified as the Chinese economy slows.\nChina’s economy grew stronger than expected at the start of this year, but problems — including a property crisis, declining foreign investment and tepid consumption — are piling up.\n“When companies demand complete loyalty, time and energy from their employees, employees feel there’s no reciprocity or reward for their sacrifice or contribution, especially when things are slowing down. That becomes the central conflict, and this conflict is also at the heart of the Baidu saga,” Yang added.\nAs public anger mounted, the videos posted on Qu’s personal Douyin account were taken down.\nAfter days of silence, Qu apologized on Thursday for “causing such a big storm” in a post on her personal account on WeChat, China’s most popular social media app.\n“I have carefully read all the opinions and comments from various platforms, and many criticisms are very pertinent. I deeply reflect on and humbly accept them,” Qu wrote.\nShe also sought to put distance between her remarks and Baidu, saying she had not sought approval beforehand and that they did not represent the company’s stance.\n“There were many inappropriate and unsuitable points made in the videos, which led to misunderstandings about the company’s values and culture, causing serious harm,” Qu wrote.\nA person familiar with the matter said Qu’s clips were part of her push to amplify Baidu’s voice on short video platforms, which have become an increasingly important channel for information dissemination in China.\nRelated article\nLabor Day isn’t the holiday it once was for China’s workers\nQu had asked all members of the PR team to create their personal accounts, according to the person, who requested anonymity.\n“The main purpose is to improve everyone’s ability to make short videos. Everyone can have different options over the content, and Cristina chose to speak about her personal experience,” said the person, referring to Qu’s English name.\nQu worked as a reporter for China’s state news agency Xinhua before switching to the PR industry. She joined Baidu in 2021 from Huawei, a Chinese tech giant known for its hard-charging “wolf culture,” where employees are expected to emulate wolves’ bloodthirsty nature, fearlessness and resilience.\nRen Zhengfei, the founder of Huawei, has previously said in interviews that its corporate culture was misunderstood. “Wolf culture,” he has said, meant “sensitivity, team spirit and resilience” and that the company didn’t have a “996 culture.”\nA former Baidu employee said Qu brought Huawei’s “aggressive” corporate culture with her to Baidu.\n“(She triggered) a pretty big culture shock. About 60% of the team left within months of her arrival,” the former employee told CNN on the condition of anonymity.\nThe PR team is expected to always be available, keep their phones on, reply to messages immediately and attend meetings at midnight and on weekends with short notice, the former employee said.\nQu also adopted the military-style language used in corporate management at Huawei, requiring the team to be “disciplined” and “able to win battles,” the former employee said.\nCNN has reached out to Huawei for comment.\nThis article has been updated with additional information.\n",

        "content": "A federal judge in Fort Worth, Texas, on Friday blocked a new Biden administration rule that would prohibit credit card companies from charging customers late fees higher than $8.\nUS District Judge Mark T. Pittman, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, granted a preliminary injunction to several business and banking organizations that allege the new rule violates several federal statutes.\nThese organizations, led by the right-leaning US Chamber of Commerce, sued the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after the rule was finalized in March. The rule, which was set to go into effect Tuesday, would save consumers about $10 billion per year by cutting fees from an average of $32, the CFPB estimated.\nA preliminary injunction means the rule can’t go into effect until a hearing is held where the case can be adjudicated in greater detail.\n“The credit card lobby’s lawsuit is an attempt to derail a rule that will save families $10 billion each year in order to continue making tens of billions of dollars in profits by charging borrowers late fees that far exceed their actual costs,” a CFPB spokesperson told CNN in a statement. “Consumers will shoulder $800 million in late fees every month that the rule is delayed — money that pads the profit margins of the largest credit card issuers. We will continue to defend this rule so that working families can stop paying excessive late fees that Congress banned more than a decade ago.”\nMaria Monaghan, the counsel for the US Chamber of Commerce Litigation Center, said in a statement Friday that the ruling was “a major win for responsible consumers who pay their credit card bills on time and businesses that want to provide affordable credit,” and that it would “continue to hold the CFPB accountable in court.”\n“It is disappointing that the court has granted this last-ditch effort by the banks to prevent these critical limits on credit card late fees from going into effect next week,” said Chuck Bell, advocacy program director for non-profit Consumer Reports. “Credit card companies have been bilking consumers out of billions of dollars in excessive late fees for far too long.”\nThe rule, first proposed in February 2023, is part of a broader push by the Biden administration to eliminate “junk fees,” considered hidden or misleading charges to consumers.\nThe new rule would apply to large credit card issuers — those with more than 1 million accounts. These companies represent more than 95% of total outstanding credit card debt, according to the CFPB.\nThe push to target credit card fees is part of the Biden administration’s efforts to ease financial burdens for many Americans. Some borrowers, especially millennials and those with lower incomes, have fallen behind on their credit card debt following more than two years of high inflation.\nThe new rule also intended to close a 2010 loophole the CFPB says has been “exploited” by credit card companies to hike fees on late payments.\nAccording to a national Consumer Reports survey published in September, one in five American adults said they had paid a credit card late fee in the previous 12 months. Eighty-two percent said they supported lowering the maximum late fee.\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\nCNN’s Matt Egan contributed to this report.\n",

        "content": "Florida A&M University is putting a purported $237.75 million donation “on pause,” after media reports and college board leaders raised concerns about the actual value of the stock gift—and the details surrounding the donor’s previous donations.\n“A decision that was made yesterday to put a pause on this activity—a hold, is more or less, is the language that was used—pending some additional information that has come to my attention,” FAMU President Larry Robinson said Thursday during an emergency school board meeting, called after media reports and school leaders raised concerns about the legitimacy of the gift.\nIt’s a stunning reversal from the fanfare last Saturday at FAMU’s commencement ceremony, when the announcement of the gift made headlines as one of the largest ever personal donations ever to a historically Black college or university.\nGregory Gerami, the 30-year-old CEO of Texas hydroponic hemp farm company Batterson Farms Corp., presented the $237.75 million stock gift via an oversized, ceremonial check to university administration members including Robinson, who called the gift “breathtaking in its generosity and its scope” via a press release the day of the donation.\nBut the jubilance quickly gave way to skepticism.\nA report from Politico noted Batterson Farms Corp. is a comparatively small company, and that its private shares are unlikely to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\nIn 2020, a notable deal involving a donor later identified as Gerami fell apart. South Carolina’s Coastal Carolina University had announced a $95 million donation from an anonymous donor, who then backed out months later. An investigation by the Myrtle Beach Sun News identified Gerami in a story that noted, among other details, that he backed out alleging racism from CCU officials—an allegation they denied.\nAt an emergency board meeting on Thursday, FAMU board of trustee and foundation members expressed their concerns and frustration about the school’s vetting process involving Gerami’s donation.\nSeveral members of the FAMU Foundation Board of Directors and Deveron Gibbons, the vice chair of the university’s Board of Trustees, said they were not informed of the donation until it was announced at commencement.\n“This meeting is taking place because no one, as I am aware of from this conversation, had any clue this was going on,” Gibbons told CNN. “We are talking about a transformational, largest in HBCU history donation: big check on stage, with press involved and big PR campaign push after the fact. If that doesn’t show that we need to take a step back and get our own house in order, I don’t know what else does.”\nGibbons has called for an independent investigation into the transaction.\n“I hope that this is a good gift. It could be transformative for the university and much needed. But we must vet the process, doing an announcement is not the first thing you do … Vet the individual. You vet the donation,” Vice Chair Gibbons said.\nBoard Chair Kristin Harper provided a statement to CNN on Friday saying, “Serious concerns have been raised regarding the validity of the gift, the adequacy of the due diligence processes and whether the Foundation Board and Board of Trustees have been provided ample oversight opportunity.”\n“I regrettably share these concerns” Harper added.\nOn May 5, just one day after the announcement at commencement, FAMU released a statement via X (formerly Twitter) insisting the university had done its “due diligence.” The statement went on to say that Gerami had transferred $237,750,000 of stocks into a FAMU account last month.\nA non-disclosure agreement requested by Gerami prohibited officials from disclosing the details to either the university’s board of trustees or the board of directors, Vice President for University Advancement Shawnta Friday-Stroud said during an emergency meeting Thursday.\n“In addition to the wealth screening that was done at the beginning, we did a more expansive screening of Mr. Gerami’s background,” Friday-Stroud said.\n“We had a discussion with Dr. Robinson, all of which has been put out on social media. We said, ‘ok, we will proceed with the decision to move forward,” Friday-Stroud added.\n“My concern is our reputation has been greatly impacted and I want to make sure that we restore faith in our alumni and all of the friends and family that support Florida A&M University,” said FAMU Foundation Board member Terry Arnold.\nWhen reached by CNN on Thursday, Gerami declined immediate comment.  He referred questions to the university and agreed to answer CNN’s questions on the following day, but he couldn’t be reached.\nFAMU’s Special Board of Trustees, which oversees the full school and the foundation, has scheduled a meeting for May 15 to discuss the donation.\nFAMU’s communications department did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on more detailed questions about the gift and the nature of the vetting process.\n",

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.\nA couple of weeks ago, I rewatched Jurassic Park for probably the 10th time since the movie came out 30 years ago. (As an aside, it really holds up — 10/10, no notes.)\nEarly in the plot, when the guests are discussing their impressions of the park, Jeff Goldblum’s character (also 10/10, just perfect) launches into a speech so prescient you could sub out all the dinosaur stuff and map it onto the modern debate around artificial intelligence.\n“Don’t you see the danger, John, inherent in what you’re doing here? Genetic power is the most awesome force the planet’s ever seen, but you wield it like a kid that’s found his dad’s gun … You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could, and before you even knew what you had, you patented it, and packaged it, and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox, and now you’re selling it.”\nAnd then comes the line that later launched a thousand memes: “Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn’t stop to think if they should.”\nNaturally, the skeptic of the group is dismissed as a Luddite and the movie carries on. (Spoiler alert: The Luddite was right!)\nAI skeptics — who are legion, and not necessarily part of the fringe tin foil hat crowd — are begging Silicon Valley to take a beat before unleashing AI to the world.\nBut tech companies, faced with the most powerful computing innovation in a generation, are running around like kids who just found their dad’s gun.\nSee here: Apple and Google — which, to be sure, deserve a lot of credit for the innovations they’ve brought to the world — have recently latched on to AI-powered features to help sell their newest tablets and smartphones. After all, throwing AI into your pitch deck is a surefire way to signal to shareholders that you’re on the cutting edge, which helps distract from the fact that your company hasn’t actually produced any significant proprietary tech in years.\nIn marketing those new devices, though, Apple and Google have lost the plot.\nApple’s new iPad advertisement made headlines for all the wrong reasons this week. The spot depicts a massive industrial hydraulic press slowly crushing a collection of objects that represent the human creative experience: There’s a piano, a record player blasting Sonny & Cher’s 1972 hit “All I Ever Need Is You,” cans of paint, books, a Space Invaders arcade console, a trumpet. The music bounces along as the machine switches on and smashes it all down. Then, the big reveal: It’s all contained in Apple’s new iPad, its thinnest and most powerful ever, thanks to its brand new AI chip.\nThe outrage online came fast and furious.\n“It is the most honest metaphor for what tech companies do to … artists, musicians, creators, writers, filmmakers: squeeze them, use them, not pay well, take everything then say it’s all created by them,” filmmaker Asif Kapadia wrote on X.\n“If you thought THIS IPad ad was weird, you should have seen the first cut where they lined up all your favorite characters and shot them,” quipped actor and producer Luke Barnett.\nApple issued a rare apology for the ad on Thursday, telling AdAge that “our goal is to always celebrate the myriad of ways users express themselves and bring their ideas to life through iPad. We missed the mark with this video, and we’re sorry.”\nEarlier in the week, CEO Tim Cook said Apple’s “outrageously powerful” M4 chip will power the company’s new AI tools. In other words: Check it out, Wall Street! People aren’t buying our stuff as much any more but just wait until we add bots!\nMeanwhile, is anyone else getting inundated with Google’s Pixel ads, which show people giddily using the smartphone’s AI photo-editing software to deceive their online followers?\nIn those ads, a guy who can’t dunk a basketball on his own uses a trampoline to get to the rim, and then edits out the trampoline. An imperfect group selfie gets everyone’s best angle and creates a composite image of a moment that never happened. A dad tosses his kid up playfully in the air, and then edits the image to seem, for reasons I still don’t understand, as if the kid went several inches higher into the air.\nThis is Google going, “look what we can do!” without any reflection on how pointless it all is. It is, at best, distortion for distortion’s sake. At worst, it’s distortion for the sake of conditioning regular people to be cool with the idea of visual misinformation.\nSmartphones and tablets were invented to enhance our lived experience, to make it easier to leave the house and go to the beach and meet up with friends — just a good camera-computer combo that fits in your pocket.\nTheoretically, our phones and tablets will become even more useful with AI, serving as virtual assistants that can do all the boring stuff we don’t want to, like summarizing all your new emails and filtering out junk. There’s a world in the not too distant future, according to AI proponents, where you can simply tell Siri or Google “order my usual breakfast from the coffee shop near the office, I’ll be there in 10 minutes to pick it up,” and the bot will do just that.\nWe’re not there yet, however. And so far, the consumer applications for AI are simultaneously underwhelming and dystopian.\nDistorted images may be harmless social media fodder, until they become propaganda spread by bad actors.\nApple is expected to announce its own ChatGPT-like tools that could be a game changer for your internet searches. But generative AI bots are also prone to give wrong answers and experience hallucinations, and no one seems to know what happens when the bots run out of human-generated data to learn from and start hoovering up their own artificial texts like a snake eating its own tail.\nThe Jeff Goldblums of the AI debate — who include some of the industry’s own pioneers — are not necessarily saying we have to smother AI and pretend it never existed. Most of them are just your friendly neighborhood skeptic, walking around going, “hey, should we really do that?”\nClearly, we weren’t invited to Apple’s or Google’s marketing meetings.\n",

        "content": "Nine hours and 30 minutes ahead of New York. Five hours and 30 minutes ahead of London. Three hours and 30 minutes behind Tokyo.\nFor more than a century, India’s clocks have officially fallen short of the full hour in calculating any time difference it has with most countries.\nAnd while it is part of a small group of nations and territories that shares that 30-minute gap - including Iran, Myanmar and parts of Australia - India is perhaps the most unlikely outlier.\nThe huge South Asian nation geographically spans what would normally be two time zones, but much to the frustration of some groups, it clings to its unusual clock settings, refusing to part ways with a system that has a very complicated past.\nIndia’s half-hour zone dates back to colonial rule of India and the era when ever-faster steamships and trains were shrinking the world.\nUntil the 19th century, India - like most places around the world - operated on very localized times, which were often different not just from city to city, but from village to village. But playing a key role in the background was East India Company, a ruthless and powerful British-owned trading organization that gradually seized control of large parts of the subcontinent.\nThe East India Company was managing the one of Asia’s first observatories, in Madras (now known as Chennai) by 1792. A decade later, the first official astronomer at this observatory declared Madras time to be “the basis of Indian Standard Time.”\nIt took a few decades, the advent of steam-powered locomotives and the commercial interests of the East India Company to make that stick, though.\n“The railroads had immense sway over the colonial powers,” says Geoff Gordon, a senior researcher in public international law at the University of Amsterdam.\n“Before the railroads won the contest for Madras time, there was a contest among the powerful cities – Bombay, Kolkata,” adds Gordon. “That fight didn’t last long.”\nMeanwhile, similar debates around the world, driven by the need to better coordinate transcontinental rail travel and improve maritime navigation, led to the establishment of the first international time zones at a conference in Washington D.C. in 1884.\nThe zones were based around the Greenwich Meridian, a line of longitude that runs north-south through the Greenwich Observatory in London. Time zones to the east of the Meridian are typically later than Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) in hourly increments.\nIt took a while for the system to be adopted globally. In India, people were still arguing over Madras Time. Despite the time’s adoption by the country’s railways, it faced considerable opposition from workers and local communities unwilling to have rigid new timings imposed on them.\n“There’s less room to maneuver as your working rhythms are linked up no longer with your boss down the street, the church bell, and the 20 other people that you go to work with,” says Gordon. “But it’s now determined by the railroad that arrives once a day.”\nEventually, Madras Time was established nationwide by 1905, with only a few remaining holdouts.\nThe start of the 20th century saw some push from scientific associations to calibrate India’s time to GMT.\nThe Royal Society in London proposed two time zones for India, both in full-hour increments from GMT and one another: Six hours ahead of GMT for the east and five hours for the west of the country.\nThat recommendation was rejected by the colonial government, which opted for a unified time that sat squarely in the middle: five and a half hours ahead of GMT.\n“It strikes me as sort of typical of the colonial mindset,” says Gordon.\nAnd so, in 1906, India’s British rulers introduced what is now known as Indian Standard Time.\nWhile the 30-minute difference is a lingering remnant of India’s colonial past, some countries have changed their own time zones more recently.\nVenezuela’s former president Hugo Chávez set clocks back by half an hour in 2007 to give schoolchildren more daylight time, a move that was later reversed by current leader Nicolas Maduro.\nIn 2015, North Korea moved out of sync with South Korea by creating “Pyongyang Time,” putting the country eight and a half hours ahead of GMT instead of nine.\nIndia’s colonial-era time zone decision making, however, reflected a chorus of political, scientific and commercial voices both from within the government and outside of it, Gordon says.\nHe compares India during this period to “Brazil,” the 1985 dark dystopian sci-fi fantasy film directed by Terry Gilliam, or the comically complicated contraptions drawn by US cartoonist Rube Goldberg.\n“It’s just this unbelievably haphazard Rube Goldberg-esque construction, that is built up through lots of different inputs, lots of people acting opportunistically, lots of people acting naively,” he adds. “There was a lot of weirdness and wildness.”\nIndia’s single time-zone has been the subject of much debate over the years, with populations in the northeast demanding a separate time zone given how wide the country is.\nThough this problem isn’t unique to India: geographically, China is the third largest in the world and still only has one time zone, which a 2014 study argues is symbolic of the state’s centralized control over people’s everyday lives.\nIndia’s official timekeepers, the National Physical Laboratory, even called for two separate time zones on account of this issue, citing reports of India’s time “badly affecting” the lives of people in the northeast.\nIt proposed two time zones instead: five and a half hours ahead of GMT for one side of India, and six and a half hours for another, specifically what they’ve described as “extreme northeast regions,” including areas like Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.\n“Despite geographical differences—such as the sun rising and setting nearly two hours earlier in the northeast compared to Gujarat—both regions adhere to the same time-zone,” says Maulik Jagnani, an assistant professor of economics at Tufts University.\nJagnani published a widely cited paper in 2019 highlighting the impact of sunlight on natural circadian rhythms in India, with a focus on children.\n“This setup affects children’s sleep patterns […] children exposed to later sunsets go to bed later,” adds Jagnani. “Fixed school and work start times do not allow for corresponding adjustments in wake-up times, leading to reduced sleep and poorer educational outcomes.”\nThe NPL also recognized this issue, adding that the circadian rhythm’s impact on health and work efficiency, is tied to the “overall socio-economic development of the region.”\nHowever, it looks like India’s unusual time zone is here to stay. When the question of introducing two time zones was put to India’s parliament in 2019, a government committee rejected the concept over unspecified “strategic reasons.”\n",

        "content": "Amelia Showalter was debating whether asking a stranger to join her on a ghost tour was a mad idea.\nShe was sitting in a crowded bar in Edinburgh’s Old Town, the last dregs of a glass of Scottish whisky in front of her.\nAlso in front of her: Lucas Demaria. An Argentinian DJ she’d just met. He was a fellow Edinburgh tourist and a self-confessed “big nerd.” And he was someone Amelia was “very much liking talking with”\nAmelia swallowed the last of her whisky, and in turn swallowed her reservations. She wanted to carry on her conversation with Lucas. And she was in a city she’d never visited before. If he said no, it didn’t matter. What did she have to lose?\n“I’m heading on this ghost tour soon,” Amelia said. “Do you want to come? It’s supposed to be spooky.”\nLucas raised his eyebrow.\n“Not that I actually believe in ghosts,” Amelia added quickly.\n“Sure,” said Lucas, laughing. “Why not.”\nThe next thing they knew, Amelia and Lucas were walking, shoulder to shoulder, down Edinburgh’s cobbled streets. Dusk was falling and the city, with its stone spired buildings and hills and crags in the distance, had a dreamy atmosphere.\nThe ghost tour focused on the city’s bloody history, with the guide recounting the chilling tale of grave robbers Burke and Hare, stories of plague and taking the group into Edinburgh’s eerie Blair Street underground vaults, a series of abandoned chambers beneath the city’s South Bridge.\n“You’d think it wouldn’t be very romantic,” Amelia tells CNN Travel today. “But it was, because you’re kind of pretending to be scared.”\nAmelia and Lucas stood closer and closer as the tour progressed. Their hands brushed against each other, but didn’t quite touch.\nAnd then, tour over, the two ducked into a bar. They sat together, drinking and chatting into the night.\n“And at some point I was like, ‘We should make out,’” says Amelia.\n“And I was like, ‘Yes,’” says Lucas, laughing.\n“I feel like at that point we were both like, ‘Come on, we’re going to kiss,’” says Amelia.\n“It was going that way for sure,” says Lucas.\nAmelia and Lucas went on the spontaneous ghost tour on June 4, 2018, which just so happened to be Amelia’s 35th birthday.\nBack then, Amelia lived and worked in Washington D.C., running a political data consultancy. She’d previously worked on President Barack Obama’s campaign in 2012.\nFrom time to time, Amelia’s work led to interesting travel opportunities – and that’s how she ended up visiting the UK in June 2018. She got invited to speak at a conference in London, and decided to tack on some extra days exploring the UK.\n“I was like, ‘Well, if I’m going to be sort of traveling on my own, when I turn 35, I should do something fun – I should go celebrate somehow,’” says Amelia.\nAmelia decided to attend a “Game of Thrones” convention in Manchester in the north of England (“I love sci-fi, fantasy, all that stuff,” she says). Then she headed up to Scotland to squeeze in a day of solo travel in Edinburgh.\n“I just had the one day there,” recalls Amelia. “So I went to the National Museum of Scotland. I ate some haggis. And then I wanted to have some Scotch.”\nAmelia figured it would be fitting to sample a 35-year-old Scottish whisky on the day of her 35th birthday. She Googled Edinburgh’s best whisky bars and the internet suggested Edinburgh institution Bow Bar, situated on the city’s colorful, winding Victoria Street. Amelia headed in that direction, pushed open the blue door and grabbed a seat at the bar.\nShe’d just started sipping her drink when she spotted Lucas. He caught her eye because he was – unlike almost everyone else inside Bow Bar– drinking a beer.\n“I just thought it was so strange that this person was drinking a beer in a whisky bar,” says Amelia. “I really wanted to know, ‘What beer is so good that you’re doing that instead of drinking some whisky?’”\nWithout really thinking twice, Amelia turned to the stranger and asked the question.\nIn June 2018, Lucas Demaria was 36 and starting to “give up on trying to find the one,” as he puts it.\nDisillusioned with romance, Lucas decided to focus on exploring the world.\n“I started traveling late in my life,” Lucas tells CNN Travel. “And it just blew my mind.”\nHe arrived in Edinburgh for the first time on the morning of June 4, 2018. He’d heard the city was scenic, but he couldn’t quite believe how spectacular it really was.\n“I made it there and was like, ‘Oh my God, this is a beautiful city,’” recalls Lucas. “I had in my mind eating haggis, so I dropped the bag in the hostel, started walking, ate haggis, and then I told myself, ‘Okay, I need to drink some scotch’ But I’m very into beer. And I know really nothing about scotch.”\nLucas stumbled across the Bow Bar while wandering around on foot. It looked like the place to go to satisfy his whisky quest. But once inside, the range of options was pretty intimidating. Lucas stared at the bottles, mystified. In the end he ordered a beer to enjoy while he mulled over the whisky options.\nWhen Amelia struck up conversation, questioning his drink choice, Lucas told her a truncated version of this explanation. He’d actually been debating how to strike up conversation with Amelia before she got in there first – he’d noticed her almost right away: “Sitting at the end of the bar, a beautiful lady,” as he recalls it.\nDrink orders explained, the conversation moved on. Lucas was wearing a “Star Wars” T-shirt, and Amelia commented on it, saying she was also a fan.\n“I showed her my ‘Star Wars’ tattoos,” says Lucas.\nAt the time, Amelia was into cosplay – recreating and wearing the costumes of fictional characters. So after she’d admired the tattoos, she got out her phone, and showed Lucas some photos of her hand-sewn “Star Wars” costumes.\n“It was a nerd meeting,” says Lucas, laughing.\nFrom there, the two talked a bit about their impressions of the UK, realizing along the way that they shared the same favorite British band: The Beatles.\nThe conversation flowed in a way that surprised them both – neither Lucas or Amelia usually spoke to strangers in bars.\n“It’s not in my nature,” says Lucas. “But I would do that while traveling.”\n“Yeah, I would never just go start talking to a random person in a bar in D.C., which is where I lived at the time,” agrees Amelia. “But when I travel, I’m just a much more open-minded person.”\nIt was this outlook that prompted Amelia to invite Lucas to join her on the ghost tour – and prompted Lucas to say yes.\nAfter the evening of whisky drinking, ghost stories and growing closer, Amelia and Lucas had to say their goodbyes. Amelia was heading down to London for her conference, while Lucas still had a few more days exploring Edinburgh. The two exchanged contact details, and started communicating via messaging app WhatsApp.\n“First it was just text, for a couple of weeks, with some photos,” recalls Amelia.\nAnd then, one day when she was back home in Washington D.C., Amelia saw a voice recording from Lucas pop up on her phone.\nVoice notes are pretty commonplace in the US now, but in 2018, Amelia had never come across the concept. In contrast, Lucas regularly sent voice notes to his friends in Argentina.\nAmelia clicked play, and Lucas’ voice echoed around her bedroom. Her heart started racing.\n“To hear his voice and everything, I was just so excited,” she recalls. “And it made me realize, ‘Oh, I really like this guy.’ Because when I was hearing his voice again, it was just so wonderful.”\nBefore long, Amelia and Lucas were video calling regularly.\n“We’d be talking for an hour, a couple of hours,” recalls Amelia.\n“Several times a week,” says Lucas.\nRelated article\nThey fell in love on vacation but went their separate ways. Four years later, she sent him an email: ‘Remember me?’\nAmelia’s a data scientist by trade, and even while caught up in the heady emotions of falling for Lucas, she tried to think things through logically.\n“When we met, I started making a little spreadsheet of how certain I felt that he was the love of my life,” recalls Amelia.\n“I wasn’t being overly romantic – the first entry was 10% – a 10% chance Lucas was the love of my life. Which is actually really high if you think about it, just because what are the odds that any person is the love of your life?”\nAs she spent more and more time WhatsApping Lucas, Amelia added more data to the spreadsheet.\n“It went up to 20%,” she says. “I kept plotting it out.”\nBut Amelia knew the only way of securing a higher score would be to see Lucas again. The prospect had been raised on their video calls – but they had to figure out the logistics.\nLucas’ DJ job was always busier during his Argentinian summer months, starting November through to January. If he was going to embark on another vacation, it needed to be before then.\nAmelia considered visiting Lucas, and Lucas debated visiting Amelia, but ultimately the two decided meeting in a third country was the best plan.\n“So in October of 2018, we scheduled a 10-day trip to Peru together,” recalls Amelia. “Our second date.”\nOn their respective flights to Peru, Amelia and Lucas played back their months of video conversations in their head. They were both excited, but also apprehensive.\n“I think my biggest fear, going to Peru, was, ‘What if I get there, and all of a sudden, it just feels wrong? Like I’ve built this whole thing up in my head,’” recalls Amelia. “Because you can kind of do that with long distance.”\nBut as soon as Amelia saw Lucas, her fears dissolved.\n“Immediately, I was like, ‘Oh, no, this is great,’” Amelia says. “Within the first two days, when we were walking around Lima, it was like, ‘This feels really serious.’ And it felt good.”\nIn between hiking the Inca Trail, marveling at Machu Picchu and eating mountains of delicious Peruvian food, Amelia and Lucas started talking about marriage.\n“By the end of the trip, we were not exactly engaged. But we were sort of engaged to be engaged,” says Amelia.\nShe updated her spreadsheet: the percentage was steadily climbing.\nThe idea of marrying someone you’d only met twice seemed bizarre, but both Amelia and Lucas felt calm and excited when they considered their future together – with just a dash of surprise at the whole thing. After all, their lives were taking a direction neither of them had anticipated – it was a happy shift, but a shift all the same.\n“I never thought about getting married either until I met her, basically,” says Lucas.\nAmelia echoes this.\n“I had really gotten fine with the idea of being single,” she says. “I was like, ‘Well, maybe I’m just going to be one of those people that doesn’t meet anybody. And that’s okay. I’m just going to have a life on my own.’”\nThe future suddenly looked very different for both of them.\nIn February 2019, Lucas came to D.C. to visit Amelia. He met her parents, friends and loved ones. Not long after, Amelia visited Lucas in Argentina.\nIt was during that trip that the couple officially got engaged. They picked out the ring together, making official something both of them knew was on the cards from pretty much day one.\nExplaining this feeling to loved ones was sometimes a little “strange,” says Amelia. She recalls saying: “I met this guy in Scotland, but he’s from Argentina. And I think we might get married” and fielding disbelieving responses, and some concerns.\n“It was just definitely a strange thing to explain to people,” Amelia reflects today. “But I think also, it’s such a different thing when you’re in your 30s – because you know yourself better. I think it would be ill advised to do that when you’re 20, because you don’t really know yourself and it’s easy to get kind of caught up. But I think after 15, 20 years of dating, you know yourself – and you have had enough other relationships to know what doesn’t work.”\nRelated article\nShe swore she’d never get married. Then, she traveled to London and a surprise meeting changed her mind\nAmelia and Lucas were married at a small courthouse ceremony in Washington D.C. in the summer of 2019. Then, four months later, the couple threw a big D.C. celebration for family and friends.\nAs a DJ, Lucas had worked hundreds of weddings. He’d seen stuff he liked, stuff he didn’t like – and all in all, knew what added up to a great evening. Amelia was on the same page. The couple wanted the evening to feel like, “a night at the bar with all your friends,” as Amelia puts it.\nAmelia and Lucas rented a cafe-bar called Emissary in D.C. for the evening.\n“We had endless appetizers,” recalls Amelia. “So there wasn’t a sit down dinner. It was just food whenever you want, open bar, with all the usual stuff that’s on the menu, and espresso when you want because it was also a cafe.”\nLucas mixed the music in advance, while Amelia made her own wedding dress using the sewing skills she’d perfected from her years of cosplay.\nAnd when she was planning her speech and considering what to say, Amelia dug out the spreadsheets she’d compiled when she first met Lucas.\n“I printed signs with the graphs I made,” she says. “Everyone thought it was very funny.”\nMeanwhile Lucas’ best friend from Argentina made a speech in which he recounted the moment Lucas first told him he’d met Amelia – and how he’d known she was someone special based on the excited, heartfelt tone of Lucas’ voice.\nThe wedding also nodded to Amelia and Lucas’ first conversation in Bow Bar about their shared love of “Star Wars.” Midway through their first dance – to The Beatles’ “In My Life” – the couple interrupted proceedings to have a mini lightsaber battle.\n“Secretly, we had hidden some lightsabers with a couple of our friends,” explains Amelia, laughing. “So halfway through the dance. We did a little lightsaber action, little tiny dance fight, and then back to dancing.”\n“You wouldn’t think that lightsabers would work with the Beatles in my life. When I say it out loud, it sounds like a really weird combination, but it was really fun.”\nA month or so later, Lucas and Amelia relocated from D.C. to Seattle, Washington, where Amelia had grown up and where her parents still lived.\nShe was ready to leave the US capital, and figured if she and Lucas might have a kid, it’d be nice to be closer to family.\nAs for Lucas, serendipitously, Seattle happened to be a perfect fit. He loved grunge music (“I was a kid in the ‘90s,” he shrugs), IPA beers and black coffee. He was instantly “so happy” there.\nRelated article\nTwo strangers met in Berlin. Here’s how they ended up having ‘three weddings’\nCut to today and Lucas and Amelia still live in Seattle. Lucas set up his own successful Seattle-based DJ business, while Amelia’s still working in political data analysis. The couple are also kept busy by their three-year-old son Jude.\nHe’s named – of course – for The Beatles song, “Hey Jude.” The name seemed appropriate, given Lucas and Amelia both love The Beatles and talked about the band that first night in Edinburgh.\n“It’s so funny because those things – the fact that we both love ‘Star Wars’ and The Beatles – it mattered a lot at the beginning because it was like, ‘Oh, we have these things in common,’” reflects Amelia. “And now I don’t think about them so much, because we just have a whole life together.”\n“I think shared values are, in the end, way more important than a shared taste for movies,” agrees Lucas.\nIt’s their similar  approach to life, Lucas suggests, that’s led him and Amelia to the happiness they continue to enjoy today.\nPlus, while they still enjoy watching the same TV and movies, Amelia and Lucas’ tastes do occasionally diverge. Amelia loves a Broadway musical, for example, which isn’t Lucas’ vibe. Meanwhile Amelia’s never quite got her head around Lucas’ passion for heavy metal.\nThe pandemic, and then the birth of Jude, put a pause on Lucas and Amelia’s desire to travel the world together post-wedding. But in 2023, the couple embarked on a long-awaited “amazing” Honeymoon to Japan, leaving Jude in the care of his grandparents.\nAlso on the travel agenda is one day returning to Edinburgh, this time with Jude in tow. Amelia and Lucas want to show their son where they met, and retrace the steps of their first evening together.\n“We’re going to take Jude to the bar,” says Lucas.\n“Put him on the bar,” adds Amelia, laughing. “And say, ‘This is your fault.’”\n“Free drinks for us,” jokes Lucas.\nIn reality, they’ll probably hold off on returning to Edinburgh until Jude’s old enough to enjoy the trip in his own right.\n“Maybe on our 10 year anniversary, or something,” says Amelia. “There’s so much of Scotland I’ve never seen, so we definitely want to go back there someday.”\nSomething Lucas and Amelia still marvel at is the idea that they’re so compatible, despite the fact they grew up thousands of miles from each other – and only happened to be in the same bar, in the same city, in the same country by happenstance.\n“It’s so weird, he’s just a random guy in a bar,” says Amelia.\n“From a different country,” adds Lucas.\nNeither are who the other envisaged when they imagined a prospective life partner.\nLucas – who recalls breaking up with an ex who lived 15 minutes away from him because he felt like they were from “different worlds” – finds it incongruous yet incredible that he ended up marrying someone he met on vacation.\nAs for Amelia, she always figured she’d end up with a fellow Ivy League graduate, who also worked in the D.C. politics world.\n“It wasn’t like, ‘Oh I must be with that kind of person,’” she says. “But you just get an idea of, ‘This is probably who I will end up with.’ I never would have assumed it would be a DJ from Argentina.”\nAll this suggests, says Amelia and Lucas, that compatibility has little to do with shared backgrounds. It goes back to that shared values thing and being on the same wavelength, they say – and the idea of being open, of willingly embarking on adventures.\n“I mean, it doesn’t mean you’re going to absolutely find the love of your life from traveling,” says Lucas.\n“You could find the love of one night, and that can be fun too,” says Amelia.\nAmelia and Lucas are also grateful that their relationship continues to develop as they grow together.\n“We were in love,” says Lucas of their 2018 selves. “But we didn’t know each other 100% as we do know.”\n“I always felt certain about you,” says Amelia to Lucas. “But I’m more in love with you all the time. It’s wonderful.”\n",

        "content": "One man’s loss is another man’s gain, goes the saying – and as Boeing seems caught in a spiral of bad news, one aircraft manufacturer is quietly powering ahead.\nBrazilian manufacturer Embraer, which specializes in smaller narrow-body passenger jets, has been clocking up major announcements, and will soon comprise the entire regional fleet of American Airlines.\nAnd now, rumor has it that the company might be setting its sights even higher. A Wall Street Journal report last week suggested that Embraer – currently the world’s third largest aircraft manufacturer – was planning a new narrow-body jet that could “compete head-on” with the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 Max, which have cornered the global market.\nEmbraer has denied the reports. Yet the company’s star is certainly on the rise.\nOn May 2, Embraer delivered its 1,800th E-Jet aircraft: an E190-E2, to Royal Jordanian Airlines. Five days later, Singapore-based Scoot Airlines took delivery of its first Embraer: another E190-E2, the quietest and most fuel-efficient single-aisle jet on the market.\nEven in the US, where Boeing has traditionally ruled the roost, Embraer has been making waves.\nOn March 26, United announced a refurb of its Embraer E175 fleet to add larger overhead bins on its Skywest-operated planes. The move will increase storage space by 80%. Skywest is the world’s largest operator of Embraer’s E175 aircraft.\nThen there’s American Airlines, which announced the purchase of 90 E175 aircraft in March, making AA’s entire regional fleet Embraer by the end of the decade.\nThe love-in continued in April, when CEO Robert Isom praised the Brazilian company during a quarterly call. “The rest of the industry… can learn a lot from them,” he said, while also delivering a public rebuke to Boeing to, “Get your act together.”\nIt’s almost as if as Boeing’s star continues to fall, Embraer’s continues to rise. But can it go even bigger – and turn the “Big Two” of the skies into a “Big Three?”\nTo do so would require coming up with a new, larger aircraft to rival the 737MAX and the A320. At the moment, Embraer aircraft carry a maximum of 146 passengers, compared to the MAX’s minimum 172. It’d also mean scaling up – Embraer delivered 181 jets in 2023, of which 64 were commercial aircraft. Before the pandemic, it was delivering around 90 commercial aircraft per year.\nYet as Boeing struggles to regain public trust, experts say there’s room for someone else to grab a place in the market.\n“The door is open a little for a [Boeing] 737 replacement,” says Robert van der Linden, curator of air transportation at the National Air and Space Museum. Although he notes that it could close again “quickly,” and that debuting a new aircraft is a colossal task for manufacturers, he believes that Embraer might uniquely be capable of making headway in the aviation market – it already has the contacts and reputation.\nRodrigo Silva e Souza, Embraer’s VP of marketing who’s responsible for strategic planning, doesn’t deny that he’s looking at potential options, but says, “That’s my job.”\n“Designing, producing and delivering high-quality, highly reliable products is in our DNA, and I think that’s bringing some contrasts with what we’re seeing with other players,” he says, carefully.\nBut he tells CNN that aircraft take at least a decade to design and build, so while the current gap looks promising, they won’t be jumping in feet-first.\n“Designing an aircraft takes 10 years, and in 10 years from now the situation is completely different.\n“If someone had designed this before, they could be jumping in now, but you don’t decide to make a new aircraft and have it ready next year,” he says.\nSo could Embraer muscle its way to the top? It’s made it against the odds so far.\nFor an aircraft manufacturer with such a toehold in the US market, Embraer’s origins might come as a surprise.\nBased in São José dos Campos, in the state of São Paulo, the company was founded in 1969 by the Brazilian government – its name is a portmanteau of Empresa Brasileira de Aeronáutica (Aeronautics Corporation of Brazil) – on the back of the development of the Bandeirante, a twin-turboprop aircraft.\nInitially used for the Brazilian military, the Bandeirante entered commercial service in 1972. With 15-21 seats, it was aimed at “commuter companies,” says Alvaro Romero, a Chilean aviation historian.\nRelated article\nChina’s C919 passenger jet to make first commercial flight\nThe company was privatized in 1994, and went public on the stock market in 2000. By that time, says van der Linden, it had already cracked the US.\n“They found a very comfortable niche market for regional jets,” he says.\n“It was very wise not to compete directly with Boeing and Airbus. Try and break into an oligopoly and chances are you’re going to get squashed.\n“Regional jets carry anything from 35 to almost 150 passengers and Embraer grabbed hold of that market.”\nIn the regional market, Embraer’s primary competitor was Canada’s Bombardier, which sold its commercial manufacturing arm to Airbus in 2020.\nIn fact, Embraer nearly made a similar deal with Boeing in 2019, when the US giant signed up to take an 80% stake in the Brazilian company’s commercial division – before reneging on the deal in 2020. You could call it Embraer’s lucky escape.\nNow, says Silva e Souza, Embraer’s main rival is Airbus itself.\nSo how has Embraer succeeded where others have failed? For van der Linden, Brazil was far-sighted. “As early as the 1940s, the Brazilian government was interested in establishing aviation and aerospace manufacturing,” he says. Government backing meant that Embraer had money to produce quality planes from the outset. “It developed a very well-deserved reputation,” he says.\nFor aero historian Mario Overall, a member of the Latin American Aviation Historical Society, Embraer is an “exceptional” company. He puts that global success down to several factors, from its diverse portfolio (Embraer still makes military airplanes and private jets) to its designs, export strategy and outsourcing supply, keeping costs down. “Its versatility has enabled Embraer to cater to a wide range of customers,” he says. Yet he calls taking on Boeing a “daunting” process and doesn’t believe it’ll develop a larger narrowbody.\nWith major US carriers operating small planes on regional routes, Embraer’s focus on sub-200 passenger planes – its largest, the E195, has a maximum capacity of 146 seats – is a perfect fit for the US market. They’re also used on less-trafficked routes in Latin America and Europe, as well as at difficult airports. At London City, which requires a steep 5.5 degree approach for the short runway, 85% of the aircraft are Embraers.\nAnd while, by the numbers, AA and United are its top clients, Embraer’s biggest airline fan is perhaps LOT Polish Airlines, where 43 of its 75-strong fleet are Embraers (this week, it announced another three).\n“These aircraft have been instrumental in our strategy to expand our network, allowing us to confidently launch new routes, even to destinations with initially lower demand. The Embraer fleet’s reliability, efficiency, and passenger appeal make them indispensable,” says LOT spokesperson Krzysztof Moczulski.\nIt’s not just airlines; plenty of frequent flyers have a crush, too.\n“In Europe, it’s the best way to fly economy,” says Koen Berghuis of the 82-seater ERJ-175, which he flies on regularly with LOT.\n“You have so much legroom, shoulder room, and some airlines have really comfortable seating. You don’t feel like you’re in a sardine can, which I feel on the Boeing 737 MAX. But the 2-2 configuration is the main benefit,” says Berghuis, editor-in-chief of travel blog Paliparan.\nThat’s right – the dreaded middle seat simply doesn’t exist. In first class on American and United, Embraer goes one better – it’s a 1-2 configuration. The smaller jets even have 1-2 in economy, too.\nRelated article\nWhen is a car faster than a plane? When it’s electric\nTravel vlogger Paul Lucas actively seeks to fly Embraer.\n“It’s really pleasant to fly on – it has really big windows that mean loads of cabin light,” he says (van der Linden compares the windows of a bijou Embraer to those on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner).\n“They feel like mainline jets inside, but have the operational benefits of a regional jet,” Lucas says of Embraer’s E-jet range. “They probably should get more of a profile.”\nFor him, a key reason why Embraer doesn’t get the same hype as the Big Two is that it’s Brazilian.\n“In the US, Boeing is a flagship company – Americans were proud of it until recently. And Airbus is pan-European,” he says.\n“Then there’s Embraer.”\nAs Boeing spirals, is there a chance for Embraer to break through?\nSilva e Souza says that the company’s current focus is the Energia project, which aims to develop 30-seater hybrid-electric aircraft by 2030, slashing the aircraft carbon emissions by 30% (90% if using SAF). A hydrogen-fuel-cell version is planned for 2035, with a 50-seater scheduled for 2040.\nHe also predicts an untapped market for small, sustainable planes to replace long drives.\nAnd while he insists that the company is concentrating on “harvesting” following “10-15 years of very strong development” – he’s not denying that they’re eyeing all options.\nAt the Dubai Airshow in November, he hinted that the company was scanning markets such as the Middle East, where it says that only 16% of flights are full – meaning smaller aircraft could make certain routes more profitable. Meanwhile the company’s 2023 Market Outlook report suggests that “the future lies in the middle” – which Silva e Souza defines as 100-150 seats.\nCould that “middle” get a little bigger, though? The troubled Boeing MAX starts at 172 seats – not far off Embraer’s E2-195, which seats 146.\nThe only other potential competitor is Comac’s C919, currently only certified to operate in China. Silva e Souza believes that Chinese-made aircraft will make it into the global market, but “it’ll take a long time.”\nHe doesn’t deny that Embraer is monitoring the market, however. “We speak to investors. We keep looking: smaller, bigger, commercial, defense – for each we talk to partners who will help build the business case. But we’ve done nothing specifically on the [MAX rival].\n“We’re confident in our capabilities. But it’s very different taking decisions on the current situation for a product that will come 10 years from now.”\nIf they did take the plunge, they have an army of fans waiting to take flight.\n",

        "content": "Can an iron structure stand tall for 1,600 years without rusting, despite being exposed to the elements?\nIt seems implausible, considering the supposed lack of technology at the time of its construction.\nYet, inside New Delhi’s UNESCO-listed Qutb Minar complex – a collection of historic monuments and buildings built in the early 13th century in the city’s southern Mehrauli district – one mysterious structure stands as a testament to this very enigma.\nVisitors to the courtyard of the complex’s Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque will immediately spot an imposing 7.2-meter, six-ton iron pillar with a decorative top that’s even older than the complex.\nRemarkably, the pillar is now as pristine as the day it was forged, defying both age and environmental adversities, including the Indian capital’s intense temperatures and increasing pollution. Dating back to the 5th century, its remarkable resilience continues to captivate travelers today.\nTypically, iron and iron alloy structures exposed to the air or moisture oxidize over time, rendering them coated in rust unless they are protected, like the Eiffel Tower, by layers of special paint. Scientists both in India and abroad began studying the iron pillar in Delhi in 1912 to try to figure out why it hadn’t corroded.\nIt wasn’t until 2003 that experts at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in the northern city of Kanpur cracked the mystery, revealing the answer in the journal Current Science.\nThey found that the pillar, primarily made of wrought iron, has a high phosphorus content (about 1%), and lacks sulfur and magnesium, unlike modern iron. Additionally, ancient craftsmen used a technique called “forge-welding.”\nThat means they heated and hammered the iron, keeping the high phosphorus content intact, a method uncommon in modern practices.\nArcheo-metallurgist R. Balasubramaniam, who authored the report, said that this unconventional approach contributed to the pillar’s enduring strength.\nRelated article\nIndia is a hiker’s dream destination. Here are a dozen of its most epic trails\nA thin layer of “misawite,” a compound of iron, oxygen and hydrogen, was also found on the pillar’s surface, he said. This layer is formed catalytically by the presence of high phosphorus in the iron and the absence of lime, thus further enhancing the pillar’s durability.\nBalasubramaniam lauded the metallurgists for their ingenuity, describing the pillar as “a living testament to India’s ancient metallurgical prowess.”\nIts durability is evidenced by historical accounts, including an incident in the 18th century when a cannonball fired at the pillar reportedly failed to break it, showcasing the impressive strength of this ancient monument.\nToday, the pillar serves as the emblem of scientific organizations like the National Metallurgical Laboratory and the Indian Institute of Metals.\nBeyond its metallurgical intrigue, the origin of the Iron Pillar is also veiled in mystery. One widely circulated account traces it back to the Gupta Empire, particularly under the reign of Chandragupta II, also known as Vikramaditya, around the 4th and 5th centuries.\nAccording to this tale, the pillar was erected in the Varah Temple of Udayagiri Caves, near Vidisha in Madhya Pradesh, as a victory monument dedicated to the Hindu deity Lord Vishnu. It’s said to have once borne a statue of Garuda, the mythical eagle mount of Vishnu, on its top, though this figure has been lost to history.\nAnother theory, proposed by heritage activist and educator Vikramjit Singh Rooprai, suggests it may have been bought by Varāhamihira, a renowned astronomer in the court of King Vikramaditya.\n“One of his books, the ‘Surya Siddhanta,’ details methods for calculating celestial positions, eclipses, and other astronomical phenomena - and it is believed that he used a tall pillar in his calculations,” says Vikramjit.\n“Therefore, upon his migration from Vidisha to Mihirapuri (now Mehrauli), where he founded an observatory, there exists a likelihood that he brought the pillar with him for continued use in his studies and calculations.”\nRelated article\nDevil’s dung or dinner delight? The story behind hing, one of India’s most divisive ingredients\nAdditionally, some historical records credit notable figures like Raja Anangpal of the Tomar dynasty, and Muslim rulers such as Iltutmish and Qutbuddin Aibek, for the relocation of the pillar to the Qutb complex.\nIt’s also been mentioned in the arts. In the epic poem “Prithviraj Raso,” penned by Chand Bardai, a courtier in the Chahamana dynasty under King Prithviraj Chauhan, the Iron Pillar holds great significance.\n“Bardai describes the Iron Pillar in Raso as a nail holding the Earth on the hoof of Sheshnag, the serpent king in Hindu mythology,” says Vikramjit.\n“Raso recounts how Raja Anangpal tried to uproot this nail despite warnings from Brahmins of dire consequences. When it was pulled out, revealing a red base believed to be Sheshnag’s blood, panic ensued, fearing Earth’s destruction. Anangpal quickly ordered its reinstallation, but it was not properly secured, resulting in it becoming loose. Thus, Bardai suggests that this incident inspired the colloquial name ‘Dilli’ for Delhi, which is a pun on the word ‘dhilli’, meaning ‘loose’ in Hindi.”\nAccording to one legend, if you stand with your back against the pillar and wrap your arms around it, making sure your fingers touch each other, your wish will come true – a tradition that imbues the pillar with spiritual significance beyond its historical value.\nHowever, the ASI (Archeological Survey of India) has put a fence around the pillar to minimize human impact.\nConservation architect and heritage expert, Pragya Nagar, finds the pillar’s preservation remarkable within the complex, despite the demolition and reconstruction of its surroundings over the years.\n“If we do look at the technique that was used to create the pillar from a fresh perspective, beyond mere acknowledgment of its ancient origins, we may discover avenues to leverage similar methods for the development of sustainable material alternatives, considering the environmental harm associated with processes like metal extraction,” she tells CNN.\n“It is imperative to look at history beyond relics and monuments that simply need to be conserved and marveled at, but as repositories of traditional knowledge and indigenous practices. This holistic approach has the potential to pave the way towards a more sustainable future.”\n",

        "content": "They’d always planned to retire somewhere outside the US, but when the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020, Cynthia Wilson and her husband Craig Bjork felt compelled to bring their plans forward.\nThe couple, who married in 2009, had already chosen Portugal as their intended destination after Googling “best places for Americans to retire to” and finding that the European country – a place Wilson had never visited – was high on the list.\n“It’s funny because I’ve been to like 33 countries, and almost all of northwest Europe,” Wilson, originally from Seattle, tells CNN Travel. “I’ve been to countries like Estonia, but I almost knew nothing about Portugal.\nThankfully, her husband, a former US marine, “knew everything about it.”\n“It was an ‘Aha’ moment for me,” says the retired chef and restaurant owner, explaining that Bjork was stationed in Lisbon during the late 1970s and “had regaled me with stories about his life there.”\nThe couple, who met when they were both in their 50s, initially bonded over their love for travel, and Wilson says that it’s been a “never ending conversation” ever since.\n“We started talking about our travels,” she recounts. “And we still are talking about our travels.”\nOnce they were married, Wilson and Bjork, who were based in Kansas at the time, began to think more seriously about the type of life that they wanted to have during their retirement years.\n“We were both watching our parents spend their entire savings and pensions on medical care,” says Wilson, explaining that they did a lot of research into the cost of living in Portugal and found it to be more favorable.\n“And, in Portugal, we could keep our money for travel. We were required to have private medical insurance as part of the visa process.\n“But we also would have access to the national system, particularly for hospitalizations.”\nWilson and Bjork, who previously ran a food truck named LumpiaPalooza and the Parsnipity Cafe in Wichita, Kansas, initially gave themselves six years “to plan and dream about moving to Portugal.”\nHowever, they opted to speed things up “rather than to go into debt to keep the business alive” during the pandemic.\n“We decided to retire two years early,” explains Wilson. “So we retired in 2020 and started the paperwork.”\nThe couple applied for a D7 visa, also known as the “Retirement visa,” which required them to meet specific requirements, including either proof of purchase of a property in the country or a rental agreement of at least 12 months.\nThey put a lot of time and energy into choosing which town to live in, eventually settling on the small town of Marinha Grande, located on the Silver Coast close to famed surfing beach Nazare.\nWilson explains that they were keen to move somewhere that they could integrate themselves into the local community and spend time with Portuguese people rather than other Americans.\n“Many people moving to Portugal like to call themselves ‘expats’ and spend their time at ‘Meetups’ where they can whine to other ‘expats’ about how no one in Portugal speaks English, how they can’t find their exact brand of tinned beans and accuse the ‘natives’ of being impossible to get to know,” she says.\n“This was not the life we wanted. We wanted to be immigrants, people moving to a new country to become a part of their culture and community.”\nOnce their visa had been approved and border restrictions had lifted, the couple moved to Marinha Grande, which has a population of just under 40,000, in January 2022.\nThey initially stayed in an Airbnb, which cost them around $800 per month, and soon found themselves hosting some of the friends they’d connected with via a town Facebook page before traveling over.\n“I was cooking dinner out of our Airbnb two or three times a week for my Portuguese friends,” says Wilson, before adding that they were warmly received by the locals, who seemed intrigued by them.\n“People never pegged us as Americans,” says Wilson. “I think they can’t peg us at all. We seldom get guessed as Americans, and we’re fine with that.”\nAs the couple began to settle into their new lives, Wilson, who describes herself as an “over-achiever,” struggled with having so much time on her hands.\n“Retirement’s been hard for me,” she admits. “Because I’m a ‘Type A’ person. My entire life has been work, work, work. I have a list and I live by the list.\n“And now it’s like, I don’t even know what day of the week it is. And that’s been a struggle.\n“But I’m in the right place for that. Because that’s kind of OK here. No one looks down at me because I’m not racing all over the world and achieving, achieving and achieving.”\nWilson and Bjork are both currently taking Portuguese language classes provided by the government. However, Wilson admits that she hasn’t found learning a new language easy.\n“Portuguese, the language is very hard,” says Wilson, explaining that she speaks Japanese and Spanish as well as “tourist German, Danish and French.”\n“I’m really good at languages. But Portuguese is a challenge to learn.\n“We don’t find it easy. We find it manageable. Some people, especially people our age, don’t find it manageable.”\nThe couple have also had to change the way that they approach people, particularly while asking for things at shops, after noticing that their direct manner wasn’t being received well.\n“My Portuguese friends taught me that you have to first recognize their humanity,” says Wilson.\nRelated article\nHow falling for a stranger she met on a beach led this woman to ditch the US for the French Riviera\n“And you do this by saying, ‘Good morning. How are you?’ And they say, ‘I’m well. Are you well?’ And once you’ve done that, it’s like a magic key that will open good service up to you.”\nWilson goes on to explain that she finds this attitude refreshing, as the focus is firmly on people and personal relationships.\n“Their ethic is not job first, or money first,” she adds. “Their ethic is family and leisure…\n“So that’s refreshing, to see people valuing relationships above the rat race. The rat died here. There’s no place for that.”\nWilson has warmly embraced the Portuguese way of life, particularly the focus on food, which has long been a big part of her life.\n“The people eat together all the time,” she says. “Sunday is considered family day. So there’s a big family meal at everybody’s mom or dad’s house and everybody gathers together and eats.\n“Portuguese women my age are always cooking. I’ve spent a lot of time with them learning Portuguese food.”\nWhile Wilson and Bjork had originally planned to use Portugal as a “jumping off point” to travel around the rest of Europe, they’ve been too busy dealing with all of the tasks that come with relocating to a new country to venture very far.\n“There’s a lot to it,” says Wilson. “From governmental stuff, getting your residency card. Then you have to transfer your driver’s license and find a car [if you drive].\n“You have to buy everything [for your house]. And you have to set up yourself with medical and utilities. Really, it’s a huge process.”\nWhen asked if she and her husband have found Portugal to be more affordable, Wilson points out that this is all relative to their own experiences, noting their Portuguese friends “push back a little” if they comment on how much cheaper things are, as it’s not necessarily cheap for them.\n“We made that mistake,” she admits. “When we first came, we were like, ‘Oh it’s practically free.’ And we had to quit doing that, because it was offending them [their friends].”\nShe points out that what seems very affordable to them, may not be to affordable to a Portuguese worker earning minimum wage.\n“A lot of people make minimum wage,” she adds. “So that being said… Yes. For Americans, it is cheaper to live here, if you don’t live in Lisbon, Porto or the Algarve.\n“Those places are like trying to live in San Francisco or Manhattan. Those are expensive cities.\n“So if you have your heart set on living in one of those places, you’re going to pay three times what we pay, probably. In rent, food, everything.”\nDuring their time in Portugal, the pair have adopted two rescue cats, grandly named Rainha Doce Florabela de Portugal and Rainha Joia Fofa Maria da Silva, through nonprofit organization The Kitten Connection.\nWilson will be making snacks for an upcoming fundraising event for the organization and has also been giving regular cooking lessons to a local teenager.\n“He loves Asian food and it’s not that easy to get here in Marinha Grande,” she explains. “So we got the idea of him learning from me.”\nShe and her husband regularly host dinner parties, including an annual Thanksgiving celebration, and attend local events, such as children’s concerts and sports games.\nBeing a part of such a close-knit community has been a dream come true for Wilson, who says that they nearly always bump into someone they know while out and about.\n“We have been here for over two years and grow happier every day with our decision,” adds Wilson.\n“We have a wealth of Portuguese friends who have helped us every step of the way and opened the doors to their homes and hearts to us.”\nWilson had become incredibly jaded by the political climate in the US before relocating, and was particularly concerned about gun violence.\n“I tell people, ‘We fled the country,” she says. “The way everything was heading… We felt outraged and enraged every minute of the day.”\nShe hasn’t been back for a visit since moving to Portugal and says she has no plans to ever return.\n“I will return to the US in an urn. Period,” she stresses. “There’s literally nothing that would compel me to return to the US.”\nWhile Wilson misses her family and friends, she says that she’s an adventurer at heart and never intended to spend the rest of her days in America.\nRelated article\nWhy this American woman has ditched the US for Portugal\n“Some people asked how I could leave my children or what my children think about it.” she says, stressing that her children are grown ups living their own lives.\n“And I have traveled my whole life on my own, leaving my children and my husband to travel for two weeks a year, every year. Just because it was that important to me.\n“And I’m a little bit of a bohemian type of person. So my kids expected nothing less than [me] going out this way. Doing something odd.”\nWilson and Bjork say that they’ve had “zero problems” since relocating to Portugal and couldn’t be happier.\nIn fact, things have gone so well that others are sometimes skeptical when they recount their experiences.\n“People are like, ‘You just see everything through rose-colored glasses.’ But everything is as perfect as I say,” says Wilson.\n“It has unfolded without any problems for us. It doesn’t happen that way for everyone – I know that. But I’m going to celebrate what we got. And we got a great experience.”\n",

        "content": "The first four months of 2024 have proven some of the most difficult in Ukraine's two years of full-scale war with Russia, and perhaps the most straining in a decade-long conflict with Moscow that erupted in 2014.\nKyiv's troops are on the back foot all along the front line, facing a reconstituted Russian military supported by an economy shifted onto a war footing with massive Chinese assistance. Ukraine's Western backers have been slow to provide weapons and hesitant to take the wider fight to Russia. Distracted and divided by a slew of elections, Ukraine's Western bloc is creaking.\nThis year is expected to be hard for Ukraine following its disappointing 2023 offensive, on which so much hope and so many resources were staked.\nKusti Salm, the permanent secretary at the Estonian Defense Ministry, told Newsweek \"2024 will be difficult\" in a December interview.\n\"They need to assume the defensive; they need to grind it out,\" he said of Ukrainian forces.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin's apparent plan to outlast his adversaries may be working. Or this year might yet prove to be Ukraine's dark night before the dawn.\nDuring a recent visit to Ukraine, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg urged allies to fulfill their military aid commitments to Kyiv and declared: \"It's not too late for Ukraine to prevail.\"\nRussia's grinding westward push is continuing all along the eastern front, with Moscow's troops straining at great cost to seize new territory in the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia regions. The total capture of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts has been a key Kremlin goal since it fomented rebellion in eastern Ukraine in 2014, and a decade on the ambition appears in reach.\nThe current plodding offensive is laying the groundwork for an expected fresh summer campaign. Among the potential targets of the new push are the Donetsk city of Chasiv Yar—which is already on the front line and may even fall before summer—and the Kharkiv city of Kupiansk, a vital gateway to Ukraine's second city of Kharkiv.\nThe Institute for the Study of War wrote this week that Russia's capture and stabilization of a salient northwest of Avdiivka \"presents the Russian command with a choice of either continuing to push west towards its reported operational objective in Pokrovsk or trying to drive northward to conduct possible complementary offensive operations with the Russian effort around Chasiv Yar.\"\nNewsweek has contacted the Russian Defense Ministry by email to request comment.\nChasiv Yar is only six miles east of Bakhmut, which has long been a hotspot on the Donetsk front, even after its fall to Russian forces in May 2023. Now abandoned by almost all of its prewar residents, the city was a vital staging point for Ukrainian forces and sits on a hill with commanding views over the surrounding area.\nIt is also a gateway to the cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, both strategic level objectives for Moscow's forces in their bid to capture all of the Donetsk region.\nKyiv focused significant resources in Chasiv Yar after Moscow fomented rebellion in the Donbas in 2014, making it home to an important military hospital and later the headquarters for the Joint Forces Operation against Russia and its local proxies.\nPokrovsk is around 26 miles northwest of Avdiivka at the junction of two major roads heading to the city of Donetsk and to Bakhmut, as well as a railway heading through Avdiivka. A successful drive all the way to Pokrovsk would expose the southern flanks of Chasiv Yar, Kramatorsk and Slovyansk.\nPavel Luzin, a Russian military analyst and visiting scholar at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, told Newsweek it is \"hard to say\" whether Moscow's forces will be able to scale up their current drive for a larger summer push.\n\"There are not too many resources for a bigger offensive,\" Luzin said. \"Also, almost all these expectations are inspired by Moscow itself.\n\"What we do see is that Russia was trying to surround a significant group of the Ukrainian forces in Avdiivka, exactly like in Ilovaisk in August 2014 and in Debaltsevo in February 2015, but was incapable of doing this. Perhaps, Russia will make another attempt in the same way, because it needs stronger positions in order to get a break in the war.\"\nThis break, Luzin added, would allow the Kremlin to rest and reinforce its mauled forces. Leaders in Kyiv have repeatedly warned that Moscow is only interested in a temporary ceasefire to this end, not in a lasting peace. Luzin concurred.\n\"They need a break, but they are not going to end the war,\" he said.\nPutin may hope to win space for a pause having won all of Donetsk and Luhansk, long at the center of his project to dismantle Ukrainian sovereignty.\n\"For today, they want to get at least Donetsk and Luhansk,\" Luzin said. \"The problem is that the Kremlin claims Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions as Russia territory as well.\"\nWhile Ukraine digs in, Kyiv will also be looking to disrupt Russian communications, logistics, and industry as much as possible. Long-range drone strikes on targets inside Russia have become commonplace, and Ukraine shows little sign of easing its attacks even in the face of American displeasure.\nThe arrival of the longest-range iteration of the American ATACMS—the MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System—will give Kyiv greater reach than ever before. The longest-range munition can hit targets out to 186 miles, almost double that of shorter range ATACMS munition first provided in late 2023. Among its possible targets is the logistically arterial and symbolically powerful Kerch Strait Bridge.\nBut as with all new weapons, Kyiv has a closing window in which to exploit the ATACMS.\n\"As we know, the Russians are able to adapt in a very short period of time,\" Ivan Stupak, a former officer in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and now an adviser to the Ukrainian parliament's national security, defense and intelligence committee, told Newsweek.\n\"I think we have up to two months to eliminate as many Russian war objects as is possible before the Russians will adapt,\" Stupak added.\nThis year may see a significant shift in air power, with Ukraine awaiting the delivery of dozens of American-made F-16 fighter jets. Kyiv has said the aircraft will boost its defense against cruise missiles and drones being launched at cities nationwide, and also give much needed relief for front line troops being bombarded by Russian airstrikes.\nMoscow's glide bombs have been pivotal in the first part of 2024, allowing its aircraft to drop massive munitions on Ukrainian positions from a relatively safe distance. F-16s will make front line areas more dangerous for Russian pilots, given Ukraine expects to be using air-to-air missiles with ranges of up to 310 miles.\nWhile Ukraine has been waiting for F-16s, Russia has been losing planes. Recent months have seen an uptick in reported Russian aircraft being downed, including far behind the front line. Those losses—and the subsequent added strain placed on surviving planes—may prove challenging for the Russian air force in the aerial battles to come.\nStill, leaders in Kyiv and some allies abroad have repeatedly warned that a drip-fed and small force of F-16s will do little to change the overall picture. It remains to be seen if Western powers can master the logistical and political challenges to deliver a large number of the jets in a manner that can give Ukraine a battlefield edge.\nBut the newly arriving aircraft will help bolster a Ukrainian air force whittled down by two years of war. Kyiv's pilots survived Russia's initial onslaught despite the vast numerical superiority of the invaders. Ukrainian airmen performed far beyond expectations, inflicting serious losses on their Russian counterparts and making large areas of Ukraine too dangerous for Moscow's aircraft.\nThe naval asymmetric cat-and-mouse game will likely continue. Kyiv's drones and cruise missiles have proven deeply problematic for the Black Sea Fleet. The force has adapted its tactics and defenses to some degree, but new iterations of Ukrainian long-range weapons will continue to pose a potent littoral threat.\nThat threat has already forced Moscow to withdraw its most high-value naval assets from occupied Crimea, the traditional home of the Black Sea Fleet and the nexus of power projection in the region and into the Mediterranean Sea. Kyiv is constantly developing its naval drones and is expected to continue strike efforts even deep into Russian waters.\nUkraine has no significant conventional navy of its own, though leaders in Kyiv have long been working with Western partners to secure new vessels, including armored riverine boats from the U.S.\nThese small ships will not be able to challenge the Black Sea Fleet, a job which will remain assigned to the asymmetric drone fleet that has proven so successful. Ukraine will spend the rest of 2024 hoping to twist the knife and exacerbate Russia's problems at sea.\n",

        "content": "Senator Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican, was confronted on Sunday morning about discussions he may have had this weekend with Donald Trump about the possibility of being the former president's running mate in this year's election.\nKristen Welker, host of NBC News' Meet the Press, pressed Scott several times about Saturday's donor event at Mar-a-Lago, which was expected to attract more than 400 donors and featured several of Trump's rumored vice-presidential picks.\n\"Did you discuss with the former president the possibility of being his running mate?\" Welker asked the senator on Sunday.\nScott, a Trump ally, then responded, \"No ma'am. What we talked this weekend about how bad the economy is for single parents like the one that raised me. We had a lot of conversations around the room about the importance of eliminating 'Bidenomics' and getting inflation back under 2 percent...We had no conversations about the VP pick to be honest with you, to be clear.\"\nAs Scott continued to talk about economic issues, Welker pressed the senator, twice, asking, \"Just to be very clear, it didn't come up at all? Do you think you're on the short list?\"\n\"I hope that the president will choose a person [as vice president] who helps the country unite and heal,\" Scott smiled as he replied. \"I certainly expect to have a decision from the president in the next 60 days or so. He didn't bring it up and I certainly didn't bring it up.\"\nThe senator added: \"I'm just excited that in this nation, a poor kid from South Carolina can rise to the level of being a United States senator. It just tells me that all things are possible for kids growing up in poverty today. Kids growing up today, listen to this show and know, all things are possible in your future.\"\nNewsweek reached out to the Trump campaign Sunday morning for comment. This story will be updated with any provided statements.\nAccording to a copy of this weekend's Republican National Committee (RNC) spring finance retreat program viewed by Reuters, Scott was joined by several other rumored vice-presidential picks.\nNorth Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and J.D. Vance of Ohio, and Representative Elise Stefanik of New York were all expected to attend the private event.\nNoem, however, has seen her chances of becoming Trump's running mate fall dramatically after reports of her shooting her \"untrainable\" dog emerged, according to an online prediction market.\nMost of this weekend's event was held at the Four Seasons hotel in Palm Beach while Trump hosted a fundraising lunch at his Mar-a-Lago estate on Saturday.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, was also scheduled to address the guests at Mar-a-Lago.\nThe donor event was also intended to help the Trump campaign shore up its finances.\nThe presumptive Republican 2024 presidential nominee is facing multiple legal challenges, including his high-profile hush money case involving adult film star Stormy Daniels. Trump has pleaded not guilty to charges that he attempted to influence the 2016 presidential election by reimbursing his lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen for payments to silence Daniels over an alleged 2006 affair she had with Trump. The former president has denied the affair ever took place.\nWith the trial in the case set to last around six weeks, the former president is racking up significant legal fees. He is also facing three other indictments and related trials that could take place this year, and has maintained his innocence in those cases as well.\nThe former president has been paying his lawyers using the Save America political action committee (PAC), which has spent more than $62 million on legal fees since January 2023, Bloomberg noted.\nTrump's campaign and the RNC said on Saturday in a statement that they raised more than $76 million in April, with over half of the contributions coming from small donors. Meanwhile, the former president's campaign and the RNC said early last month that it raised $65.6 million for March.\n",

Ryan said the university has a \"long-standing prohibition on erecting tents absent a permit.\"\nRyan said that \"when UPD's attempts to resolve the situation were met with physical confrontation and attempted assault, it became necessary to rely on assistance from the Virginia State Police.\"\nPolice \"declared an unlawful assembly, issued no-trespass orders to those who refused to disperse, and arrested those who continued to refuse dispersal,\" he added.\nRyan said he recognized that some would disagree with the decision to call in police, adding that the \"entire episode was upsetting, frightening and sad\" and \"an aberration.\"\nThe student protesters said that police had responded violently to a peaceful protest.\nOfficers \"brought these weapons to a peaceful encampment,\" the UVA Encampment for Gaza account wrote on X, formerly Twitter, alongside a photo of an officer carrying an assault-type rifle. \"They beat us. They maced us. They brutalized us.\"\nStudents for Justice in Palestine at the University of Virginia shared a video on Instagram showing state police pointing guns at protesters, noting that it came on the anniversary of the Kent State massacre—when the Ohio National Guard opened fire on unarmed college students during an anti-war protest at Kent State University in 1970, killing four and injuring nine.\nThey wrote that white nationalists and neo-Nazis who had marched on the university's campus in 2017 were not met with a similar police response.\n\"Dozens of riot police were deployed to a small Gaza solidarity encampment,\" the post's caption said. \"In 2017, hundreds of neo-Nazis and antisemites descended on UVA campus in a deadly convergence entitled 'Unite the Right,' where Heather Heyer was murdered. The fascists' only opponents were militant antifascists. Now, UVA admin is unleashing riot police on peaceful anti-genocide protesters.\"\nHeyer was killed and 19 others were injured when a car plowed into counter-protesters who had taken to the streets to decry the white nationalist rally.\nNewsweek has contacted UVA and Virginia State Police for comment via email.\nOthers also took to social media to condemn police for treating student protesters more harshly than those involved in the 2017 rally.\n\"Happening at UVA in Charlottesville, police in riot gear are moving in to arrest protesters,\" Alejandra Caraballo, a clinical instructor at the Harvard Law School's Cyberlaw Clinic, wrote on X alongside a video showing officers dragging a person away from the encampment. \"Remember when neo-Nazis openly chanted 'Jews will not replace us' and the police did nothing?\"\nJoshua P. Hill wrote: \"Seeing the outpouring of cops in Charlottesville when UVA students protest genocide vs. the absence of (uniformed) cops when Nazis rallied in Charlottesville for Unite the Right makes things very clear. This is who cops are. This is what the ruling class is.\"\nIn another post, Hill wrote: \"Never forget that Virginia cops did more to stop students protesting genocide in Charlottesville than they did to stop Nazis from marching and murdering in Charlottesville.\"\nMolly Conger wrote: \"This is the university of Virginia. they let Nazis march, but they won't let you protest genocide.\"\nSaturday's crackdown at UVA comes as students have been demonstrating on college campuses nationwide since the arrest of more than 100 protesters at Columbia University on April 18.\nStudents have erected tent encampments to call on their schools to stop doing business with Israel or companies they say are profiting from Israel's offensive in Gaza, which followed Hamas' attack on southern Israel on October 7.\nMilitants killed about 1,200 people and took roughly 250 hostages. Since then, Israel has killed more than 34,500 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, around two-thirds of them women and children, the AP reports, citing the local health ministry.\nColumbia and other universities have brought in police to dismantle the encampments, resulting in mass arrests, while some universities have struck agreements with protest organizers to end the demonstrations.\nPolice have arrested more than 2,400 people on 47 campuses since April 18, according to a tally by the AP.\nUpdate 5/5/2024, 10:40 a.m. ET: This article has been updated to add a comment from the Virginia State Police.\n",

        "content": "A new poll spells potential trouble for former President Donald Trump as he stands trial in Manhattan in his criminal hush money case.\nTrump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, became the first former president in U.S. history to stand trial in a criminal case last month. Following an investigation by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office, Trump was indicted in March 2023 on 34 charges of allegedly falsifying business records relating to hush money payments that were made to adult film star Stormy Daniels during his 2016 presidential campaign. Daniels alleges she had an affair with Trump in 2006, which he has denied. The former president has pleaded not guilty to all charges and said the case against him is politically motivated.\nDespite Trump's legal troubles, which include three other criminal indictments—all of which he has pleaded not guilty to—it remains a tight race in the polls between the former president and his likely challenger in November, President Joe Biden, the Democratic incumbent.\nHowever, this can change if Trump is convicted. According to an ABC News/Ipsos poll produced by Langer Research Associates and conducted between April 25 to 30 that was published on Sunday, 80 percent of Trump's supporters said they will continue to stand by him if he was convicted of a felony in the hush money case. Meanwhile, 20 percent of his base would either reconsider their support (16 percent) or withdraw their support of Trump (4 percent).\nThe sample size of the subgroup of Trump supporters was 937 adults with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4. The national sample size of the poll was 2,260 adults and the margin of error for the full sample was 2 percentage points. Of the national sample size, 31 percent were Democrats, 29 percent were Republicans and 28 percent were independents.\nNewsweek reached out to Trump's and Biden's campaigns as well as political experts via email for comment.\nMeanwhile, results varied in a matchup between Trump and Biden, depending on how adults in the poll identified.\nJust looking at all adults surveyed, excluding people who said they wouldn't vote, 46 percent supported Trump while 44 percent supported Biden. However, Biden led Trump among registered and likely voters. A total of 46 percent of registered voters supported Biden while 45 percent supported Trump. Meanwhile, 49 percent of likely voters supported Biden while 45 percent supported Trump.\nWhile it is still unclear how much damage a felony conviction in any of the four criminal indictments can have on Trump's campaign, a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted from February 9 to 12 found that 55 percent of American adults would not vote for Trump if he was convicted of a felony. That number is 51 percent among Republicans.\nThe full sample size of that poll was 1,237 people, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.91. The sample size of Republicans was 502, with a margin of error of plus or minus 5.26 percentage points.\n",

Those who are pregnant and their newborns, adults who are 65 years or older and people with weakened immune systems are most likely to become ill from the infection.\nRead more: Compare Top Health Savings Accounts\nThose who are pregnant and become ill with listeria may experience a fever or flu-like symptoms; others may also experience a headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and seizures, according to the CDC.\nIf the infection becomes invasive—meaning it has spread beyond the intestines—it can cause a miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery or a life-threatening infection a newborn.\nIt can also become severe for others, as about 1 in 20 people who are not pregnant and become infected with invasive listeria die, according to the CDC. People who become infected with invasive listeria may be treated with antibiotics.\nThe CDC suggests people at higher risk of developing the illness to avoid foods that may be more likely to cause the illness including unpasteurized soft cheeses, unheated deli meat, premade deli salads, refrigerated pate or meat spreads, refrigerated smoked fish, raw or lightly cooked sprouts, cut melon left open for more than two hours or in a refrigerator more than a week or unpasteurized milk products.\n",

        "content": "In April, the Biden Administration released new Title IX regulations scheduled to take effect in time for the upcoming 2024-2025 school year. Title IX is an over 50-year-old federal civil rights statute responsible for ensuring gender equality within educational settings that receive federal funding. Among other things, Title IX protects students against hostile environments, such as those arising out of campus-based sexual misconduct and anti-LGBTQ bias.\nSince 1974, the U.S. Department of Education has enforced Title IX regulations requiring federally funded educational institutions to provide \"prompt and equitable\" grievance proceedings to address complaints of sex discrimination, including those of sexual harassment and violence. These regulations originally lacked specificity, requiring the Department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) to issue guidance on what an appropriate grievance process should entail at the campus level.\nIn 2011 and 2014, among other things, President Barack Obama issued Title IX guidance requiring schools to specifically address campus sexual assaults rather than deferring these matters solely to law enforcement, and to do so within 60 days whenever possible. However, this guidance-based approach changed in 2017, when the Trump administration rescinded existing Title IX guidance to then amend the Title IX regulations for the first time in 2020.\nAs indicated in the Federal Register's regulatory comments, the Biden administration found Trump-era Title IX regulations were \"overly prescriptive\" regarding certain aspects of campus-based grievance proceedings. The Trump administration had done so intentionally to protect those accused of misconduct over those who were victimized by it. As examples, it heightened standards for issuing interim suspensions and finding sexual harassment charges, while imposing mandatory dismissals for off-campus sexual misconduct incidents and requiring live cross-examination during certain Title IX hearings.\nIt also removed any standard for the promptness requirement to leave schools without any guidance. These regulatory changes not only deterred students from making formal complaints, but also emboldened institutions to prolong grievance proceedings to exhaust and further deter students from accessing the Title IX process.\nAdvocates were frustrated with the Biden administration's year-long delay in issuing the new Title IX regulations, which have finally arrived to better protect students and are now facing legal scrutiny. While the Biden-era regulations balance due process for those accused of misconduct with the need to eradicate sex and gender-based discrimination, harassment, and violence within education, several Republican-led states have already filed lawsuits challenging the regulatory protections for LGBTQ students.\nThe outcome of these lawsuits will either help fuel or quell the ongoing \"culture wars\" within K-12 schools regarding the ability of minor students to freely express their chosen gender identity (as opposed to conforming to their assigned biological sex). On the horizon, the Biden administration will release more Title IX regulations addressing trans-athletes, which is a topic of ongoing controversy amongst policymakers.\nFor survivors of campus sexual misconduct, the new Title IX regulations undo some of the damage of the Trump-era rules by (1) ensuring former students and employees may file Title IX complaints when the accused is still at the educational institution, and allow such complaints to be made orally not just in writing, 34 C.F.R. § 106.2; (2) strongly endorsing the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard for adjudications unless the educational institution uses the heightened \"clear and convincing\" standard for all comparable misconduct proceedings, 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(h); (3) reminding institutions to issue sanctions for misconduct as well as remedies to the victim and other affected students to address resulting hostile environments on campus, 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(h)(3); and (4) clarifying that retaliation is another form of prohibited discrimination under Title IX to ensure the same procedures are followed by schools for such reports, 34 C.F.R. § 106.71. By undoing some of the barriers to justice established by the Trump-era rules, the new Title IX regulations rebalance Title IX to better advance victim protections and eliminate abuse.\nThe 2024 Title IX regulations are not likely to change the ongoing legal battles surrounding campus sexual misconduct or LGBTQ rights, but they will certainly help students equally access education in the interim, as our nation keeps working toward safer learning environments for all. The real question now is around how OCR will enforce the new regulations given the high volume of pending Title IX complaints under the Trump-era regulations and limited funding by Congress for such efforts. For those invested in safer schools, our next steps must be to call congressmembers to demand increased funding for Title IX enforcement to continue ensuring ongoing gender equality with federally funded educational settings into the future.\nLaura L.

        "content": "Title IX has helped make the United States home to some of the highest educated, most athletically dominant women on the planet. But that won't stop the Biden administration from destroying Title IX to appease the most radical members of its party.\nBefore the Biden administration announced its new rule, Title IX had one purpose: to ensure women and girls have equal access to publicly funded educational opportunities. It didn't matter if that education took place in an elementary classroom or an NCAA basketball court; the purpose of Title IX was to protect opportunities for women and girls to learn and grow in a safe environment.\nThe Biden administration, however, appears to think women have had enough success.\nUnder its new rule, President Biden's Department of Education has abandoned accepted ideas of sex and gender to single-handedly interpret Title IX as protecting students from discrimination based on \"gender identity.\" Schools must now allow students to participate in any \"activity consistent with their gender identity,\" as asserted by the students themselves, or risk facing a discrimination lawsuit.\nThis will open up schools to lawsuits if they forbid biological boys from using girls' restrooms or locker rooms. The same will be true for schools that ban biological boys from the girls' health or physical education classes.\nPut differently, Title IX will no longer protect women based on their immutable physical characteristics. Instead, activists can weaponize Title IX to force schools to prioritize the comfortable education of the boy with gender dysphoria above the academic and emotional well-being of the dozens of girls who would rather not share a locker room or learn about puberty alongside biological boys.\nPresident Biden's new rule defeats the purpose of Title IX. By interpreting Title IX to be about protecting \"gender identity\" instead of physical gender, President Biden will place countless women and girls in uncomfortable—or even unsafe—learning environments.\nThe Biden administration is unperturbed. It dismissed the concerns of parents who don't want their daughters to share a bathroom with a biological man by denying that the \"mere presence of a transgender person in a single-sex space compromises anyone's legitimate privacy interest.\"\nPut down the bong.\nIt may be President Biden's belief that little girls do not have a legitimate privacy interest in only sharing restrooms with other women and girls, but common sense and most Americans disagree.\nThe Biden administration's Title IX rule will also require language restrictions, mandated by the federal government, on any teacher who wishes to use grammatically correct pronouns. Under the new rule, any teacher who refers to a little boy as \"he\" instead of \"they\" in a way that the federal government finds objectively offensive will trigger a lawsuit for discrimination. Grammar teachers might as well cancel the lesson on pronouns now.\nI have empathy for the small percentage of young people who suffer from gender dysphoria. Those students deserve to receive a quality education, too. We cannot, however, prioritize the comfort of a small set of gender dysphoric students over the safety, education and opportunities of all women and girls.\nTitle IX has protected women and girls for more than 50 years. President Biden ought to hide his head in a bag if he allows his administration to destroy decades of progress for women by turning Title IX into a weapon that his party can use to tear apart schools that don't support these anti-women gender policies.\nJohn Kennedy is a U.S. Senator from Louisiana.\nThe views expressed in this article are the writer's own.\n",

        "content": "Russia's military has adapted to the high losses of troops on the battlefield in Ukraine and it is likely to continue its tactic of throwing troops forward during offensives until the end of the war, according to British military officials.\nThe term \"meat grinder\" is used to describe Russia's tactic of sending waves of often ill-trained and ill-equipped soldiers to wear down Ukrainian forces and expose their locations to Russian artillery. Using this method, Russia's gains have been incremental but its forces have built on momentum following the capture of Avdiivka in the Donetsk oblast, albeit at a huge cost.\nAccording to Ukraine's latest figures released on Saturday, Russian forces suffered losses of more than 1,000 for the seventh day in a row, with the 1,260 casualties of both killed and wounded taking the war's total to 473,400.\nWhile an accurate count of Russian personnel losses is tricky to calculate, it is not far off the 465,000 estimate given on Saturday by the U.K. Ministry of Defense (MOD) which said casualties will increase again in May and June amid renewed offensive operations in the east of Ukraine. This follows \"a slight decrease in the pace of operations\" over the last two months, it added.\n\"It is likely that despite the extreme cost in life, Russia has fully adapted its military to attritional warfare which relies on mass over quality,\" the British officials said.\n\"This reliance on mass will almost certainly continue for the duration of the Ukraine war and have long-lasting effects on Russia's future army.\"\nNewsweek has contacted the Russian defense ministry for comment on the latest British daily assessment which tends to highlight Moscow's losses and Ukraine's gains.\nUkraine and the U.K.'s estimates of Russian casualties roughly chime with those given by France, whose foreign minister Stéphane Séjourne told independent outlet Novaya Gazyeta had reached 500,000, 150,000 of whom had been killed.\nRussia has not given any update to its tally of losses since it said in September 2022 that just under 6,000 troops had been killed.\nUkraine has not given an update of its losses since President Volodymyr Zelensky said in February that 31,000 of his troops had been killed. However, Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu said on Friday that Kyiv's troop losses had surpassed 111,000.\nMeanwhile, independent outlet Mediazona has been working with BBC News Russian service to compile the number of deaths of Russia's soldiers, drawing on publicly available information such as obituaries and online notices. Their latest figures revealed on April 26 that at least 51,679 Russian troops had been killed, although they emphasize the actual number of deaths was likely a lot higher.\n",

There were no fatalities, he said, adding that 30 homes and 10 cars were damaged, without offering any further information about the source of the blast.\nNewsweek has reached out to the Russian Defense Ministry for comment via email.\nRussian glide-bombs have rained down on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, in recent months. Across the front line, Moscow has used adapted Soviet-era bombs, fitting the munitions with guidance kits and wings, to strike targets.\nRussian jets fire the precision-guided bombs out of the range of Kyiv's air defenses, and they glide towards their target, often with devastating effect. Ukrainian officials in Kharkiv have reported several strikes, including those using guided aerial bombs, in recent days.\nLast month, footage appeared to show a 1,500-kilogram (3,300-pound) converted bomb landing on a Russian-controlled village in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, although the munition did not detonate. Separately in April, Russian independent media outlet Astra reported that Moscow had mistakenly dropped a Kh-59 missile on a village in the Belgorod region.\nIn January, Russia bombed the village of Petropavlovka, in the country's Voronezh region, by mistake. The defense ministry said at the time that there had been an \"abnormal discharge of aircraft ammunition\" over the village, state media reported. A few days later, a Moscow-installed official said one of its jets had accidentally dropped a FAB-250 bomb on Rubizhne, in Ukraine's annexed Luhansk region.\nIn April 2023, a Russian warplane accidentally bombed Belgorod, causing a huge crater and a large explosion in the city.\n",

I love the merch, love it all.\"\n\"I was honored to be asked to come to the White House to meet the most legislatively successful president of my lifetime,\" he continued. \"It just shows you, one person can be so influential and so positive in our lives.\"\nHamill went on to describe his visit with Biden as \"so amazing,\" while revealing that he had previously made shorter White House visits during the administrations of former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama.\nDespite having jokingly asked the reporters for \"no Star Wars questions, please,\" Hamill was then asked if Biden had mentioned the franchise during his visit.\n\"Well, you know, I called him 'Mr. President' and he said, 'You can call me Joe,'\" Hamill responded. \"I said, 'Can I call you Joe-bi Wan Kenobi?' He liked that.\"\nNewsweek reached out for comment to the White House via email on Friday evening.\nConservatives, perhaps predictably, reacted with disdain to the remarks from Hamill, an outspoken Democrat who frequently mocks former President Donald Trump on social media.\n\"WTF is Mark Hamill doing at the press briefing while the Marxists are burning down the country,\" conservative pundit and former Trump administration official Monica Crowley posted to X, formerly Twitter.\n\"Just when you think that the Biden Regime can't possibly be a bigger embarrassment, they rolled out washed up actor Mark Hamill to tell everyone not to believe your lying eyes, because Crooked Joe Biden is doing a great job,\" wrote @LangmanVince.\n\"Mark Hamill isn't right in the head,\" @MAGAMichelleS69 said.\nFriday was not the first time that Hamill has alluded to Star Wars for political purposes. In 2022, he signed up as an \"ambassador\" for Ukraine's United24 fundraising platform to bolster the country's \"Army of Drones\" program, while taking the opportunity to refer to Russia as the \"evil empire.\"\nPrior to the 2020 presidential election, Hamill compared Biden to Luke Skywalker, saying that \"the force is strong\" with the then-future president as he shared images of Biden spliced into Star Wars on X, then Twitter.\nFormer Trump campaign adviser Brad Parscale seemingly embraced the idea that Trump was part of the \"empire\" by comparing the Trump campaign to a Death Star, the gigantic weapon of mass destruction that appears in multiple Star Wars films.\nHamill has continued to regularly share pro-Biden and anti-Trump messages on X. This week, he has posted a series of political messages that appear to be in preparation for May 4—a special occasion for Star Wars fans who celebrate it as \"May the Fourth\" due to a resemblance to the film quote \"may the force be with you.\"\n\"May The First Not Quench Your Thirst For Biden's Re-election! #BidenHarris2024,\" Hamill posted on Wednesday.\n\"May The Second Biden Administration Be As Productive and Successful As The 1st,\" he continued on Thursday.\n\"May The Third Be Absurd That The Guy Who Tried To Steal A Fair Election Is Allowed To Run Again,\" reads Hamill's most recent post on Friday.\n",

The 46 year old stars as Heather Morris, the author behind the book the six-episode series is based on.\n\"In a way, it's a relief to not be fighting zombies or eating anyone,\" Lynskey told Newsweek, referencing her recent TV roles. \"But you know it was hard in its own ways. It is its own kind of challenge.\"\nLynskey finds it \"fun\" to play complicated women, but the Emmy nominee said portraying a real person came with \"a lot of responsibility.\"\n\"I just [wanted] her to be happy,\" Lynskey said. \"I [wanted] her to feel represented, and feel like she was seeing herself without [me] doing an impersonation of her, which would be so weird.\"\nRead more: Best Affordable Streaming Services\nAlthough she described the process as a \"balancing act,\" Lynskey discovered she could relate to Morris's sudden success in midlife.\nThe Tattooist of Auschwitz was Morris's debut novel, based on her real-life conversations with Holocaust survivor Ludwig (Lale) Sokolov—portrayed by Oscar nominee Harvey Keitel and The Little Mermaid actor Jonah Hauer-King in the show.\nWhile tasked with tattooing identification numbers onto the arms of other prisoners, Sokolov fell in love with a woman named Gita (Anna Próchniak), with Morris documenting their years-long struggle to be together.\nThe 2018 novel became an international bestseller, with Lynskey following a similar career journey. She landed her first movie role aged 17, starring alongside Kate Winslet in Peter Jackson's 1994 drama Heavenly Creatures.\nHer performance was praised by critics, but while Winslet headed to Hollywood, Lynskey preferred low-budget indie projects. This ensured she produced work she was proud of, but meant that few people outside of the industry knew her name.\nMainstream film and TV shows often relegated Lynskey to small parts, such as Reese Witherspoon's childhood friend in Sweet Home Alabama or as Charlie Sheen's stalker neighbor Rose in the early 2000 sitcom Two and a Half Men.\nLynskey left the role after two seasons due to a fear of only being seen as the show's \"wacky neighbor,\" despite Rose being her steadiest acting job to date. At the time, her agent called her \"crazy\" for turning down a spot as a series regular.\nHowever, Yellowjackets changed the game, making Lynskey a bonafide star as well as critically acclaimed. Lynskey stars as the adult version of Shauna in the Showtime series, a Surburban mom who survived a plane crash as a teenager and spent a year-and-a-half stranded in the Canadian wilderness. Her portrayal has led to multiple awards nominations across the show's two seasons, including an Emmy, a Satellite Award and an Independent Spirit gong.\n\"There is something about having led a relatively private life and then suddenly being a lot more public,\" Lynskey said.\n\"I think Heather took to it a lot more easily than I did. I'm still quite shy and awkward. You know people sort of recognize me and I feel like I'm in trouble, but she's great with people.\"\nRead more: Earn Cash Back for Streaming Services\nThere is another benefit to playing Morris—the New Zealand native gets to use her real voice for the role.\n\"It's always nice to get to use my own accent,\" she said. \"She's from Te Awamutu, which is a town that I know. It's incredible.\"\nStream The Tattooist of Auschwitz on Peacock from May 2.\n",

Newsweek approached Kensington Palace in London via email for comment.\nImages released by Kensington Palace have faced increased scrutiny following the Mother's Day scandal. Kate issued a public apology after traces of editing were identified in a portrait of herself and her three children taken by Prince William in Windsor, Berkshire, in England.\nThe photo was of particular importance as it was the first officially released of Kate since stepping out of the public eye to undergo abdominal surgery in January. She then said that at the time of the photo backlash she had been diagnosed with cancer and was undergoing a course of preventive chemotherapy.\nSince photo agencies issued \"kill\" notices to news agencies over the Mother's Day image, William and Kate have moved away from the traditional form of releasing royal celebration portraits to agencies ahead of events. For the birthday of Prince Louis and the couple's 13th wedding anniversary in April, images were released through the Wales' social-media channels. This was followed on May 2 by the birthday portrait of Princess Charlotte.\nIn the image, the princess is shown standing in an outdoor setting, smiling broadly and wearing a raspberry cardigan with denim skirt and blue blouse combination.\nFollowing the image's release, users on X (formerly Twitter) quickly highlighted that the cardigan, identified as being sourced from French fashion brand Cyrillus, was the same one that the princess was seen wearing in the controversial Mother's Day photo.\nThis sparked a wave of posts and speculation, ranging from claims that the image had been taken on the day of the Mother's Day image, despite reports saying it had been created in the days before its release, to fans suggesting Kate was \"trolling\" her critics with the reference.\nIn addition to Charlotte's cardigan, some users also highlighted that Prince Louis appeared to be wearing the same shirt he had done in the Mother's Day photo for his own birthday portrait released a month later.\n\"They must not have gotten any new clothes this year,\" wrote one X user, posting a photo highlighting the matches.\n\"Do these Royal children only own 1 set of clothes?\" posted another. \"Louis in the same shirt as the Mother's Day photo last week. Now, Charlotte in the same cardigan and ruffled neck shirt (albeit a \"different\" color shirt) as the Mother's Day photo. WHY does this keep happening?\"\nIn response, fans of the royal jumped to her defense. \"She is trolling the trolls and I'm here for it,\" wrote on user of Kate in a post with over 70,000 views.\n\"That Mother's Day photo controversy started with Charlotte's cardigan sleeve. Now Catherine is making a point that, this picture isn't altered. She's messing with all the doubting Thomas's [people questioning her] out there,\" wrote another. This is a reference to the fact that one of the editing traces spotted in the Mother's Day image occurred around Charlotte's sleeve.\nFollowing Kate's apology—issued a day after the Mother's Day photo was released, which said \"like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing\"—neither the princess nor Kensington Palace has directly addressed the photo or the scandal surrounding it.\nJames Crawford-Smith is Newsweek's royal reporter, based in London.

In the ensuing months of war, more than 34,500 people have died in Gaza and about 80 percent of the population has been displaced, according to the latest figures from the Associated Press.\nMorgan and his guests were talking about the pro-Palestinian protests at college campuses around the United States which have led to hundreds of arrests. Morgan spoke about Jewish students at the colleges who had allegedly been harassed by the protesters.\n\"All you wanna talk about is the Jewish students,\" West told Morgan, insisting he should focus on Israel's actions in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis it has caused. \"Then, in fact, you become an extension of propaganda, and that's why I call you a racist because it means then that Palestinian lives do not have the same value as an Israeli life.\"\nMorgan snapped, \"How dare you?\" to West, refuting his accusations of racism.\n\"How dare you call me a racist. What you don't know is before I did this debate, I did a long interview with one of the IDF spokesmen in which I went after him about their planned invasion of Rafah because I think it would be a catastrophic mistake.

But it should be possible to believe that, and to condemn the horrifying terror attacks on Israel on Oct 7,\" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter, almost three weeks after Hamas' attack.\nHis coverage of the war has proved divisive, though.\n\"The person covering Palestine-Israel best is ... Piers Morgan?\" asked Aymann Ismail in a column for Slate.\n\"Morgan's approach seems simple enough: have on the program as many people from as wide an array of opinions as possible, and let them make their case to him on the air,\" wrote Ismail. \"He gives each guest a considerable amount of airtime too, some stretching beyond 30 minutes—which may not sound like a lot until you compare it to other segments on broadcast news, which rarely surpass a few minutes before moving on.\"\nIsmail continued: \"At a time when social media bubbles often exacerbate polarization and misinformation, Morgan's seemingly sincere commitment to fostering meaningful dialogue stands out.\"\nBut Mohamad Elmasry, a professor of Media Studies at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies does not agree.\n\"The British talk show host deserves credit for featuring pro-Palestinian voices, but interview successes are owed mostly to the talent of his guests refuting his Israeli talking points,\" he wrote for the Middle East Eye in November.\n\"It is probably true that he has given more space for Palestine supporters than anyone else in mainstream western media,\" Elmasry wrote, but \"Morgan has not been nearly as balanced or fair as he implies, however.\"\nElmasry argued that Morgan seemed more likely to push back on pro-Palestinian guests while giving \"softball\" questions to those who were pro-Israeli.\n",

A happy looking, successful, and beautiful couple turned into a sham.\nI recall praying. I recall crying. I recall the decision to call the clinic and make an appointment to terminate the pregnancy. I called my mom and gained her support. I distinctly remember it was my choice.\nI did not consult my partner on the topic at all. Some regrets live on, and some don't. This was one that didn't. I simply was not going to get myself into any situation that would force me to be dependent on or intertwined with him. I couldn't trust him with anything. I certainly could not depend on him to be a father, and I was not going to do it myself.\nAs I walked into the clinic in Dallas, they were holding an anti-abortion rally outside its doors. I saw them approaching the young, scared, soon-to-be mothers entering and engaging them in persuasive conversation.\nNot me. I stood tall, was dressed in business clothes, and walked through that crowd like I was going on a sales call. Confident, scared to the root of my soul, ashamed, assured my decision was accurate. I'm pretty certain none of them expected a 44-year-old client.\nOnce inside, I was at peace. The waiting room was full of such young, scared girls. Some sat with their boyfriends, others with mothers or sisters, and some alone, just like me. I realized as we sat there waiting for our names to be called that we all had such different paths and stories that had led us to the exact same point. I somehow found peace in that.\nMy name was called, and I slipped into my gown. All the nurses were so kind and gentle and soft-spoken. The furniture, beds, and clinic were threadbare and reminiscent of the 1950s. But to me, it felt like a comfortable old blanket. Like grandma's house. Not fancy, but spotless and full of love and peace. I felt comfortable, safe, and unjudged.\nThe realization of seeing the tiny heartbeat and having the nurse assure me that I was, in fact, six weeks along was surreal. I could identify the night of conception. Oddly, I recalled thinking at the time that we should have used birth control that night. I had let my guard down.\nNext, the doctor came in. He was in his sixties and looked like he was tired of fighting the daily fight to perform procedures that are firmly protected by our constitution in 2007. He asked me why I was thinking about an abortion.\nI explained that I did not have a partner who gave two cents about me, how much I loved my career, and how I could not afford to give my job up to raise this child. I told him I had three beautiful adult sons, and that I was done with the child-rearing time in my life. I told him I had based my decision on logic, knowledge, and not fear.\nWhile recuperating in this warm, dark, soft, music-playing wardroom, I felt at peace. Nestled into my blankies alone with my thoughts, I knew I had made the right decision. Six hours later, I got up, got dressed, and walked out the door into the same crowd I'd walked past seven hours earlier.\nThey now knew. I knew they knew. Again, I strode past them, head high, my eyes up, confident that I had taken control of the rights of women to own their own bodies. Even now, as I write this as a reborn Christian, I do not know if I would have made a different choice.\nThat was my path—the same path that led me to Christ and the same Christ-driven path I am on today. Judge me. Applaud me. Pray for me. Cry for me. The choice is yours—just as the choice was mine.\nI do not believe abortion is birth control to be abused, but it should be an option. I believe women take on 100 percent of the responsibility for carrying a child and 70-90 percent of the care. There are great fathers out there who break that mold, but holistically, I believe that it is the mothers who raise the babies a lot of the time.\nIt seems impossible to believe that male birth control pills have not been invented to share the responsibility, but they haven't. When we find ourselves pregnant, we must act fast and trust our instincts.\nI believe that if a woman is pregnant, she alone may choose her destiny. Roe vs. Wade was signed into place to protect women in need of medical choices. With it being revoked in a number of states, we are casting shame on women needlessly as they franticly search out council facilities to end pregnancies.\nI am not justifying murder, but I am not doomed to eternal damnation because I sought an abortion. As a Christian, I believe that all sins are heinous, and all sins can be erased with Christ's mercy. If He didn't die for all sins, then his sacrifice on the cross was futile.\nMotherhood is a destiny and an honor. I would advise women to prayerfully decide when it is their turn to be mothers and to prayerfully make their own decisions.\nJoanne Richardson is President of Gailwinds Group LLC.

        "content": "In the winter of 1969, during the frigid spring semester at the University of Minnesota, a coalition of Black students staged a sit-in protest at Morrill Hall, occupying the office of the bursar and records for almost twenty-four hours.\nLed by Afro-American Action Committee (AAAC) President Rosemary Freeman, a sophomore, and one of only eighty-seven Black students on a campus of 40,000, the organization had communicated their grievances and demands for institutional changes several times previously.\nFreeman was originally from Browning, Mississippi, an all-Black community created by a group of ex-slaves shortly after the Civil War. She first came to activism as a high school student working to register Black voters in the south under Martin Luther King Jr. She'd been previously jailed for her participation in voter registration and was therefore no stranger to contentious political situations.\nThe assassinations of Dr. King and then Robert Kennedy in 1968 intensified the AAAC's desire to call the university to action. Among other things, they wanted the institution to foster diversity on campus via scholarships for local Black high school students and the creation of an African American Studies department.\nUniversity of Minnesota President Malcolm Moos, previously radio silent in response to the committee's outreach, negotiated a common ground to end the protest by the deadline. And thanks to the action of the AAAC, an African American Studies department was created and the university opened its doors more readily to local Black talent.\nIn February 2019, the University's Department of African American and African Studies celebrated the fiftieth reunion of the protest with teach-ins at the student union, the first time for a public reckoning of the events of 1969.\nRosemary Freeman, along with John Wright, Horace Huntley, and Warren Tucker Jr., are rarely known. As the AAAC president and, as she tells it, the one who leveled the playing field between herself and President Moos by greeting him in his own office chair during negotiations, Freeman's involvement is often glossed over in the scant number of available retellings.\nWhen I started my doctoral work in the sociology department at the University of Minnesota almost exactly forty years after the Morrill Hall Takeover (as it has come to be known), I'd never heard the story, nor did I understand the legacy of Freeman's leadership.\nWhich stories get told impact who is able to feel empowered by them. The erasure of Black women's stories weakens our understanding and connection to the legacy of Black women's accomplishments and dims the possibility of our collective strength.\nFifteen years before the Morrill Hall Takeover, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), working with Black families around the country, brought local lawsuits against counties across the South after being blocked from enrolling their children, mostly Black girls, into segregated white schools, culminating in the landmark Supreme Court case that legalized educational desegregation.\nThe stories of coordinated legal action are rarely heard, silencing the voices of all those other families who sacrificed themselves for the integration fight but whose names are absent from historical narratives on the issue.\nBrown v. Board of Education has been watered down to focus on one little girl, Linda Brown, wiping away what was actually a long-term, strategic plan between the NAACP, more than a dozen families, and the students themselves. This organized erasure of complex political protests organized in Black communities maintains perceptions of our ineptness in political organizing.\nIt is not a coincidence that girls and women (often mothers and teachers) led the fight for school desegregation. Black girls learn early in life that they will be expected to be poised and strong-willed in the face of danger and degradation.\nThe girls on the front lines of desegregation were physically and psychologically attacked, ignored, or otherwise pushed to their limits at school. In response, their voices were their weapons.\nThey utilized silence when deliberately provoked and spoke up in classes where teachers ignored their signals to participate voluntarily. They endured, sure, but they also made waves.\nSo much of the work of political organizing and protest has been concentrated among Black girls, in schools. But to highlight our skills of organization and execution of activism is to magnify our strengths, so the strategy and forethought of Black activism must be repackaged as insignificant or nonexistent. I didn't know my own connections to the desegregation movement until recently, which is perhaps to say I didn't know my strength.\nThree years after the Brown v. Board of Education decision, The Little Rock Nine, nine Black students—six girls and three boys—enrolled at the all-white Little Rock Central High School just a few blocks from where my mother lived with her family in Arkansas.\nJust a toddler at the time, my mother and her siblings were often under the care of fifteen-year-old, Carlotta (Walls) LaNier, the youngest of the Little Rock Nine attempting to integrate the local high school and the first Black woman to graduate from Little Rock Central High School.\nCarlotta was my family's regular babysitter; she was also on the front lines of American desegregation. She, along with her eight classmates, withstood the racial slurs and threats of physical violence in the name of education. She also paid a heavy price.\nAfter her graduation, the Walls family was forced to relocate to Colorado to find work and avoid the backlash caused by Carlotta's participation in the equal education fight. Ms. LaNier was a woman I'd never heard directly linked to my family until recently, when I made the decision to uncover her story as a part of ours.\nHistory, as a discipline and a social construct, does not view women, especially Black women, as historical actors. Despite our accomplishments, what we do is not often chronicled as \"real\" history. This is as true at Vassar as at any other HWSCU. In 1969 and again in 1990, Black students protested on campus and occupied buildings to demand fair treatment and increased support structures for Black students.\nIn 1969, thirty-four Black women undergrads took over the main building in the early morning hours, a result of detailed tactical planning, which allowed them to take over the switchboard with relative ease. They remained for three days until then President Alan Simpson responded to their demands.\nIn February 1990, a group of Black students again staged a sit-in at the main building, this time to protest the hiring of Daniel Patrick Moynihan—a white Republican sociologist infamous for his racist theories about the status of Black communities—as a distinguished lecturer at the college.\nMoynihan quit his post as a result of the protests. Recollection of the events is captured in the Vassar Encyclopedia, but you won't hear discussions of their organization on campus or about the improvements made as a result of their efforts.\nThere aren't photos capturing their occupation of Main Hall hung alongside those pictures of almost two hundred years of white students that serve as a visual history of the place. There are no anniversary celebrations or well-kept archives of what these students were fighting against or what they achieved. Their stories are functionally lost from the general history of the college.\nBlack students continue standing on the front lines of protests against police brutality and racism on college campuses across the country. They are being jailed, threatened, and vilified but also ignored in favor of the mainstream appeal of white student activists when the topic is appropriately \"non-racial.\"\nOn college campuses, Black students are challenging their \"othered\" status in ways I never thought possible. Conservatives often perpetuate the false narrative that colleges are places where hyper-liberal professors hijack students' minds with impractical, politically correct ideals. In reality, my students, mostly Black women, come to me not initially looking to protest.\nThey want to belong, to be the proverbial Vassar girls their white counterparts are offered the chance to become. And they are frustrated that the promises of higher education don't seem to apply to them.\nWe are not so different, my students and me. Protest is a last resort, a desperate act from groups of people without access to conventional support, but also with limited information about the activism of their forbearers.\nThese Black women want an education free from all the trappings of white supremacy that limit their potential. I didn't protest when I probably should've. I didn't recognize my connections to Black women activists and disruptors of the past, but they were there to be heard. And so, I try to pass down these stories, as bits of wisdom from the ancestors, that I wish I'd had.\nThis is an adapted excerpt from Black Women, Ivory Tower: Revealing the Lies of White Supremacy in American Education (Broadleaf Books, 2024).

        "content": "In 2013, I rented my first apartment, wrote my first resume, and eventually started my first (minimum-wage) job. I was 25 years old, inexperienced, and completely uneducated in how to be an independent woman.\nI had just left the Christian patriarchy movement, where I had been a stay-at-home daughter, living the Quiverfull lifestyle exhibited by the Duggar family.\nSince I hadn't been allowed to have a job outside the home, the only way I could make money was by teaching piano lessons, mostly to other homeschool families. And since I wasn't allowed to go to college, I studied piano pedagogy textbooks on my own to learn how to be a better teacher.\nI became resourceful despite my restrictions, and that's how I eventually escaped and started my life over, as I've written about in my new book, Rift: A Memoir of Breaking Away from Christian Patriarchy.\nI thought I had left that oppressive world behind, but now, more than a decade later, I see the #tradwife trend on social media, and it's bringing everything back—the glorification of traditional gender roles that were never as shiny as they appear with photo filters and curated vintage clothing.\nScrolling through TikTok, I see videos of women in long floral dresses. Their hair is perfectly curled, and they are cooking or gardening or creating crafts for their children. One thing is a constant: They are always at home.\nThese videos use the hashtag #tradwife, \"trad\" standing for \"traditional.\" And while this nickname is new, the content is not. In fact, it's deeply familiar to me as someone who was raised to become a traditional wife.\nBut the stay-at-home life is not as glamorous as it looks on TikTok and Instagram.\nBack in the 1990s and early 2000s, when I was being homeschooled and taught the beliefs of \"biblical patriarchy,\" we didn't have the term \"tradwife,\" and I likely wouldn't have been allowed to watch TikTok videos anyway.\n\"Traditional marriage,\" \"biblical womanhood,\" and \"Quiverfull\" were the terms we most often used to describe our lifestyle, which was founded on Christian fundamentalism.\nChristian or biblical patriarchy is an ideology and religious movement centered around the idea that God is masculine, the ultimate patriarch, which is why men were \"created\" to be leaders in the home, church, and government.\nWomen were called to be homemakers, submitting to their fathers until they married, when they would then submit to their husbands. Men and women had to conform to strictly distinct gender roles.\nAs a homeschooled kid, I was taught many typical subjects, or at least given books about them, but my focus was to grow up and become a stay-at-home wife and mother. I became proficient in cooking, sewing, and cleaning.\nAnything I was taught was framed as something I could use to benefit my future family. Learning math was so that I could help my future husband do his taxes. Learning to play piano was so I could accompany hymn singing.\nI was allowed to skip science one year because it wasn't \"necessary.\"\nWhen I turned 18, I didn't go to college or get a job. I was called a \"stay-at-home daughter\" because I was in training to be a wife. My father told me that I didn't need an education or a career because it wouldn't help me in my calling and would tempt me away from God's righteous path.\nHomemaking was glorified as the ideal calling for women. Instead of video-sharing apps, we had Vision Forum catalogs where gender-specific toys were sold and glossy photographs of girls in frilly dresses and boys in Colonial hunting garb were shown to create an aesthetic of \"the good old days\" when men and women had separate gender roles. Books like So Much More and The Excellent Wife and magazines like Above Rubies and Patriarch extolled this lifestyle as one of beauty and divine purpose.\nSo watching #tradwife content is hauntingly familiar to me. These are not new ideas. It is the same old patriarchy wearing a different dress.\nJust like some of these creators say in their videos, I was also told this lifestyle was a choice, that I wasn't being forced into it. At the same time, I was restricted from outside information, prohibited from going to college, and not allowed to have a job outside the home.\nTheoretically, I could have moved out and chosen my own path, but as someone with limited life skills and insufficient finances, I had no idea how to actually do that when I turned 18.\nNot to mention that going against these gender restrictions would have been \"sinful\" and \"ungodly,\" marking me as an outsider to my family and church. So, even though I was \"choosing\" to be a stay-at-home daughter, I didn't really have any other option.\nToday, when I hear content creators sharing about how they choose to stay home and then say they submit to their husbands in the same video, I understand the dynamics at play behind the scenes.\nThe very concept of submission is that you are giving up your decision-making to someone else. If you \"choose\" to be a stay-at-home wife and give up all financial independence, you are placing yourself in a position where you won't have any choice in the future.\nThese videos are known for their ultra-feminine clothing and cozy cooking tutorials, but underlying many of them is a more disturbing ideology: That a woman is fulfilling her God-given purpose if she is a traditional wife who stays home and submits to her husband.\nAdding the promise of divine blessing to a lifestyle choice makes it more of a command than an act of true consent.\nOne #tradwife content creator named Estee recently shared a video of advice for high school girls who want to become traditional wives one day. \"Stay home as long as you possibly can,\" she says.\nShe goes even further by saying: \"If you want to be a traditional wife in the future, you don't need to go to college.\" In another video, Estee says women don't need prenups if they marry the right man because they can trust him not to betray the relationship. Instead, prayer is the best safeguard against divorce.\nAnother content creator named Jasmine Dinis says in one video that she is teaching her young daughter \"it's perfectly acceptable to depend on a man...that serving her husband and bearing children will be her greatest joy.\" Another video of hers proclaims, \"I used to be really into politics but now I just relax while my husband tells me what to think.\"\nThese words are so familiar that they trigger long-ago memories of being indoctrinated to believe that my only purpose was to be a wife and mother who didn't \"need\" a job or independent thoughts.\nAs I was in my twenties, unmarried and waiting for my father to help me find the perfect husband, I became deeply depressed and felt purposeless.\nServing men didn't bring me true happiness or fulfillment. I wanted to be my own person, but that would have gone directly against the mission to make me a submissive wife.\nAnd I had witnessed many women getting married and having extremely difficult lives as homemakers. They struggled with poverty, impossible expectations, domestic abuse, lack of bodily autonomy, burnout, and shame.\nAbove all, their lack of choice and true agency kept them trapped in unhealthy marriages.\nAnd while the #tradwife trend is fascinating to watch and even aesthetically pleasing for viewers who crave a slower lifestyle, it points to a deeper misogyny in our culture and a dangerous shift toward authoritarianism in American politics, one where women are encouraged to stay home, men are made to be the sole providers, and girls grow up believing they will be better off not having any real decision-making power in their lives.\nGirls like me.\nBut I know change is possible. I found a way to escape, and I will never willingly give up my agency for anyone.\nI'm sharing my story to prevent this kind of suffering in others because while being a stay-at-home [fill in the blank] is a valid choice for many, giving up your agency to submit to a spouse can lead to devastating consequences.\nWhen I tell girls they can be whoever they want, I'm really saying those words to myself, because after decades of being made to feel like I could only be a helpmate, I still need reminding that I have a voice.\nCait West is a writer and editor based in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

        "content": "I felt like I was on top of the world. I was married to my loving husband and together, we had an amazing 17-month-old son whom we both adored. My dream of having kids close in age was about to become a reality, and I was so excited to learn that I was pregnant with my second child.\nAfter my first healthy, stress-free pregnancy, I couldn't wait for my son to have a little sister or brother. My husband, Eli, jumped up and down with joy when we saw the pregnancy test was positive.\nIn the back of my head, I knew that miscarriage was a possibility, but I didn't believe it could happen to me.\nAnd then it did.\nWhen I was eight weeks pregnant, I had my first ultrasound. I was told that my baby had a strong heartbeat. I brought up that I had some light spotting, but the doctor told me not to worry.\n\"Don't worry,\" she said. \"That's normal. It happens.\"\nI breathed a sigh of relief, but I wasn't entirely convinced. My gut feeling turned out to be right.\nI lightly bled for two weeks straight. When the blood suddenly became darker and redder, I reached out to my doctor's office to make an appointment.\nI thought my concerns would be met with care and urgency from my medical team. Instead, I had almost entirely the opposite reaction from those whose help I desired most.\nInsensitive receptionists, limited doctor appointments, and entire days where none of the eight to 10 doctors in practice were in the office, were just a few of the unexpected and stressful challenges I dealt with. It all made my horrifying experience infinitely worse.\nI finally got a follow-up appointment, the morning my husband was leaving for a five-day work trip. He had attended every single doctor's appointment until then.\nI'll never forget the look of pity on the doctor's face as she told me the bad news. Despite having a beating heart, my baby was missing a brain, and I was likely going to miscarry. I would have to wait and see what my body decided to do with the defective fetus.\nEli's flight was delayed, so I was able to catch him before he departed. Eli couldn't even comprehend the news himself, as he was chaperoning his high school boys' softball team for a tournament and had absolutely nobody to speak to about his own sense of loss and the guilt of being away from his wife, who was suffering greatly.\nAs an Orthodox Jew, I faced another level of complication: my cramps worsened over the Sabbath when I couldn't use technology, including making phone calls.\nThere are exceptions if one's life is in danger, but while I was in a whole lot of pain I wasn't sure if it qualified as a life-threatening situation. I sought advice from my next-door neighbor, who threatened to call the doctor herself if I didn't.\nI'm really glad I opened up to someone with a more rational way thinking. It allowed me to remove the stress of wondering if there was anything else I should have been doing.\nWhen I woke up on the final day of my husband being away, I experienced the worst cramps yet. So when I saw a giant, fetus-sized clump of blood in the toilet, I froze completely and had no idea what to do.\nMy instinct was to cover it up as soon as possible. My hand shot out and I immediately flushed it. Not having Eli or someone else more rational than I at that moment was horrifying.\nOf course, this was also one of the days when no doctors were available because the office was moving. I sobbed to multiple receptionists for help, pleading for an ultrasound to see if my whole saga was over.\nBy a stroke of luck, my ultrasound technician happened to pass by one of the kinder receptionists and overheard that I was asking to see someone. She advocated for me and ordered me to come in right away. I am forever grateful to have had one medical angel who was concerned, and showed me the empathy I needed in that moment.\nWhen my husband came home, he was finally able to absorb all that happened and let out his emotions. We gave ourselves some time and grace to mourn the loss.\nI was ultimately able to get pregnant again. I gave birth to a healthy baby girl 10 months later, and one more daughter 5 years later.\nLooking back on my experience, I was surprised that the internet was lacking in relatable content about miscarriages. Other than a few articles and clinical websites, it had nothing that comforted me when I was up way too late in the middle of the night, searching for something, anything, that could tell me how I would survive losing my fetus, as well as so many of my hopes and dreams with it.\nI was under the false impression that people don't talk about miscarriages, since traditionally we don't talk about pregnancies until after the first trimester. I tried to be strong all by myself, but it became very clear I had no idea how to comprehend all of my emotions and physical pains.\nI didn't want any woman who had gone through a miscarriage to feel alone like I did. So I drew what I went through, creating a short comic about my story called, \"Miscarried.\" Actress, Mayim Bialik, also a mother, helped me launch the comic publicly and the feedback was incredible.\nI started getting emails from people all over the world who related to my story and were glad to find that they weren't in this alone. I ended up making a video out of my comic to reach more people. It's launching in May.\nAs awful as my experience was, I'm thankful that I was able to share it. While the world has certainly made some progress in discussing miscarriages and other complications regarding childbirth, there's still a long way to go.\nI hope that by telling my story through my comics, I can help others feel less alone in their struggle and help women understand that sometimes miscarriages, though terrible, can be a natural part of life, and that nothing is wrong with women who miscarry.\nIt's 2024. Nobody should be suffering alone. I want to make sure of that.\nChari Pere, creator of Miscarried: An Unspoken Cartoonmentary, worked as a creative director and illustrator/storyboard artist on projects for Red Bull, Jockey, Disney, Comedy Central, and Bud Light.

        "content": "September 29, 2018, started out as an ordinary day, but ended in a tragedy of twisted metal and pain. I was leaving a friend's house just after 11:00 p.m. and had only made it a few miles when a drunk person driving a truck crossed into my lane and crashed into me at 55 miles per hour, pushing my SUV off the road and into a ditch.\nI often think about what would have happened if I decided to stay longer or leave earlier. Would I still be where I am today? Would the driver crash into someone else instead? I've tried to let these questions go because I cannot change my circumstances and I would not wish that another person had been hurt instead of me.\nAfter the crash occurred, emergency services arrived at the scene and cut me out of my vehicle to put me in a helicopter where I was then taken to the nearest hospital.\nI do not remember much from the crash but I have been burdened with PTSD which makes driving and being a passenger extremely hard. I had various surgeries that repaired my ribs, legs, neck, and lungs. To this day, I still having chronic pain and stress from the events that occurred that day.\nThis whole experience has not only affected me, but those around me also. I may appear like most women my age, but I must face daily unnecessary struggles that I did not ask for. Due to the rate of speed and the type of impact caused, my body will never be the same.\nThe trauma surgeons saved my life that night by putting me back together with hardware in my neck, femur, tibia, foot, and ribs. The impact also caused one of my eyes to cross, which left me with a visual impairment.\nThe most severe injury I had was an Atlanto-occipital dislocation, which in basic terms is an internal decapitation where the skull separates from the spine. I still remember opening my eyes and feeling utter panic while in the hospital. With limited range of motion in my neck and shoulder, driving again was a challenge. I've had to depend on blind spot monitoring in my new vehicle as well as special mirrors.\nDriving while drunk is 100 percent preventable, with so much advancement in technology, people have options to get home safely and should be using them. I have learned from this tragedy that there are good people in life that want to help.\nI found a bigger purpose by sharing my story with MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) to help other survivors and Law Enforcement. There's a great reward for turning my pain into something that might help others. Lastly, I have learned to be grateful for the good days and allow myself grace when my body is in severe pain, when I can't do the things I want or need to do. I believe that we are connected through painful times and I've found ways to look for blessings in this burden.\nStephanie Ronan is an internal decapitation survivor. She volunteers with MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving), and uses her social media platforms to tell her story.\nAll views expressed are the author's own.\nDo you have a unique experience or personal story to share?

From a man's point of view.\"\nLora responded: \"Nah. Nah. I don't care.\"\nThe man, who is off-camera, said sarcastically: \"That's a good attitude,\" to which she replied: \"That's why I'm wearing it. But thanks for your input.\"\nThere has been a huge response to the video, which you can watch here, and Lora told Newsweek the interaction made her \"really angry.\"\n\"We'd just turned on the mic to do a sound check for some street interviews and then it happened,\" she said.\n\"It made me really angry as I was minding my own business and he just thought he could come and say that to me. Shows more what he was thinking about I think. It was only a normal denim skirt that loads of people wear!\"\nAnd it's not the first time men have given unwanted comments on her looks, she revealed.\n\"I've done hair modeling and I've had men comment on my hair about how they don't like it and 'why would I do that to myself,'\" she said.\nShe went on: \"Unfortunately I don't think things will change, it seems to be so common and it's sad.\"\nFounder and executive director of Stop Street Harassment, Holly Kearl, previously told Newsweek that there is no \"right\" way to deal with harassers.\n\"Every situation and person are different and often a person only has a second or two to assess their safety and decide what to do,\" she said. \"Whatever people choose in that second as their response is fine.\"\nShe urged caution however, as \"many harassers are trying to exert power and if they feel threatened by the response, they may escalate.\"\nWhile Lora is based in Birmingham in the U.K., in the United States, one in three women and approximately one in nine men have experienced sexual harassment in a public place, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nLora has received some major support from some commenters on her video, such as one user who wrote: \"Perfect response, hopefully he thinks twice about giving his unsolicited opinion next time!\"\n\"I think 'nah' was the perfect response,\" another user wrote, while one said: \"Nah. Nah. Love it.\" Another commented: \"Well said!\"\nBut some accused her of wanting \"attention\" or even faking the video, though Lora was quickly defended by other users in the comments.\nLora told Newsweek: \"I get a bit of hate on some of my videos as I do street interviews, so to get some support is really nice. We need to stick together and lift each other up rather than bring each other down.\"\nSharing some advice, she urged people to \"stay safe and always be careful.\"\n\"Keep your phones on you and make sure people know where you are if you're alone. All my friends have my location on their phones, I have theirs, all for safety,\" she said.\nSpecialists from the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN) sexual assault hotline are available 24/7 via phone (1 (800) 656-4673) and online chat.

Can you tell?\" Before adding: \"This cracked me up. I appreciate his level of concern and how much he cares.\"\nDespite being in good health now, when Rosie first came to live with the couple, she did have some health issues: \"She was having irregular toileting behaviors and while I was at work one day, Braiden noticed she had peed on one of our white blankets—Rosie had blood in our urine,\" Cody told Newsweek. \"He called me frantically and I told him to take her to the emergency vet.\"\nRosie was found to have a severe blockage in her urinary tract, and was prescribed pain medication and antibiotics.\nNow doing much better, it is no surprise Braiden is keeping a close eye on their beloved pet.\n\"That screenshot of the 'nipple' confusion was from March,\" Cody explained. \"Braiden was still anxious about her health and was keeping a very close eye on her. Hence the reason he was worried about her nipple.\"\nWhen Cody showed the interaction to her colleagues, they cracked up instantly, and she wanted to share the laughter with others.\nOn Reddit, people were in stitches: \"I'm laughing but I'm glad he cares. Seems like you got a good dude there,\" said one commenter.\nWhile another wrote: \"I once took my cat to the vet and had to be informed that the lump I was freaking out about was her rib. Paid through the nose just to be informed she's got bones.\"\nEarlier this year another cat owner shared how she paid over $100 when she found an unusual lump on her cat—only to be told it was her belly button.\nCody was delighted by the attention the post got on Reddit: \"A few comments mentioned how they needed a laugh like this. That was awesome to hear,\" she said. \"I wouldn't say I was all surprised it got the attention it did, because Braiden has this natural sense of humor and goodness about him that is hard to ignore.\"\nDo you have funny and adorable videos or pictures of your pet you want to share?

Since her video was posted on April 11, it has received 1.1 million views, over 111,000 likes and over 840 comments.\n\"There is nothing more superior than having your significant other leave in the morning before you, and you get to stay in bed,\" Napolitano said in the video. \"They're like, 'Bye,' and you just get to stay in bed. Like, why is that so superior? I feel like this is extremely toxic of me, but I love it.\"\nNapolitano told Newsweek that her work-from-home lifestyle allows her more time to relax in the mornings than her boyfriend, who exercises first thing—sometimes as early as 5 a.m.\n\"I love it,\" Napolitano said. \"I love seeing him push himself, and that he loves to just let me chill... I'm not a morning person, so I just love the few extra hours to lay in bed and relax before getting my day started.\"\nNapolitano said she has a constant appreciation for this set-up, especially since it hasn't always been the case: \"In previous relationships, I was the one getting up first and leaving to go to work, and I hated it,\" she added. \"I was out the door at 6 a.m. and he was in bed until 1 p.m., which made for a very difficult dynamic.\"\nWhen asked what she does on the weekends when nobody is determined to exercise at 5 a.m., Napolitano said she enjoys longer morning rituals with her boyfriend.\n\"My favorite morning rituals with my boyfriend are having coffee together and walking the dog together,\" she said. \"On the weekends, we do this and get a coffee outside with no phones, which I love. We always follow it up with a workout, either Pilates or a run.\"\nViewers in the comments could equally resonate with both the \"stay in bed girlfriend\" and the early-rising partner.\n\"Literally, getting to sprawl out and have the whole bed to yourself again is the best,\" @mackenzie.steen wrote.\n\"I go first and I'm mad about it every single day,\" @alyssasantostefano posted.\nHowever, some are saying life can get even better than Napolitano describes.\n\"Superior is when you have to leave first, but your boyfriend still wakes up with you and packs your lunch, and makes you coffee,\" @legal_marinara commented.\n",

The National Coffee Association reported in 2022 that Americans drank about 517 million cups of coffee daily, and the stimulating drink had become increasingly popular among people ages 18 to 24.\nOhlson said she felt like she had no choice but to eliminate caffeine from her diet after noticing several side effects, including eye twitches and gut problems.\n\"Since quitting caffeine, I wake up with more energy. I don't feel the need to drink a coffee first thing in the morning,\" Ohlson said. \"I feel more focused and at ease throughout the day.\"\n\"I had a constant eye twitch and always felt on edge,\" Ohlson said of the effects caffeine had on her. \"Along with anxiety, I noticed gut problems—even when hydrating and eating before consumption—inflammation and acne, and heightened premenstrual syndrome symptoms, such as mood swings, and cramps.\"\nShe added: \"I wanted to feel and look my healthiest. So I decided to see how I would feel without caffeine.\"\nAccording to Johns Hopkins Medicine, coffee has numerous advantages, including increasing vitality and preventing serious illnesses, such as Parkinson's and heart failure. However, it's not the greatest option for anxious individuals.\nAmy Baertschi, a registered dietitian, spoke with Newsweek about the links between coffee and anxiety.\n\"It's important to remember that caffeine is a central nervous stimulant and will raise heart rate, blood pressure, and may cause heart palpitations if consumed in higher doses,\" said Baertschi, who lives in Zurich.\nShe continued: \"For people with preexisting anxiety, adding something that will exacerbate the symptoms of anxiety (such as heart palpitations or increased heart rate) will only make symptoms worse.\"\nDuring the TikTok video, which has received more than 101,000 views and 12,000 likes, Ohlson said quitting caffeine \"cured\" her. She added that she was mentally in a better place and that her skin had \"never been this clear and this glowy.\"\nShe told Newsweek: \"I am a beverage girl. I love waking up and drinking a coffee or juice. The hardest part of giving up caffeine was losing the ritual of it.\"\nAccording to the CDC, three to five cups of plain coffee is OK as part of a healthy diet. Ohlson said she replaced coffee with water that contained electrolytes—though she hasn't ruled out the odd latte as a \"treat.\"\nShe said: \"I also remind myself that everything in moderation is important. I still love coffee, so I opt for decaf when I am craving one. However, I have treated myself to two lattes since March.\n\"Overall, my mental health has been better, and I no longer struggle with horrible anxiety. Of course, I have my day, but when I am anxious, I feel like I have more control and can deal with it a lot easier.\"\nIn the video's comments section, TikTok users shared their experiences quitting caffeine or moderating their intake.\n\"I stopped drinking caffeine on an empty stomach (I knew it was bad for me) and omg my anxiety lessened SO MUCH,\" one user wrote.\n\"Ughhh I'm moody without caffeine I want to but I can't,\" another added.\nA commenter said: \"I did the same thing!!!

        "content": "A mom has shared footage of her 5-year-old son eating a chicken nugget for the first time, saying it represents a significant breakthrough for her family.\nFor most families, a trip to Chick-fil-A is nothing to write home about. But it's different for Emily Marie Losier and son Dax, who live in Pennsylvania. Dax has autism spectrum disorder and struggles with what his mom terms \"extreme food aversion.\"\n\"Dax has a very sensitive gag reflex,\" Losier told Newsweek. \"So if he has it in his mind that he doesn't like something, no matter how it tastes, he will just throw up. I learned that lesson by trying to 'make' him taste something one time and one time only.\"\nLosier said Dax first started to refuse certain foods when he was 2. \"He would literally cover his hand with his mouth and from food he didn't want to try,\" she said. Instead, he insists on eating only what he considers \"comfortable, safe food.\"\n\"He absolutely loves spaghetti,\" Losier said. \"He would live on it. The only way I can get him to eat meat is ground beef in spaghetti sauce or sometimes a meatball or two. He also likes scrambled eggs, pizza, Mac 'n' cheese, french fries and most fruits. He loves watermelon.\"\nThis in itself makes life difficult for Losier as a mom trying to make sure her son enjoys a healthy and balanced diet. \"He does eat gummy daily vitamins, but I still worry about his long-term health,\" she said.\nAlso, Dax \"never feels full\" and will \"literally cry for more food that he likes no matter how much he's eaten,\" she said.\nBut what exacerbates the situation for Losier is the lack of understanding shown by many people.\nWhen she first uploaded the videos to TikTok detailing Dax's situation, some of the responses left her upset. \"I definitely feel like we need more awareness,\" Losier said. \"Some of my comment sections are so awful, telling me I should starve him or force him to eat, and it just is not that simple.\"\nBut Dax isn't alone in experiencing these struggles with food. Cherie Miller, an eating disorder psychotherapist, said he might have an eating disorder called avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), which is not an uncommon challenge for autistic kids.\n\"ARFID involves limitations in the amount and/or types of food a person will eat,\" Miller told Newsweek. \"There are three common subtypes of ARFID, and they have different reasons for the restriction: sensory sensitivities, fear of bad things happening—e.g., gagging, choking, vomiting—and a general lack of appetite and an apathy towards food.\"\nMiller said that while parents should seek the help of a therapist and dietitian specializing in eating disorders, as well as a pediatrician, parents can help address the problem.\n\"Treatment for these types of food issues in children does involve challenging kids to eat foods they are afraid to eat, but a gentle approach is best,\" she said. \"That means taking things slow to give kids time to learn coping skills to manage their anxiety and offering lots of support and encouragement.\"\nThat's another element of what made Dax's breakthrough with the chicken nugget so special. It came with the love and support of his mom, who offered quiet encouragement as he took those small but significant bites.\n\"I was nervous right before that he would throw up all over Chick-fil-A, but when he took that bite and chewed it up, I was incredibly proud of him,\" Losier said. \"He has had some other irrational fears that he has overcome recently—after much work—so I think that may have been boosting his confidence as well.\"\nLosier said she originally filmed the video to share it with her family. \"I was so excited after years of attempts by myself and my whole family to get him to try chicken that I wanted to video it.\"\nShe also wanted to thank the staff at the Westmoreland Mall branch of Chick-fil-A in Greensburg for providing the meal for free after learning about Dax's situation.\nLosier ended up posting the clip online, partly because she wanted to offer encouragement to other parents who may be in a similar position.\n\"I hope that it can give some hope to other parents struggling with the same issues,\" she said. \"Keep working with them. Keep offering. Be patient. You never know when they will wake up and decide that today they will say yes to tasting the chicken nugget.\"\n",

        "content": "Two polls have suggested Donald Trump will lose the presidential election, in the latest swing in what has been a tight race so far.\nIn March, the former leader and the incumbent President Joe Biden won enough primary races to secure, respectively, the Republican and Democratic nominations in the 2024 presidential election. Polls have so far shown that the results will be tight as the pair are statistically tied in most surveys or enjoying only marginal leads.\nHowever, two recent polls have suggested Trump is now lagging, marginally. In one poll of 1,046 adults by Florida Atlantic University and Mainstreet Research, 40 percent of all voters said they would vote for Biden and 38 percent would choose Trump in a race in which independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was included.\nWhen only likely voters were polled, 44 percent said they would vote for Biden and 39 percent for Trump.\nThe poll also found that in a two-person race where likely voters were polled, 47 percent would vote for Biden and 46 percent would vote for Trump.\nHowever in a two-person race when all voters were polled, Trump and Biden were tied with 44 percent of the vote each.\nThe poll was conducted between April 26 and April 28. The margin of error is +/- 3 percent.\nMeanwhile, a Reuters/Ipsos poll of 856 registered voters, which closed on Tuesday, found that 40 percent of registered voters would vote for Biden compared with 39 percent who would vote for Trump. However, the one percent lead is down from a four-point lead Biden had in a poll conducted by Reuters/Ipsos earlier in the month.\nThe survey has a 3 percentage point margin of error.\nNewsweek contacted Trump's campaign representative by email to comment on this story.\nMeanwhile, other recent polls have shown Trump is in the lead.\nA CNN poll of 1,212 people conducted by SSRS, an independent research company, between April 18 and 23 found that 49 percent of registered voters supported Trump, while 43 percent supported Biden, for instance.\nAn April poll by Bloomberg News and Morning Consult also indicated that Trump was polling ahead in six key swing states, by 6 points overall.\nAs these swing states may determine the result of the election, these polls are arguably more important than national polls.\nThomas Gift, who heads the Centre on U.S. Politics at University College London, previously told Newsweek that reading too much into polls was \"a fool's errand.\"\n\"Polls are so variable at this point that the only consistent insight we can glean from them is that Biden and Trump are neck and neck—not only nationally but in key swing states,\" he said. \"Trying to read too much into any one poll, or even set of polls, five months out from the election is a fool's errand.\"\nThe presidential election will take place on November 5.\n",

        "content": "In what began as a modest effort to support fraternity brothers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who intervened during a pro-Palestinian campus protest to protect an American flag that had been replaced by demonstrators, a tongue-in-cheek GoFundMe campaign has exploded into a major fundraising success.\nThe fundraiser, which started with the goal of throwing \"a world-class party\" for the \"boat-shoed Broletariat\" brothers of Pi Kappa Phi has significantly expanded its scope, garnering more than half-a-million dollars from over 12,000 donors. The response has been so staggering that organizers have decided to end the fundraiser as of Friday.\n\"We've been overwhelmed by the sheer force of patriotism on display,\" John Noonan, the organizer, said in a statement sent to Newsweek. \"What started as a simple gesture to reward a courageous act has captured the attention of millions, representing a wide spectrum of the American public.\"\nBy Friday morning, the GoFundMe had raised more than $516,000 from over 14,800 donors. Three donors — identified on the site as John Clark, Adam Sinn, and William Ackman, the outspoken billionaire investor — gave $10,000 each. A Republican congressman from Georgia, Mike Collins, donated $125. Susan Ralston, a former advisor to George W. Bush, also made a contribution and is listed an organizer.\nDespite the overwhelming public response, the fundraiser has stirred some controversy online, particularly concerning its management and transparency. The Pi Kappa Phi chapter at UNC clarified that they were unaware of Noonan's actions and had not authorized the campaign.\n\"We do not know John Noonan and we have been attempting to contact him,\" the fraternity wrote in an email to the local radio station WUNC on Thursday.\nA national Pi Kappa Phi spokeswoman told Newsweek that they did not set up the fundraiser and are not endorsing it.\nAccording to Noonan, who is a former aide to Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton, plans now include not only the promised \"rager\" but also charitable donations. An independent entity, featuring a board of directors along with representation from the fraternity, is being formed to ensure that the funds are used according to donor intent.\nBefore the campaign concluded, Noonan laid out the dual plans of the donations: \"There is nearly half a million in the bank. That is plenty to throw a killer party and give to some great charities.\"\nThe rapid influx of funds and support prompted the organizers to scale up their original plans. Volunteers have been drafted to manage the offers to contribute merchandise, entertainment, and more, Noonan said. A seasoned professional planner has also been retained to handle the complex logistics for the party.\n\"With graduation just around the corner, final exams in full swing, and continued drama on campus, we think it is best to take our time and plan this right,\" Noonan wrote on GoFundMe.\nThe viral incident that kicked off the fundraiser happened when pro-Palestinian demonstrators had replaced the U.S. flag on the campus' main quad with a Palestinian flag. Members of the UNC Chapel Hill chapter of the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity intervened to prevent the American flag from touching the ground, coming under both verbal and physical attacks as they held it up, according to video that circulated widely on social media.\nLike many other elite universities across the U.S., the bucolic Chapel Hill campus has been embroiled in protests between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli groups, who hold differing views on Israel's offensive in Gaza. More than 2,000 people across the country have been arrested since the protests began.\nThe protest movement originated at Columbia University, where students established an encampment demanding the university divest from companies linked to Israel over that country's ongoing war in Gaza, which followed a deadly attack by Hamas on southern Israel on October 7 in which militants killed 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage.\nIn retaliation, Israel's subsequent bombardment of Gaza has caused more than 34,000 deaths, according to the latest report by the Associated Press citing the local Hamas-run health ministry.\nUpdate 5/3/24 1:30 p.m. ET: This story has been corrected to note that Tom Cotton is a senator from Arkansas, not Texas.

Daniels is also said to have urged Davidson to settle the negotiations for the hush money quickly over fears she would lose leverage if Trump lost the election.\nEliason said on X that the attempts by Trump's legal team to suggest Daniels wanted the payment before the 2016 election to maintain leverage over Trump could also help the prosecution set out to the jury why the former president wanted to pay it.\n\"The defense bringing out that Daniels would lose all 'leverage' if the story wasn't purchased before the election is supposed to make it sound like extortion,\" Eliason wrote. \"But it actually helps the prosecution: the story had value to Trump only [because] of its ability to influence the election.\"\nExpanding on his remarks, Eliason told Newsweek: \"Everyone involved recognized that suppressing the story only had value to Trump prior to the election; after that he wouldn't care and wouldn't pay.\n\"The purpose of the hush money was not to avoid public embarrassment or keep the story from Melania—which could be done at any time—it was to influence the election. That is the prosecution's primary theory of the case, and the defense cross of Davidson helped reinforce it.\"\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in relation to $130,000 he arranged for Cohen to pay Daniels to keep an alleged affair she had with Trump secret in the run-up to the 2016 election, which was later listed in company records as Cohen's \"legal fees.\" Prosecutors suggested the payment was part of an unlawful attempt to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential race.\nNewsweek has contacted Donald Trump's legal team for comment via email.\nGeorge Grasso, a former judge at the New York City Criminal Court in Kings County, said Davidson \"produced some fireworks\" during his testimony, with Bove also conducting a \"fiery\" cross-examination.\n\"All told, while the witness had to endure some uncomfortable moments, his testimony appeared to hold together regarding his key role in facilitating the 'hush money' payments at the heart of the People's case,\" Grasso told Newsweek.\nTrump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, said he reimbursed the $130,000 payment to Cohen but denied having an affair with Daniels.\nIn April 2023, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office released a statement of facts about its investigation that said Trump instructed Cohen to delay paying Daniels the $130,000 sum for \"as long as possible\" in the hope that after the 2016 election they could \"avoid paying altogether, because at that point it would not matter if the story became public.\"\nElsewhere during Thursday's proceedings, Bove suggested Davidson approached breaking the law when he sought money from celebrities to stop potentially embarrassing stories about them from becoming public, including an alleged attempt to seek cash from wrestler Hulk Hogan in exchange for a sex tape.\n\"You were pretty well-versed in getting right up to the line without committing extortion, right?\" Bove asked.\nDavidson denied ever committing extortion, saying the settlements he reached with public figures were fair and legitimate.\nUpdate 5/3/24, 10:53 a.m. ET: This article has been updated with further comment from Randall Eliason.\n",

        "content": "Gen Z has been largely left out of Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness options this year, and many are struggling to pay off their monthly payments as they navigate low starting salaries and economic uncertainty.\nRead more: Student Loan Forgiveness Updates and FAQs\nGen Z—born from 1997-2012—graduated during an uncertain job market, with many entering the workforce right when the pandemic upended companies and shifted to a remote work culture. At the same time, the generation has faced some of the highest educational costs, with the average college tuition and fees at a four-year school costing $19,806 per year during the 2021-2022 school year.\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Gen Z has an average of $20,900 in student debt, which is 13 percent higher than millennials. That translates to a median loan of $12,800, which again is around 14 percent higher than that of millennials.\nDespite these factors, the Department of Education has not included Gen Z in most of the student loan relief options available to federal borrowers.\nBiden's current relief initiatives target those who took out loans more than 20 or 25 years ago or those who have worked in public service for 10 or more years.\nAltogether, Biden has canceled almost $160 billion for 4.6 million borrowers, but the majority of that relief comes after years of making loan payments, making Gen Z ineligible since they only recently graduated college or are still attending.\nMichael Lux, an attorney and the founder of the Student Loan Sherpa, said the majority of student debt relief has gone to older borrowers, but it was for a specific reason.\nRead more: Compare 12 of the Best Refinance Student Loans\n\"I'd also say that it is intentional. For many years, borrowers received lousy advice from loan servicers and the Biden fixes have attempted to fix these issues,\" Lux told Newsweek.\nOther times, loan relief went out to borrowers who attended misleading for-profit schools. Most recently, Biden passed $6.1 billion in student debt cancellation for the 317,000 borrowers who attended The Art Institutes.\nThis relief came as the organization \"falsified data, knowingly misled students, and cheated borrowers into taking on mountains of debt without leading to promising career prospects at the end of their studies,\" Biden said.\nThe institution closed its campuses last year after facing fraud accusations, and now everyone who attended The Art Institutes between January 1, 2004, and October 16, 2017, is eligible for forgiveness.\nNot all of Biden's attempts to cancel student debt have been fruitful, though. His administration initially passed $430 billion in student debt forgiveness, but the Supreme Court struck down the policy last year.\nUnder that policy, Biden would have seen more than 40 million Americans benefit, including many Gen Z-ers. The program hoped to offer $10,000 in relief to all borrowers earning less than $125,000. All borrowers who were Pell Grant recipients and came from a low-income background qualified for $20,000 in relief.\nStill, Gen Z is bound to benefit from Biden's loan forgiveness—it just might not be as immediate.\nThe new SAVE plan the Education Department has offered will see many Gen Z-ers get lower student loan bills monthly, if not full forgiveness down the line.\nUnder SAVE, borrowers will have their monthly payments calculated based on their income and family size, with many remaining balances forgiven after several years. Via the new repayment plan, monthly payments range from 5 to 10 percent of a borrower's discretionary income.\nBut none of the relief available negates the overarching problem that has led to the student loan forgiveness policies, Lux said.\nRead more: When Is the FAFSA Deadline?\n\"Ultimately, the root problem with student loans is that college is too expensive,\" Lux said. \"The forgiveness programs help people impacted by this issue, but it does nothing to lower the cost of college.\"\nAs Gen Z waits it out, many might feel tempted to forego their loan payments until another large-scale debt relief plan comes their way, but this would be a mistake, according to Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor at the University of Tennessee at Martin.\n\"It looks like Gen Z student loan holders will mostly have to wait to take advantage of forgiveness programs until 10 years or more after the start of their payments, but they should wait with caution and still make their monthly payments,\" Beene told Newsweek. \"There's no guarantee there will be forgiveness plans down the line, and avoiding your student loan payments will have long-term financial repercussions on their credit score.\"\n",

Like Wordle, a word-based game that took the English-speaking world by storm during the height of the coronavirus pandemic, Connections quickly gained both success and a dedicated fan base trying each day to crack the categories.\nThe idea of the game is to sort a total of 16 words into four categories, each made up of four words. The words in each category all share something in common, and it's your goal to figure out what exactly that is.\nThe categories differ in difficulty—those in the blue category tend to be the easiest to guess. After that, there are the yellow and green categories, and those words lighting up purple are often the hardest to guess. Some words may have several meanings and could fall into a number of categories, so watch out for those!\nOnce you make your selections, you can press \"submit,\" and see if you're right.

Free Palestine!\" while the other read: \"We stand with Israel. Jewish lives matter,\" the Associated Press reported.\nUniversity of Michigan spokesperson Colleen Mastony told Newsweek in an email on Saturday evening that no one was arrested and said the protest did not delay the nearly two-hour ceremony, which \"celebrated the achievements of 8,500 undergraduates and 6,622 graduate and PhD students before a crowd of 62,000 wellwishers.\"\n\"The mood was joyous and the ceremony unfolded successfully and was completed without interruption,\" Mastony said. \"Approximately 75 protesters staged a small demonstration at the beginning of the program, walking up the main aisle and chanting before public safety personnel escorted them to the rear of the stadium, where they remained through the conclusion of the event.\"\nMastony continued: \"Peaceful protests like this have taken place at U-M commencement ceremonies for decades. The university supports free speech and expression, and university leaders are pleased that today's commencement was such a proud and triumphant moment, worthy of the achievements of our extraordinary graduates.\"\nVideos shared to X, formerly Twitter, show the demonstration and the moment the crowd erupts into cheers as the group is escorted away.

You are funding genocide.\" Israel has rejected the allegation that its actions in Gaza are genocidal.\nAnother video appears to show people chanting in response to the protesters, yelling \"Shut the f*** up.\"\nX user Aviva Klompas captioned the clip: \"The pro-terror mob is currently ruining graduation day at@UMich.\"\nAuthor Oil London shared a video of the demonstration and wrote: \"University of Michigan commencement ceremony RUINED after mob of anti-Israel activists stormed the ceremony waving Palestinian flags.

'Disclose, divest, we will not stop, we will not rest.'\"\nU.S. Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro, a commencement speaker, paused several times during his remarks, before saying, \"Ladies and gentlemen, if you can please draw your attention back to the podium,\" the AP reported.\nMeanwhile, pro-Palestinian demonstrations have spread across campuses in the U.S. following the arrests of protesters who set up a \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment\" at Columbia University in New York City on April 18. Since then, encampment demonstrations began popping up at universities all over the country, and hundreds of protesters have been arrested. Participants have been demanding that universities divest from companies supporting Israel as well as a permanent ceasefire to end the Israel-Hamas war.\nIsrael responded militarily after Hamas, a Palestinian militant group, launched a surprise attack on October 7, 2023, on the country that killed roughly 1,200 people and saw over 200 more taken hostage into Gaza. In nearly seven months of fighting, the Palestinian death toll has surpassed 34,000, with more than 76,000 injured in the besieged territory, according to the AP, per the Gaza Health Ministry, which notes that at least two-thirds have been children and women.\nThe staggering number of Palestinian deaths has sparked widespread condemnation from across the globe. Meanwhile, some protests have turned disruptive and violent, prompting police intervention and causing top U.S. lawmakers to pass legislation. Last week, the House of Representatives approved the Antisemitism Awareness Act to address reports of rising antisemitism on college campuses amid allegations of Jewish students being targeted during campus protests.\n",

        "content": "Legal analyst Steve Vladeck wrote Saturday in an opinion piece for MSNBC that a recent move by former President Donald Trump's lawyers in his Mar-a-Lago classified documents case is \"doomed to fail.\"\nIn a new motion filed on Thursday to U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who is overseeing the case and was appointed by the former president in 2020, Trump's lawyers argue that a Chinese immigrant's 1886 Supreme Court triumph provides \"selective prosecution\" precedent for throwing out Trump's charges in the classified documents case.\nTrump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has pleaded not guilty to Department of Justice (DOJ) special counsel Jack Smith's 40 charges where it's alleged that he retained classified materials after he left the White House in January 2021 and then obstructed the federal attempt to retrieve them from his Mar-a-Lago resort residence in Palm Beach, Florida.\nTrump's team cites the Court case, Yick Wo v. Hopkins, involving \"Lee Yick,\" who was convicted for operating an unlicensed laundry in San Francisco. The immigrant sued and eventually won a landmark Supreme Court case that stated that Yick's Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution's 14th Amendment was being violated.\nIn the case's decision, Justice Stanley Matthews wrote that even if a law's wording appears fair, the Constitution bars the law if it is administered \"with an evil eye and unequal hand, so as practically to make unjust and illegal discrimination.\"\nHowever, Vladeck contends in his opinion piece that Trump's lawyers will struggle to convince Cannon that their client is comparable to Yick and his Supreme Court argument.\n\"Like claims about the unfairness of pretrial detention or the severity of the sentences in the Jan. 6 cases, there is a familiar — and perverse — irony at the bottom of Trump's selective prosecution argument,\" Vladeck, a University of Texas School of Law professor, wrote. \"Maybe we ought to discuss limiting the circumstances, in general, in which pretrial defendants can be detained. Maybe we ought to discuss reforms to all federal criminal sentences. Maybe we ought to discuss making it easier for defendants to establish selective prosecution claims. But as the selective prosecution claim in the Mar-a-Lago case makes clear, Trump isn't the poster child for these reforms; he's the anti-poster-child. Indeed, he's in the position he's in entirely because his behavior went so far beyond the limits of that of any of his predecessors.\"\nHe added: \"That wasn't true of Lee Yick, and that why Trump's arguments that he's just like Lee Yick are doomed to fail.\"\nNewsweek reached out to Trump lawyer Todd Blanche Saturday afternoon through his website. This story will be updated with any provided statements.\nThe trial date in the classified documents case has yet to be finalized, but Cannon is expected to postpone it beyond its scheduled start date of May 20.\nVladeck also provided two \"fatal problems\" to Trump's new motion, which was filed by Blanche and Chris Kise.\n\"First, for better or worse, the Supreme Court has made selective prosecution claims notoriously difficult to prove. Second, Trump is just about the worst possible person to bring a selective prosecution claim — since so much of his allegedly unlawful conduct in the Mar-a-Lago case is unprecedented,\" Vladeck wrote in his opinion piece. \"Only if the defendant could prove that the government had deliberately and intentionally singled him out from other similarly situated suspects without any good reason would such a claim succeed.\"\nIn the motion to Cannon, Trump attorneys list current and former government officials, including President Joe Biden, Trump's former Vice President Mike Pence and Trump's former 2016 opponent in the presidential race, Hillary Clinton. They claim that Trump's rivals have acted similarly to the former president in the Mar-a-Lago documents case, but \"no one in the government lifted a finger\" to their actions.\nRobert Hur, the DOJ's special counsel who investigated classified documents found at Biden's home and former offices, said in February that the president cooperated with his probe, which were among several \"material distinctions\" compared to Trump's documents case. Hur didn't bring charges against Biden, but found evidence that Biden willfully held onto sensitive material after he left the vice presidency in 2017.\nTrump's lawyers outline that Pence was found to be holding onto classified documents at his home in Indiana yet was not indicted. The motion says that Pence made a number of disclosures to the National Archives and Records Administration [NARA] after leaving the White House.\nThey also pointed to Clinton's use of a private email server for official messages when she was secretary of state under former President Barack Obama. The FBI did investigate Clinton and chose not to indict.\n\"For try as his brief might, it doesn't identify any other cases with similar claims about affirmative misrepresentations concerning the suspect's retention of classified information. Because there aren't any,\" Vladeck wrote. \"Indeed, the reason Trump's selective prosecution claim should fail is because of how much worse the conduct alleged in the Mar-a-Lago case is than that of the other officials his brief invokes as the relevant exemplars.\"\nHe added: \"In the court of public opinion, where facts don't matter all that much, Trump and his supporters can wave their hands and make the cases look similar. But in a court of law, that's not enough — and shouldn't be enough.\"\n",

        "content": "Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, rebuked Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson, calling it an \"utterly ridiculous\" plan on Saturday.\nGreene, a Georgia Republican, announced on Wednesday that she plans to call a vote on her previously unprivileged motion to vacate Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, sparking criticism from several members of the GOP who warned the move may be damaging to the party.\nGreene introduced the motion to vacate Johnson in March after he passed the $1.2 trillion spending package with Democratic support to fund the government. Greene, a staunch supporter of former President Donald Trump, has continued to scrutinize Johnson over his support for the bipartisan spending bill that includes $60.8 billion of aid to Ukraine in its ongoing war with Russia. Meanwhile, Johnson has continued to face mounting criticism from House conservatives as he pushed forward the bill, which passed House legislation late last month.\nSince Greene's announcement, several Republicans have criticized the congresswoman.\nCruz rebuked Greene's plans on Saturday as he told The Hill, \"I think it is utterly ridiculous and counterproductive.\"\nSenator Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, also criticized Greene on CNN late last month, describing her as \"uninformed\" and a \"total waste of time.\"\n\"She is a horrible leader. She is dragging our brand down. She, not the Democrats, are the biggest risk to us getting back to a majority,\" he said.\nHowever, Greene has previously fired back at her critics as she said that she doesn't \"give a rat's a**\" what her colleagues think about her hopes to remove Johnson.\n\"I voted for Mike Johnson because his voting record before he became speaker was conservative. But once he became speaker, he has become a man that none of us recognize,\" the congresswoman said Wednesday at a news conference announcing her plans to hold a vote.\nNewsweek has reached out to Cruz and Greene's office via email for additional comment.\nSo far, only two other Republicans have come out in support of Greene, Representatives Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona.\nMeanwhile, the House Democratic leadership has also said it is against the vote.\nIf a vote is held on the motion to vacate, Johnson may need to turn to Democrats to save his speakership due to the GOP's slim 4-seat majority. Due to other vacancies, this would leave Johnson with room for only one Republican detractor, barring any Democratic support.\nIn addition, Representatives Anna Paulina Luna and Matt Gaetz, both Florida Republicans, have warned that Greene's efforts could also lead to the possibility that a Democrat could become speaker.\nDuring an interview on Rumble with Gaetz last month, Luna reiterated her criticisms of Johnson, but warned against the possibility that a Democrat could become speaker.\n\"The Uniparty has prioritized foreign interests again and placed America last. Speaker Johnson has gone back on most of what he said when we elected him to be Speaker, rendering him almost unrecognizable as a legislator and the leader we chose. That being said, the possibility of a Democratic-controlled House poses a greater risk. We stand as the last barrier that has stopped Biden from completely ruining our country. Given our historically narrow majority, we must not allow the gavel to pass to the Democrats,\" Luna previously told Newsweek.\nMeanwhile, in response to the recent calls for Johnson to vacate, the House speaker warned about what a motion to vacate would mean for Congress during a press conference last month.\n\"I don't think that would be helpful to us from a political standpoint for the Republican Party to continue to govern, maintain and keep our majority in November. I think that would have been a great hindrance to it. And so, that wouldn't be helpful. Nor does a motion to vacate help us in that regard, either. It would be chaos in the House,\" he said.\n",

The structure for Kyiv symbolizes Russian occupation but is also a key link to transport Moscow's troops and equipment to the frontline and a strike on it could impact its war effort.\nAs well as the bridge, Ukraine has also stepped up its attacks on Russian naval assets in the wider region with repeated strikes on vessels and infrastructure belonging to the Black Sea Fleet, much of which Moscow has relocated to Novorossiysk, in Russia's Krasnodar region.\nZakharova said preparations \"are being carried out openly, with ostentatious bravado and with the absolute and direct support of the collective West.\"\nShe referred to the reported delivery of U.S.-supplied ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems) long range missiles last month, citing the Russian defense ministry's claim that six of the missiles had been shot down over the peninsula last week.\nU.S. officials said last month that Kyiv had started using ATACMS missiles for the first time on a Russian military airfield in Crimea, hitting Russian forces in another occupied area.\nWashington had first delivered mid-range older models of ATACMS missiles last year with a shorter range of around 100 miles but the newer missiles have a range of up to 190 miles, potentially putting hundreds of Russian military facilities in Crimea within range.\nIn her briefing, Zakharova also noted reports that Kyiv was set to receive its first delivery of F-16 aircraft, \"which, according to the British, can also be used in the operation to destroy the Crimean Bridge.\"\n\"We would like to once again warn Washington, London and Brussels that any aggressive actions against Crimea are not only doomed to failure, but will also receive an indestructible blow of retaliation,\" she said, without specifying further.\nNewsweek has contacted the U.S. State Department for comment.\nFollowing her comments, the Russian defense ministry said on Saturday its air defense forces shot down four ATACMS missiles over the Crimean Peninsula, claiming that they had successfully downed 15 of the missiles in recent weeks.\nRussia often claims to have downed Ukrainian missiles and drones without reporting damage, although later reports can show how military targets or infrastructure have actually been struck.\n",

This was seized upon by Volodin who used disparaging language about mental illness to take aim at Zelensky and Biden.\n\"According to these criteria, the first who should be drafted into the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are Biden as a mentally challenged person, as well as his friend Zelensky as a mental patient dependent on various drugs,\" Volodin wrote.\nNewsweek has contacted the White House and Zelensky's office for comment.\nFaced by dwindling troop numbers and calls from relatives of troops on the frontline for soldiers to be rotated, Ukraine faces a critical shortage of personnel as Russia gears up for an expected offensive in the coming weeks.\nWhile many had volunteered for Ukraine's war effort at the start of Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion, high losses as the war dragged on has led to around 650,000 military-aged Ukrainians fleeing the country, through bribes, illegal crossings or fake medical records, according to the BBC.\nLast August, Zelensky fired conscription officers who accepted bribes from those trying to avoid mobilization. The Ukrainian foreign ministry announced on April 24 it would suspend consular services to Ukrainian men overseas aged between 18 and 60 except for those returning. Kyiv has also banned the delivery of identification documents to Ukrainian men of military age abroad.\n",

Russia also attacked Ukraine with four surface-to-air guided missiles while drones attacked the eastern city of Kharkiv, damaging civilian infrastructure, Kyiv said.\nGerman company HENSOLDT will send six more TRML-4D radars to Ukraine to strengthen the country's air defense by the end of the year which the firm told Newsweek was part of a package of aid from Berlin worth over 100 million euros ($107 million).\nThe firm, which also supplies the German Armed Forces, said that the radars can detect and track drones, low-flying cruise missiles and aircraft, including helicopters, within a radius of up to 160 miles. \"Our radars are urgently needed by the Ukrainian air defense,\" said HENSOLDT CEO Oliver Dörre in a statement.\nIt comes as the German government has also said that it will send another Patriot air defense system to Ukraine as soon as possible. Newsweek has contacted the Ukrainian defense ministry for comment.\nAccording to German government figures, Berlin has sent eight TRML-4D radars to Ukraine so far, with another one being announced on April 29 as part of further military assistance.\nDespite the additional German assistance for Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has faced criticism for saying Berlin cannot supply the Taurus KEPD-350 missile, which Kyiv has long called for. Scholz has said its supply would draw Germany into the conflict and would require tactical assistance from Berlin that contravenes NATO members' efforts to contain the war in Ukraine.\nHowever, Berlin has remained a key ally for Ukraine against Russian aggression, having delivered or earmarked €28 billion ($30 billion) worth of military assistance to Ukraine, according to the latest German government figures.\nThe tranche announced this week includes at least 10 Marder combat vehicles, an air surveillance radar, as well as rounds of ammunition for Leopard 2 battle tanks.\nIt comes as Russian forces continue to build on momentum in the eastern front, following the capture of Avdiivka in the Donetsk oblast. Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) Deputy Chief Major General Vadym Skibitsky told The Economist that Russia is likely to launch an offensive at the end of May or the beginning of June.\nHe said Moscow is looking to take advantage of Ukraine's ongoing materiel and manpower shortages before an American military aid package just passed by U.S. Congress is set to arrive.\n",

        "content": "In the vast deserts of North Africa, a new city featuring the tallest tower on the continent and the largest cathedral in the Middle East is taking shape.\nThirty miles east of Cairo, Egypt, the temporarily named New Administrative Capital (NAC), initiated by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, aims to accommodate a significant portion of Egypt's growing population, now exceeding 105 million.\nExclusive imagery provided to Newsweek by Maxar Technologies shows the state of construction on the new government district, a project designed to transfer Cairo's administrative and economic heartbeat to a more modern and sustainable environment.\nAmong the city's cultural and architectural highlights are a 70-story tower — already the tallest in Africa — alongside religious sites including the Middle East's largest cathedral and a grand mosque.\nThe development plan also includes the Green River Park, envisioned as a vast urban oasis double the size of New York's Central Park, and The Octagon, intended to be the new, expansive headquarters for Egypt's Ministry of Defense. The Capital International Airport is designed to ease congestion at Cairo's airports and serve as a new regional hub.\nThe Egypt International Olympic City, still in the planning stages, aims to host major international sports events with facilities like the New Administrative Capital Stadium, which will be the largest stadium in Egypt.\nThe NAC has yet to be given a formal name. A competition was launched on the new capital's website to choose a new name and logo for the city. No official results have yet been announced.\nSome government functions have already started the transition from Cairo to the NAC. Khaled Abbas, chairman of the Administrative Capital for Urban Development (ACUD), told CNN last month there are already 48,000 government employees working in the NAC, mostly commuting from greater Cairo via a new electric rail line. Officials hope to eventually centralize Cairo's government and business districts in the area, which will be run by a system of A.I.-powered technologies to optimize utilities, trash collection and the flow of traffic.\nThe NAC is gradually coming to life, with more than 1,500 families already relocated, according to Abbas. By the end of this year, he expects the number to rise to 10,000. The city is projected to house five million residents, taking some of the pressure off Cairo, the congested and polluted capital home to 22 million people.\nStill, there are concerns the NAC will not live up to its promise of being a livable option for vast swaths of Egyptians, with some Cairo residents telling Reuters they \"cannot afford to live in the new city.\" Egypt is notorious for developing new cities in its deserts, promising to alleviate the overcrowded capital. New Cairo, a satellite city established in 2000 was built to house as many as five million people. As of 2017, fewer than 300,000 people lived within its confines.\nEstimated to cost up to $60 billion over four phases of development — with much of the cost shouldered by the Egyptian military — some critics have questioned whether the NAC is an appropriate use of funds. Egypt is facing one of its worst financial crises in decades, and the economy is largely being held up by international loans.\nBut with phase one all but complete and construction on phase two scheduled to begin this year, the NAC is already further along than many of the world's other megaprojects. In Indonesia, where a similar development is in the process of creating an entirely new capital to replace the congested and sinking city of Jakarta, not a single building has yet to be competed despite a grand ribbon-cutting set for this summer.\nDo you have a story we should be covering?

Ukraine also said it had taken out 31 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) putting the total number of destroyed drones at 9,611, only 389 short of the 10,000 mark.\nMeanwhile, Moscow's forces also lost another 27 armored fighting vehicles on Friday for a total of 14,156—less than 900 away from the 15,000 mark.\nBut Russian troop losses continue to mount up, with Kyiv's estimate of 1,260 casualties for Friday being the seventh consecutive day this figure had topped 1,000. That includes both those who are killed and injured and Kyiv says its estimate of both personnel and equipment losses are \"very approximate, and do not claim to be particularly accurate.\"\nNewsweek has contacted the Russian defense ministry for comment.\nGetting an accurate figure of Russian troop losses is difficult but French Foreign Minister Stéphane Séjourne said in an interview released on Friday that Paris estimates Russian casualties were 500,000, 150,000 of whom had been killed.\n\"What is all this for?\" he told independent Russian outlet, Novaya Gazeta Europa. \"In short, there is no need.\"\nRussia has not updated its tally of losses since September 2022 when Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said was just under 6,000.\nKyiv is often tight-lipped about its losses, although in a rare admission, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in February that 31,000 of his troops had been killed.\nHowever, Shoigu said on Friday that Ukraine's troop losses had surpassed 111,000, as he claimed that Russian forces \"continue breaking the enemy's system of strongholds along the entire line of contact.\"\nRussia's Defense Ministry said it has recently captured settlements around the town of Avdiivka, in the Donetsk oblast, which was seized in February.\nShoigu announced the capture of 211 square miles of territory so far this year. This was higher than the figure of 155 square miles he had announced in April.\nThe Institute for the Study of War estimates Russia controls around one fifth of Ukrainian territory, or more than 38,000 square miles.\nThe think tank has predicted that Russia will conduct a major offensive in the coming weeks as it seeks to capitalize on Ukraine's lack of ammunition as it eagerly awaits the delivery of U.S. military aid following a $61 billion package passed by U.S. Congress\n",

When shareholders of Digital World Acquisition Corp., an existing shell company, agreed to merge with TMTG earlier this year—clearing the way for the former president's company to go public—its stock value declined after an initial boost.\nWhen the merged group debuted on the stock market on March 26, under the ticker DJT, shares initially surged above $78, closing its first day of trading at $57.99 and giving the company a valuation of $11 billion. The value of each share in the merged group reached $71.90 on March 27, before its profit and loss figures were released.\nThen, the company's share value declined. On April 17, Google Finance data showed the value of each share at $22.84. That was the lowest the share price had been since January 16, exactly three months earlier, when it was $22.35, meaning the share price was a little more than before it merged with Trump's Truth Social.\nOn April 15, Trump filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) meaning that, pending the SEC's approval, some investors will be able to sell their shares, with one analyst suggesting people sell their stakes in the company.\nIn an apparent effort to avoid this, on April 29, TMTG issued a press release highlighting steps shareholders could take to prevent brokerage firms lending their shares for the purpose of short selling. The release also included a sample email shareholders could send to brokers to opt-out of securities lending programs.\nCompany CEO Devin Nunes, a former Republican congressman from California, also sent a letter to stock market index Nasdaq's chief, Adena Friedman, raising concerns about short selling.\n\"DJT appears on Nasdaq's 'Reg SHO threshold list,' which is indicative of unlawful trading activity,\" the letter, published in an SEC filing on Friday, said. \"This is particularly troubling given that 'naked' short selling often entails sophisticated market participants profiting at the expense of retail investors.\"\nNaked shorting is a form of investing in which shares being bet against are never secured or borrowed. It is banned because it can artificially distort market supply and incite volatility.\nSince then, the value of the shares increased somewhat and, according to April 29 Google Finance data, was up to $41.54 a share.\nOn May 3, the latest available Google Finance data shows it is $48.68 a share. It has been a week since the stock was worth less than $45, showing the company's approach appears to be working.\nHowever, Todd Landman, a professor of political science at the School of Politics and International Relations at the University of Nottingham in the U.K., said the stock was still \"volatile.\"\n\"The stock value remains relatively volatile with its surge to USD $66.22 at the end of March, after which it dropped to USD $22.84, but has seen a steady climb since 16 April back up to USD $48.68 by 2 May,\" he said. \"It has thus not recovered to the value in late March and there remains the key question as to whether Mr. Trump will sell his shares in September, which could affect the share price.\"\nA TMTG spokesperson told Newsweek: \"We will take whatever actions are necessary to prevent our retail investors from being exploited.\"\n",

        "content": "Boeing's stock has gone up this week after a whistleblower died suddenly, the second to pass away in the past few months.\nThe family of Josh Dean, a former quality auditor at Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems, said that he had died on Tuesday after contracting a sudden illness.\nThe aviation company's stock rose this week, according to MarketWatch.\nThere is nothing to suggest that Dean's death was suspicious, or that it has influenced Boeing's stock surge—the company's stock had already been on an upward trajectory over the past week.\nRead more: The Best Stocks to Invest In Now\nDean became a whistleblower after accusing his former employer of ignoring defects in the production of the 737 MAX planes, which have faced scrutiny following a series of safety issues.\nDean was the second Boeing whistleblower to die suddenly this year. Former Boeing employee John Barnett was found dead less than two months ago of a gunshot wound that officials said appeared to be self-inflicted.\nThe financial publication Barron's noted on Thursday that Boeing's stock went up this week after the company sold $10 billion in debt, a move the publication says cleared up uncertainty for investors about how much the company would have to pay to borrow money.\nRead more: Compare the Top Investment Apps\nBoeing has faced pressure following a series of headline-grabbing safety incidents with its aircraft this year, including one in which part of the fuselage of an Alaska Airlines flight blew out mid-air.\nThe company's CEO, Dave Calhoun, announced last month that he plans to step down at the end of the year.\nDespite the difficulties, the company last week reported a better than expected loss in the first quarter of 2024.\nThe company has reduced the production of its popular 737 MAX planes amid the safety crisis.\nCalhoun said that Boeing was asserting control over its manufacturing discipline and had plans to acquire Spirit AeroSystems, its fuselage supplier, later this year.\n\"Near term, yes, we are in a tough moment,\" Calhoun said in a note to employees Wednesday, per CNBC.\n\"Lower deliveries can be difficult for our customers and for our financials. But safety and quality must and will come above all else. We are absolutely committed to doing everything we can to make certain our regulators, customers, employees, and the flying public are 100 percent confident in Boeing.\"\n",

The IRS warns that criminals often go after a business's most valuable data: credit card and payment information, business and employee identities, and tax and financial information.\nRead more: Best Tax Software for Small Businesses\nIf a business suffers a cybersecurity incident, it can have serious ramifications, and not just reputationally. Stolen information can be used for a variety of crimes, including identity theft, fraudulent tax returns, and identity theft. And once it's too late, these can be timely and costly issues to resolve.\nOne of the more recent scams impacting U.S. businesses is the \"new client\" spearphishing scam. In such a case, a cybercriminal will pretend to be a prospective client, requesting they respond to their emails. When the owner complies, the criminal then sends a malicious attachment or website address that can \"compromise the victim's computer systems and allows the attacker to access sensitive customer and financial information.\"\nThe IRS advises two key areas that businesses should review their protections of business files and devices, and wireless networks.\nRead more: How to Find a Small Business Accountant\n\"Each year, the IRS sees thousands of attempts trying to attack small business owners and other taxpayers.

But one side effect of the rates is that Americans' bank account money is soaring in savings interest.\nRead more: Compare the Best High-Yield Savings Accounts to Grow Your Savings\nSavers last year made $315.4 billion in interest in their deposit accounts, which was a whopping four times the $78.7 billion Americans made in 2022, LendingTree found.\n\"It's the best time to be a saver in over 20 years,\" Alex Beene, financial literacy instructor at the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek. \"If you haven't been taking advantage of these higher interest rates for certain accounts, do so immediately. Every month you fail to do so could amount to many extra dollars not coming into your account.\"\nThe savings gains happened as the average interest rate on regular bank savings accounts is 0.5 percent. In some cases, at larger banks, it's as low as 0.01 percent.\nBut savers using high-yield savings accounts saw interest rates above 4 percent, with some reaching 5 percent to 5.5 percent.

And, echoing McBride's sentiment, it's unclear how long this could last, due to what the Fed has consistently called \"sticky\" inflation.\nIn March, inflation had reached 3.5 percent compared to a year ago, which remains far above the 2 percent rate the Fed continues to want for the economy.\n\"The Fed will keep rates higher for longer and the expectation is that we \"may\" see one rate cut this year, if any,\" Thompson told Newsweek. \"So, do not expect rates to come down in the near term.\"\n",

He is regarded as one of the greatest military commanders in history, helping to expand Egypt's empire to its greatest extent thanks to a succession of victorious campaigns.\nIt is likely that the ancient building in Sinai was used as a royal rest house thanks to the architectural layout and the scarcity of pottery shards found inside, according to the MTA. The pharaoh himself may have used the facility during his military campaigns to expand the Egyptian empire to the east, researchers believe.\nThe building consists of two consecutive rectangular halls, accompanied by a number of rooms. It appears to have been fortified with a perimeter wall.\n\"This discovery is pivotal as it illuminates crucial aspects of Egypt's military history, particularly in the Sinai region, during the New Kingdom era,\" said Mohamed Ismail Khaled, Secretary-General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, as reported by Ahram Online.\nArchaeological work at the site also uncovered a number of burials, indicating that it was used as a cemetery during later periods in ancient Egyptian history.\nThe latest discovery is just one of many ancient finds reported from Egypt in recent months.\nFor example, archaeologists announced earlier this year that they had uncovered the missing upper part of a \"huge\" statue depicting an ancient Egyptian pharaoh.\nA joint Egyptian-American archaeological mission discovered the statue part during excavations conducted at the southern border of the Khemenu/Hermopolis Magna archaeological site, Yvona Trnka-Amrhein, one of the leaders of the project, previously told Newsweek.\nThe ancient city of Khemenu was a provincial capital since Egypt's Old Kingdom and developed into a major settlement during the Roman period.\nIn January, another team unearthed several ancient tombs with dozens of mummies—including some with golden tongues—at the ancient city of Oxyrhynchus, an extensive archaeological site located around 100 miles south-southwest of Cairo near the modern-day municipality of Al-Bahnasa in Minya Governorate.\nOxyrhynchus was \"very important\" during ancient Egypt's Greco-Roman period, which spanned hundreds of years from the late fourth century B.C. until the 7th century, Esther Pons Mellado and Maite Mascort, co-directors of a Spanish archaeological mission at the site, previously told Newsweek.\n\"[It] was the second city of Egypt after Alexandria. There was a great business and cultural relationship between these two cities,\" they said.\nDo you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?

        "content": "The U.S. is in the midst of a multistate outbreak of bird flu, with 1 in 5 commercial milk samples testing positive for genetic traces of the virus. But does the virus pose any threat to humans?\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza is an infectious viral illness that spreads primarily among wild and domestic birds. But the virus that causes bird flu can sometimes jump into animals, including dairy cows and, in some cases, humans.\n\"Bird flu, or avian influenza, infects more than 100 species of wild birds, especially migratory waterfowl,\" Carl Abraham, an assistant professor of medicine at the New York Institute of Technology, told Newsweek. \"In birds, it is highly contagious [and] causes a respiratory illness that is categorized as either highly pathogenic or low pathogenic.\n\"Pathogenicity relates to how sick the infected animal is, and highly pathogenic avian influenza [which is the form of the disease causing the current outbreak] has the ability to spread beyond the airways and lungs to infect multiple organs often resulting in death in birds within 48 hours.\"\nOver the last decade, bird flu cases in mammals have been on the rise.\n\"In most cases, mammal infection is thought to occur after the animal eats an infected bird,\" Abraham said.\n\"In 2024, the first reports of avian influenza (H5N1 strain) infected U.S. domesticated cattle that is possibly being transmitted cow-to-cow. This is now a multistate outbreak although the numbers of cattle infected in each state is small and the illness marked by transient reductions in milk production.\"\nDespite the relatively small number of infected cows, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has identified genetic traces of the virus in 1 in 5 commercial milk samples tested. The virus fragments are not actually capable of causing an infection—the process of pasteurization has seen to that—but the findings raise concerns about the risks associated with unpasteurized \"raw milks.\"\nIn a recent report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, researchers warned that such unpasteurized milk posed a significant for potential cross-species infections. In particular, the study focused on the risks to domestic cats, who have developed fatal infections after drinking unpasteurized milk from affected cows.\n\"Our findings support those of previous work that has shown domestic cats can be highly susceptible to HPAI A (H5N1) virus,\" the study's first author, Eric Burrough, a professor of veterinary medicine at Iowa State University, told Newsweek. \"Cats that have outdoor access should be monitored to avoid potential exposure to and consumption of dead wild birds.\"\n\"It is rare for avian influenza to infect humans,\" Abraham said. \"Two cases have been reported in the U.S., both in persons with significant exposure to infected mammals—most recently this year in a cattle worker in Texas who had conjunctivitis [pink eye] as the only symptom. Therefore, the risk of illness to humans is extremely low.\n\"Persons who own birds that come into contact with wild birds and cattle farmers are at most risk to come into contact with bird flu, but the risk of illness in those persons is still negligible.\"\nHowever, as we saw in 2020, viruses can evolve fast.\nRead more: Compare Top Health Savings Accounts\n\"Influenza has a complicated replication cycle within multiple species,\" Abraham said. \"This frequently causes the genes of different strains within a single host to mix, commonly referred to as recombination events.\n\"Most recombination events result in influenza viruses that are not able to replicate or replicate less efficiently. However, rare recombination events may increase illness severity, increase transmission, or even, as we are seeing with cattle this year, infection of new species. It is possible for a recombination event to give avian influenza the ability to infect humans.\n\"If the same virus caused human-to-human transmission, it could have pandemic potential. Again, this would be a rare event, but it is possible.\"\nWhile no significant threat has been identified for humans, Abraham added that studying viral transmission patterns like this could help predict and prevent future pandemics.\n\"The new information gained as we study viral outbreaks helps us to prepare for the next pandemic [not an \"if,\" but a \"when\" scenario],\" he said. \"Responses to outbreaks based on scientific evidence are most likely to result in the best public health outcome. What we learn today may save us tomorrow. That which we ignore puts as at risk. Stay safe.\"\nIs there a health problem that's worrying you? Let us know via health@newsweek.com.

        "content": "An incredibly rare Roman-era object—made from a substance that was once worth more than its weight in gold—has been discovered at an archaeological site in the United Kingdom.\nThe item was unearthed during excavations conducted in 2023 by archaeologists and volunteers at the site of a Roman bathhouse located within the grounds of a sports club in the city of Carlisle, northern England.\nTesting of the lump—made from a soft, mysterious, purple substance—subsequently revealed that it contained beeswax and an element known as bromine. This is a strong indication that it represents a solid sample of Tyrian purple—a man-made pigment that was highly valued in the ancient world.\nThe dye, which is purple in color, is secreted by several species of predatory sea snails that are found in the Mediterranean region. Producing Tyrian purple was an extremely difficult task. The process was complex and required the collection of thousands of marine snails. In fact, it is estimated that it up to 12,000 individual mollusks would need to be processed to produce just 1 gram of dye.\nAs a result, it was extremely expensive during Roman times, to the extent that it was worth more than gold, pound-for-pound. The pigment was generally reserved for use by the upper echelons of society.\n\"For millennia, Tyrian purple was the world's most expensive and sought after color,\" Frank Giecco, an archaeologist with mining consultancy company Wardell Armstrong, which has been involved in excavations at the Carlisle site, said in a press release.\nFinding a solid sample, such as the one from Carlisle, is a particular unusual find, according to Giecco.\n\"It's the only example we know of in Northern Europe—possibly the only example of a solid sample of the pigment in the form of unused paint pigment anywhere in the Roman Empire,\" Giecco said in the release. \"Examples have been found of it in wall paintings (like in Pompeii) and also some high status painted coffins from the Roman province of Egypt.\"\nTyrian purple is thought to have first been manufactured in the 2nd millennium B.C. by the Phoenicians—an ancient civilization of the Mediterranean region that originated in the coastal Levant region, primarily in an area that is now occupied by modern Lebanon.\nThe purple pigment was most famously produced in Tyre—a city located in Lebanon that is one of the oldest continuously inhabited settlements in the world. However, it was also manufactured in other regions of the Mediterranean, such as North Africa.\nThe Tyrian purple sample from Carlisle was likely used for painting frescos, Sarah Irving, a spokesperson for Cumberland Council, which has partnered with Wardell Armstrong on the excavation project, told Newsweek.\nSometimes the pigment was used to paint walls in grand public buildings, as well as the homes and properties of the elite. However, it was also used to dye clothes.\nExcavations at the site of the Roman bathhouse have unearthed more than 2,800 significant finds to date, including hundreds of coins, carved gemstones and two monumental stone heads.\n\"Following the discovery of the two Roman monumental heads and the other precious items, the project is unearthing some fascinating and globally significant finds. More digs are planned, as well as the opportunity to visit the site and see the ground breaking work underway,\" Cumberland Council councilor Anne Quilter said in the press release.\nBritain was occupied by Rome from A.D. 43 to A.D. 410—with Carlisle located along Hadrian's Wall, which marked the boundary between the empire and the unconquered territories to the north.\nDo you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?

        "content": "Archaeologists investigating a submerged prehistoric settlement have found that it surprisingly managed to survive a period of climate instability that occurred around 8,200 years ago.\nThe village, dubbed Habonim North, now lies below the Mediterranean Sea off the Carmel Coast of Israel, at a depth of around 8 to 10 feet below the surface. Prior to the latest research, almost nothing was known about the settlement aside from its location.\nBut now a team of experts involving researchers from the University of California, San Diego, as well as the University of Haifa (UH) and Bar-Ilan University in Israel, have begun to unravel its secrets in a study published in the journal Antiquity.\nThe research included the first formal excavation of the submerged site, which was first discovered in the mid-2010s and later identified during a survey led by Ehud Arkin Shalev with UH—one of the authors of the study.\n\"The site was re-discovered during our team's surveys. At first, we thought it was a site related to a later archaeological period,\" Roey Nickelsberg, a Ph.D. candidate with UH's Department of Maritime Civilizations, who co-led the excavations, told Newsweek.\nHowever, after examining the finds, including organic remains that the team managed to radiocarbon date, the researchers determined that the site was occupied during the Early Pottery Neolithic period (around 6400–5500 B.C.) of the southern Levant, around the time of a phenomenon that scientists call the \"8.2 ka\" climatic event.\nNickelsberg said it was \"absolutely a surprise\" to find that Habonim North likely dated to this period.\n\"There are many submerged sites in this area but they are all from a later or earlier period,\" he said. \"And and on land there is very limited evidence for settlement during this period, so to identify an active permanent settlement was surprising and exciting.\"\nThe scarcity of contemporary sites in the region potentially reflects the impact of the 8.2ka event, which as the name suggests, took place around 8,200 years ago—or 6200 B.C. The event was characterized by a sudden drop in global temperatures that may have occurred over the space of just few decades. In total, the event may have lasted for roughly a couple of centuries, or more.\nDuring the event, the eastern Mediterranean region, where Israel lies, experienced increasingly arid conditions, effectively resulting in drought across many areas. This would likely have affected the farming communities that were beginning to emerge during this period.\n\"The impact could have been devastating on Neolithic farming communities,\"\nAssaf Yasur-Landau, head of the Recanati Institute for Maritime Studies at UH, who co-led the excavations at Habonim North, told Newsweek.\nPreviously, archaeologists believed that the climate event may have led to the widespread abandonment of coastal settlements in the southern Levant, such as Habonim North.\n\"During the time period related to the 8.2ka event, there seemed to have been no permanent coastal settlements, and, therefore, it was assumed that the coast was abandoned and then resettled later,\" Nickelsberg said.\nBut the latest study suggests that at least one village remained occupied throughout the period of climate instability.\nThe team's investigations at the site uncovered a variety of remains, including pottery shards, stone tools (such as ceremonial weapons and possible fishing net weights), animal and plant remains, and traces of architecture.\nThe researchers managed to date some of the organic remains using radiocarbon techniques, including those of wild and domesticated animals, as well as the charred seeds of plants. This work—alongside an analysis of the other remains—helped to date the site to the Early Pottery Neolithic, which coincided with the 8.2ka event, not to mention the emergence of pottery in the Levant region.\n\"It was only after our first excavation season when we analyzed the finds and applied radiocarbon dating to the site that we understood the site was in the ballpark of the 8.2ka climate event,\" Tom Levy, a co-author on the paper with the UC San Diego Center for Cyber-Archaeology and Sustainability at the Qualcomm Institute, told Newsweek.\nIt is unclear exactly how the prehistoric inhabitants of Habonim North survived, or even what impacts the 8.2ka event had on them. But the settlement—which had access to marine resources, as well as farmland for growing crops—provides some clues, displaying evidence of a diverse economy.\nThe ability to extract both marine resources (such as fish, shrimp, crab, lobster, clams, mussels, oysters, octopus) and land-based agricultural resources (for example, cereals, meat from wild game and domestic animals, as well as their secondary products, like milk) may have provided these early farmer-fishers with a \"flexible strategy to survive,\" Levy said.\nFurthermore, the inhabitants would have been able to store their surplus with the novel technology of pottery. There is even evidence that the settlement may have engaged in trade or exchange with other communities, which would have boosted its resilience by providing access to additional resource streams.\n\"In Habonim North we have an exciting window into life in a crucial period within the Neolithic—the beginning of the use of pottery,\" Yasur-Landau said. \"The ability to store goods in containers, as well as to cook and serve food in ceramic pots and bowls, changed society for millennia. It's astonishing that even in this very early stage, the pottery at the site came from different sources. It is possible that we have the beginning of trade in both vessels, as well as in agricultural products stored in vessels.\"\nThe results of the study indicate that at least some early Neolithic societies in the region were \"resilient and sustainable\" in the face of abrupt climatic changes, according to the researchers.\nDo you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?

        "content": "Having a gas stove in your home is bad for your health, researchers have found, and it could kill thousands of people across the country every year.\nPeople living in homes with a gas or propane stove breathe unhealthy amounts of nitrogen dioxide or NO₂, one of the pollutants from car exhaust, according to a paper in the online journal Science Advances. Long-term exposure to this NO₂ could trigger asthma in hundreds of thousands of people, as well as killing as many as 19,000 people annually.\nThis finding comes as the U.S. Department of Energy announced new energy-efficiency guidelines for gas and electric stoves earlier this year, which has brought a backlash.\nGas stoves work by burning gases, usually natural gas—a mixture of hydrocarbons but mostly methane—or propane. This burning can release byproducts, including harmful gases like carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides like NO₂.\nNO₂ primarily affects the respiratory system. It can cause or worsen respiratory diseases, particularly asthma, leading to symptoms like wheezing, coughing, colds, flu and bronchitis. Prolonged exposure can decrease lung function and increase the risk of respiratory infections.\nThere is also some evidence that NO₂ can exacerbate existing heart conditions, leading to increased hospital admissions and even premature death. Long-term exposure to NO₂ may also affect the development of the lungs in children.\nAround 38 percent of U.S. households have gas stoves, according to the federal Energy Information Administration, although certain states have much higher numbers of gas stoves than others.\nPollutant gases from gas and propane stoves may be responsible for as many as 200,000 current childhood asthma cases, 25 percent of which are due to NO₂ alone, the paper said.\n\"We found that just how much gas you burn in your stove is by far the biggest factor affecting how much you're exposed. And then, after that, do you have an effective range hood—and do you use it?\" said study co-author Yannai Kashtan, a Ph.D. student in Earth system science at Stanford University, in a statement.\nThe researchers also found that long-term exposure to the NO₂ in American households with gas stoves may lead to 40 percent as many deaths as those caused by secondhand smoke, which comes to around 19,000 people each year. This estimate doesn't even factor in the short bursts of NO₂ that are often seen in homes with gas stoves.\n\"I didn't expect to see pollutant concentrations breach health benchmarks in bedrooms within an hour of gas stove use and stay there for hours after the stove is turned off,\" study author Rob Jackson, a professor in Earth system science at Stanford, said in the statement. \"It's the whole family's problem.\"\nUsing a gas or propane stove in the home increases exposure to NO₂ by an estimated 4 parts per billion on average during a year, which is about three-quarters of the way toward the NO₂ exposure level classified as unsafe in outdoor air by the World Health Organization.\n\"That's excluding all outdoor sources combined, so it makes it much more likely you're going to exceed the limit,\" said Kashtan.\nThe paper also reveals that smaller homes are more at risk of these effects, with people in small two-bed apartments being exposed to around twice as much NO₂ as the national average and four times that of people living in homes over 3,000 square feet.\n\"Electric stoves emit no nitrogen dioxide or benzene. If you own a gas or propane stove, you need to reduce pollutant exposures using ventilation,\" Jackson said.\nThe effect of home sizes means that there is a major trend in NO₂ exposure among those with low incomes as well as racial and ethnic groups. The paper found that American Indian and Alaska Native households had a 60 percent higher exposure to NO₂ than average, while Black and Hispanic or Latino households had a 20 percent higher exposure than average. This also is compounded by the fact that these communities may be exposed to higher levels of NO₂ from other sources, including vehicle exhaust.\n\"People in poorer communities can't always afford to change their appliances, or perhaps they rent and can't replace appliances because they don't own them,\" Jackson said. \"People in smaller homes are also breathing more pollution for the same stove use.\"\nDo you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?

        "content": "Following the Miami Sprint race, FIA stewards have proposed a review of penalty systems for repeat offenses. This development followed a series of penalties issued to Haas driver Kevin Magnussen for multiple track excursions while battling with Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton.\nDuring the recent Miami Sprint, an intense on-track battle between Kevin Magnussen and Lewis Hamilton caught the attention of the FIA stewards. Magnussen, who was penalized three times for leaving the track, has now become the focal point in a broader discussion about the adequacy of current penalty regulations concerning repeated infringements.\nKevin Magnussen, in his post-race comments to Sky Sports F1, acknowledged the fairness of the penalties assessed against him. He explained his race tactics, which were primarily designed to assist his teammate, Nico Hulkenberg. He explained:\n\"All the penalties were well deserved - no doubt about it. I was in a very good position behind Nico there. In the beginning of the race, I gained a lot of positions and was up in P8. I was protecting well from Lewis because I had the DRS from Nico and I had good pace.\n\"Then Nico cut the chicane and I lost the DRS. Nico could have given that back to give me the DRS to protect because then we would have easily been P7 and P8. Instead, I was really vulnerable to Lewis. Started fighting with him like crazy and I had to just create the gap like I did in Jeddah.\n\"I started using these stupid tactics which I don't like doing, but at the end of the day I did my job as a team player and Nico scored his points because I got that gap for him so Lewis and Tsunoda couldn't catch him.\n\"Not the way I like to go racing at all, but it was what I had to do today.\"\nThe stewards, upon reviewing the incidents, cleared Magnussen of any unsportsmanlike behavior and recognized his acceptance of the standard penalties. The stewards' report highlighted as quoted by Motorsport Week:\n\"The driver candidly explained that he thought that he was entitled to race with Car 44 in the manner that he did and also that he was willing to accept what he considered to be standard penalties that would have been imposed on him for any infringements that occurred while he was battling for position.\n\"He was also of the view that building a gap between himself and the cars ahead was perfectly within the regulations and it was not uncommon for a driver to seek to assist his team-mate in the course of a race by doing so.\n\"He did not at any point in time think that what he was doing was wrong or that it was in any way unsportsmanlike.\"\nIn light of these events, the stewards have suggested a review of the penalty system for repeat offenses, signaling a potential shift in how future races might be regulated. They noted the necessity of enhancing penalties to deter drivers from repeatedly leaving the track, thereby maintaining the integrity of the sport.\nThe report from the Stewards continued:\n\"Moving forward, the Stewards will need to consider if, in appropriate situations, especially in the case of repeat infringements, the penalties to be applied for each infringement need to be increased to discourage scenarios such as those that we found today.\n\"This is something that we will raise explicitly with the FIA and the Stewarding team.\"\n",

        "content": "Following another defeat in the Super Bowl, once again at the hands of the Kansas City Chiefs, the San Francisco 49ers entered the offseason wondering what went wrong. San Francisco has been so close to getting itself back to the mountaintop, only to see everything crumble right before its eyes.\nThe 49ers changed quarterbacks and brought in more offensive weapons to counter the Chiefs, only for the same result to occur as did during their prior Super Bowl encounter. The 49ers' front office has taken a long look at where else the team could tweak its roster, bringing about rumors of San Francisco moving off one or both of its two-star wide receivers. Both Deebo Samuel and Brandon Aiyuk are looking for massive contract extensions, something that the 49ers will need to address at some point.\nWhile trade rumors swirled, 49ers general manager John Lynch fueled the fire by drafting wide receiver Ricky Pearsall out of the University of Florida in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft.\nLynch appeared on ESPN's \"The Pat McAfee Show\" and addressed the rumors that the 49ers may be looking to move off one of, or even both, receivers this offseason.\n\"I love our roster,\" Lynch said. \"I love the way it's comprised. As I said, we were right there. And we got to find a way to get just a little bit better. And I'm doing everything in my power to keep our roster together and that's my goal.\"\nHere are three intriguing possible landing spots for either Samuel or Aiyuk, if the 49ers do move on from them:\n1. Pittsburgh Steelers\nIf there is any club that needs to land a big-time wide receiver, it's the Pittsburgh Steelers. After trading away Diontae Johnson this offseason, the Steelers are left relying on George Pickens to be their top option. They did draft Roman Wilson out of Michigan, but relying on a rookie can be tough.\nIf Pittsburgh were to land either Samuel or Aiyuk, it could be a game-changer within the AFC North. Landing either one of them could vault the Steelers toward the top of the division, and would give presumed starting quarterback Russell Wilson some talent to work with. Don't sleep on Pittsburgh being aggressive here after a great offseason so far.\n2. Buffalo Bills\nAfter trading away Stefon Diggs and letting Gabe Davis walk, the Bills find themselves in a precarious spot at the wide receiver position. While the team did draft Keon Johnson and sign Chase Claypool, Buffalo could use a star.\nSomeone like Samuel or Aiyuk would help this offense thrive and give quarterback Josh Allen a true No. 1 option to throw too. Buffalo has been aggressive in the past in making trades, so there is no reason to think they won't be here.\n3. Washington Commanders\nAfter drafting No. 2 overall pick Jayden Daniels, Washington needs to surround the exciting young quarterback with weapons to throw the ball too. While they have Terry McLaurin, they could use another star next to him. Either Samuel or Aiyuk would do wonders for this Commanders offense and the team has all their draft picks for the next few years.\nSan Francisco could easily recoup some draft capital here and use Pearsall to fill the void. Washington makes a lot of sense but the 49ers may want to push for a trade to an AFC squad instead.\n",

Ham was hired just two years ago and had taken the team to the Western Conference Finals a year ago, but in the world that is the Lakers, that isn't good enough. Los Angeles demands excellence from its team and coaching staff, something Ham couldn't live up to.\nHe came under fire this past season due to his inability to make in-game adjustments when needed. Ham also never took accountability for his mistakes, something that rubbed the players and organization the wrong way.\nLos Angeles will now be looking for their third head coaching hire since 2020 and they are hoping the third time is the charm. Los Angeles wants stability at the coaching position, but the club's inability to identify the right person for the job has been troubling.\nRumors have been flying about the potential of them going after Tyronn Lue if he is let go by the Los Angeles Clippers, but all signs point to the two sides staying together.\nIn fact, Lue mentioned that he hopes to stay with the Clippers for a long time. He has built up strong relationships with members of the Clippers' front office and would love to continue working alongside them, per Ohm Youngmisuk and Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN:\nLue likely staying with the Clippers would serve as a blow to the Lakers' plans. But even if Lue did want to join the Lakers, Los Angeles would need to give the Clippers some type of compensation, unless he was fired. Clippers owner Steve Ballmer isn't just going to hand Lue over to the inter-city rivals so a firing is unlikely.\nThe connection that Lue has with Lakers superstar LeBron James has made him their primary target. Lue led James' Cleveland Cavaliers clubs to three consecutive NBA Finals appearances from 2016-18, including a win in '16.\nBut Los Angeles will likely have to look elsewhere for its new head coach. Names such as Mike Budenholzer, Kenny Atkinson, and JJ Redick have surfaced for the Lakers, but they are expected to take their time executing interviews.\nThe hope for the Lakers is that they can find the right person to lead the ship forward, maximizing the potential of the roster that the front office puts together. James can become a free agent this summer as well, but all indications are that he will remain with the team for his final few years in the NBA. As it always is for the Lakers, it will be a drama-filled summer but one that could dictate how the next decade goes for this franchise.\n",

Once again, injuries were the narrative of their season but this time, the organization may have drastic changes coming. Stars Paul George and James Harden could both leave the team in free agency, even if reports say that the organization wants to keep them together.\nHarden is an actual free agent, with George needing to decline his player option to become one. Harden has become somewhat of a negative asset to his teams over the years, even if he put together a good showing with the Clippers this season.\nLos Angeles will need to decide if they want to commit long-term to this unit, which includes retaining Harden despite his poor playoff struggles again.\nIf Harden does leave the Clippers, there will be interested teams. Here are five potential landing spots for the former MVP this summer.\n1. Los Angeles Clippers\nIn most scenarios, Harden will end up back with the Clippers. However, nothing is a forgone conclusion within the NBA. But the veteran guard seemed happy to be in his hometown.\nHarden said after Game 6 that he wasn't sure what he would do regarding his contract. But he would probably prefer to stay with the Clippers if possible.\n\"I don't even know,\" Harden reflected postgame, per Ohm Youngmisuk of ESPN. Harden finished with 16 points, 13 assists and seven rebounds Friday but missed all six of his three-point attempts. \"You are asking a lot of questions that I don't have the answer to or haven't even thought about.\"\nHarden wasn't a full distraction for this Clippers team, something he has had issues with in the past. Unless something drastic happens, such as contract negotiations go south, expect Harden to be back with the Clippers next year.\n2. San Antonio Spurs\nThe Spurs were once a proud organization and the class of the NBA. But multiple poor seasons in a row have left them reeling and searching for any sign of hope. Landing the No. 1 pick in the 2023 NBA Draft last season has seemed to do the trick and Victor Wembanyama looks like the next NBA superstar.\nPairing Harden up with Wembanyama could be scary for the rest of the league. The pick-and-roll offense alone would be lethal, creating relevance for the Spurs once again. San Antonio may need to make some moves to open more cap space up to outright sign the former MVP or they could try to pull a sign-and-trade with the Clippers.\n3. Orlando Magic\nThe Magic are still in the playoffs, currently preparing to face off in a Game 7 against the Cleveland Cavaliers. But Orlando has grown up a lot this season. They still need a point guard to help run the offense and Harden could be the missing piece for them.\nPairing up with young sensation Paolo Banchero could be interesting, giving the Magic more credibility within the Eastern Conference. Orlando should have plenty of cap space to work with this summer, opening the door to them landing Harden without giving anything up.\n4. New Orleans Pelicans\nNew Orleans was swept out of the postseason by the Oklahoma City Thunder this season and changes are likely coming to them as well. The Pelicans could use a more true point guard to take guard CJ McCollum off the ball, potentially opening the door for Harden to come in.\nThe Pelicans would likely need to make a trade to land Harden so a sign-and-trade may be possible. In the event that George departs the Clippers, maybe they'll look to New Orleans for Brandon Ingram. A swap of Harden for Ingram, with some extra pieces included, could work out well for both sides.\nEvan Sidery of Forbes reported that New Orleans isn't likely to offer Ingram a contract extension and that they could move him this summer. Landing Harden would be a financial commitment for the Pelicans but not as much if they were to extend Ingram.\nNew Orleans would get a point guard who can facilitate the offense around Zion Williamson, and the Clippers would replace George with a younger, more lengthy forward. It could be a win-win for both sides if the normally disgruntled Harden has his eyes set on New Orleans.\n5. Houston Rockets\nJust last season, the Rockets were one of the top landing spots for Harden, but nothing ever materialized. Could Houston look to their former star to once again help lift them forward?\nIt's possible but unlikely. The biggest hurdle was Rockets head coach Ime Udoka not being too big of a fan of bringing Harden back.\n\"Nothing against James,\" Udoka told Zach Lowe of ESPN, \"but Fred is just a better fit. I coached James in Brooklyn. He's one of the smartest players I've ever been around. The words 'Ime doesn't want James' never came out of my mouth. It was, 'Let's look at the best fit.'\nThe Rockets have created a strong culture without him so going back to him could ruin that. Houston is never out of the running when it comes to Harden but it's the least likely from this list of teams.\n",

The rebuke follows Wolff's comments admiring Verstappen amidst Mercedes' pursuit of replacing seven-time F1 champion Lewis Hamilton who is set to join Ferrari in 2025.\nMintzlaff, responding to Wolff's comments, firmly reestablished Verstappen's commitment to Red Bull. He articulated the importance of the Mercedes chief focusing on internal team challenges rather than eyeing talents contracted with rival teams.\n\"This is a decision that Max needs to take, but there is no team up and down the grid that wouldn't do handstands to have him in the car,\" Wolff had previously stated as quoted by ESPN, acknowledging the allure Verstappen holds across the Formula 1 grid. He added, touching on the difficulties that the team has faced with the ground-effect cars, \"I'd love to have him, but first we need to sort out our car. First, we owe it to George [Russell] and Lewis [Hamilton] to improve the car and give them equipment that is good before dreaming about the future next year.\"\nCountering this, Mintzlaff was explicit in his disapproval of Wolff's public courtship of Verstappen. \"I understand the pressure that Toto Wolff and perhaps other teams have after years of being behind, but I think Toto should concentrate on his challenges. He has enough of those,\" Mintzlaff expressed in an interview with Bild Am Sonntag, as quoted by Pit Pass. He underscored the disrespect perceived in discussing another team's key assets, stating, \"It also has something to do with respect. If I keep talking about the personnel of other teams, that's not right.\"\nMintzlaff also highlighted that Verstappen has not shown any desire to abandon his current team, reinforcing the strong relationship and trust built between him and Red Bull's leadership, including Christian Horner and Helmut Marko.\n\"Max still has a long-term contract here and hasn't said a word that he doesn't want to fulfil it,\" he said. \"I'm not at all worried that he's considering a move. Things just have to calm down again now. That's what Max wants, and that's what we want too.\n\"At least I can't think of any. Max wants the fastest car... we have this. Max wants to become world champion... with us, he has the best chances.\n\"Max is a loyal guy,\" he added. \"He knows that Christian Horner and Helmut Marko have always placed their trust in him. He appreciates that. In addition, Red Bull is simply a great brand that he can extremely identify with. So there are many reasons for staying, and none against.\"\nAdditionally, Mintzlaff addressed the shocking exit of Chief Technical Officer Adrian Newey, who will be leaving the team in 2025. He commented:\n\"Adrian has done great things here over the years and played a big part in us winning 13 world championship titles.\n\"It's obviously a shame that he's leaving us, but we discussed it in a very fair and respectful dialogue. What he leaves behind is not only a unique legacy but also a structure that he helped to build.\n\"Of course, we will miss him, also as a person, but tomorrow we will still know how to build a very fast Formula 1 car.\"\n",

        "content": "Many consequences of cyber breaches have been well-documented, including financial and reputational damage. Recent developments, however, show that another serious consequence stands to become top of mind for business leaders: legal action against both the management and members of the boards of directors of organizations that suffer cyber breaches.\nAccording to cybersecurity expert Joseph Steinberg, the SEC's recent charges against the chief information security officer (CISO) of SolarWinds, combined with its new cybersecurity disclosure rules, should leave no doubt in anyone's mind that the government is demanding companies to \"get their cybersecurity houses in order.\"\n\"In a worst-case scenario, a cyber breach could lead to criminal charges against people,\" Steinberg says. \"We are talking about not only financial penalties, but, under some circumstances, potential prison time.\"\nThe SEC's filing against the SolarWinds CISO is not the first instance in the United States of criminal charges being leveled against a cybersecurity professional. Steinberg points to the case of former Uber chief security officer (CSO) Joseph Sullivan, who, until his sentencing, faced potential prison time for his role in the attempted covering up of a 2016 data breach that exposed personal information for more than 50 million customers of the ride-hailing platform. According to an article in SC Media, the former Uber CSO was ultimately punished with a probation sentence, a fine and a requirement to perform community service \"tied to a cover-up of Uber's 2016 breach.\"\nHowever, the SEC's new disclosure rules and its charges against the SolarWinds CISO have potentially changed the equation for companies when it comes to cyber breaches, Steinberg explains. The federal government is taking cyber breaches seriously, and company leaders should heed the recent news as a warning.\n\"Essentially, the onus has shifted as to who is responsible,\" Steinberg says. \"Instead of viewing cyber incidents as something that happened to a company, as something that doesn't necessarily need to be explicitly explained in filings or revealed to the public, the new rules basically say that if an incident occurs, the company's management and board are responsible to ensure that they adequately explain to the world what happened.\"\nSteinberg stresses that being upfront with investors about material cyber risks is paramount. In short, investors need to know what a company is doing to address cyber threats, how it has historically handled any cyber incidents, what damages have occurred due to any past cyber incidents and what damages are at risk of happening due to potential future cyber incidents.\n\"Someone's decision to invest in a company can be dramatically impacted by information about cyber risks,\" Steinberg says, adding that by not being upfront about cyber risks and incidents, companies could be misleading the public — which can reasonably be considered akin to \"falsifying a financial statement.\"\nPer analysis by Thomson Reuters, it's \"not explicitly mandated\" in the SEC's new rules, but \"firms are expected to provide details on board proficiency in cybersecurity.\" The directive from the SEC makes it clear that public corporations have \"to describe the board of directors' oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats and management's role and expertise in assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats.\"\nTo comply with the SEC's new rules around cybersecurity, companies need board members with the right type of cybersecurity experience and skills, Steinberg says.\n\"Companies need people on their boards who can oversee the management of cyber risk, not people who are technically savvy but do not understand how to ensure that the business is properly managing cyber risk,\" he says. \"The board must oversee the management of cyber risk rather than seeking to perform or actively manage the job of the CISO.\"\nUnfortunately, many companies do not have board members with adequate, appropriate cyber expertise. Findings from 2023 research conducted by WSJ Pro revealed that the \"number of directors at S&P 500 companies who have cybersecurity experience has increased sharply since\" 2022; however, the \"amount of cybersecurity expertise on boards remains relatively low, at a time when boards are under increased scrutiny for security failings.\" Specifically, the research found that as of August 31, 2023, \"107 directors at 113 companies had professional experience in cybersecurity.\"\nBut Steinberg cautions against boards rushing the process of signing on people with cybersecurity expertise.\n\"One of the problems that many boards face is that they bring on people who aren't necessarily skilled at overseeing cybersecurity,\" Steinberg says. \"Just because someone is an excellent baseball player does not mean that he will make an excellent team manager, and just because someone is an excellent manager does not mean that he will make an excellent team CEO. The same is true when it comes to managing and overseeing cyber risk. Boards need the right combination of experience, skills and talent to properly handle cyber risk, as opposed to merely thinking they are handling it well.\"\nTo that end, Steinberg emphasizes that it is vital for companies to empower the right people to play the right roles when it comes to cybersecurity. Specifically, CISOs, CSOs and other cyber experts should manage cybersecurity and should ensure that the necessary parties perform what is needed in order to handle day-to-day tasks and to develop and implement broader strategies. Board members should oversee the party managing cybersecurity to make sure that the cybersecurity program provides the company with adequate protection (as agreed upon by the board) against cyber risk.\n\"One of the issues that I see develop on a regular basis is board members getting overly involved in what they think is the oversight of cyber risk—but is actually the management or performance of it,\" Steinberg says. \"In turn, they end up wasting time and energy discussing matters that should be left to the CISO.\"\nHe notes that when board members attempt to take cybersecurity fully under their control, it takes away their focus from other elements of the business—and can make a company more exposed than if the management of cyber risk was properly overseen by the right experts.\n\"Board members who do not understand their appropriate role in dealing with cybersecurity and cyber risk can end up interfering with the CISO or CSO's ability to do their job,\" Steinberg says. \"Additionally, the failure of board members to understand where they fall into a company's cybersecurity and cyber risk management efforts can cause the board as a whole to become distracted—and in turn, fail to address pressing matters across the business.\"\nUltimately, he says, those organizations that do not yet have cybersecurity expertise present on their boards should take action now.\n\"In the same way that you wouldn't have a board that lacks accounting and legal expertise, you shouldn't have a board without cybersecurity expertise,\" Steinberg says. \"For many companies, a cyber incident is more likely to pose serious danger than accounting or legal issues.\"\nIdeally, he says, companies should appoint people who are \"familiar with the management of information security and cybersecurity.\"\n\"To not have that level of expertise is like presenting financial documents to board members with little to no accounting knowledge,\" Steinberg says.\n",

        "content": "U.S. Drone Soccer and Robofest transcend the conventional, molding competition and education into a concrete forge where future innovators are tempered. Within these crucibles of creativity and scientific rigor, young minds are not just honed — they are transformed, contesting the orthodoxy that separates the intellectual from the intuitive. Both opportunities herald a paradigm shift in pedagogy, where students engage in entirely new dimensions of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) competitiveness.\nU.S. Drone Soccer is where technology and teamwork ascend to new heights, showcasing a sport redefined by innovation and strategic ingenuity. This competition goes far beyond the traditional confines of athletic endeavor, melding the physical with the intellectual, to craft an environment where students are not just athletes but innovators and strategists. The drone soccer ball, a symbol of technological accessibility and creativity, serves as a testament to the power of STEM education, remodeling students from passive learners into active makers and problem-solvers.\nU.S. Drone Soccer is a well-founded educational experience that challenges students to build, program, and pilot their drones. This hands-on approach not only cements theoretical knowledge but also imbues students with a sense of kinesthetic accomplishment and a drive to explore new technological frontiers. Through the meticulous construction and programming of drones, participants learn the criticality of every component, the value of persistence, and the joy of collective achievement.\nAs educators lead these young innovators through the intricacies of the assembly process and flight dynamics, they are nurturing a future workforce equipped with the skills necessary for the challenges of tomorrow. The U.S. Drone Soccer Association, now boasting over 200 programs nationwide, is working to satisfy the growing demand for immersive, technologically oriented education.\nFrom its inception in early 2020, sparked by the World Air Sports Federation's recognition of the untapped potential within the U.S. market, U.S. Drone Soccer has swiftly ascended from a nascent sport to a national phenomenon — with worldwide ambitions. The establishment of the U.S. Drone Soccer Association and the development of an FAI-compliant drone soccer ball assembly kit mark significant milestones in this journey.\nWith the success of the first-ever National Championship in 2023 and the remarkable triumph of the Sato Academy Red Dragons in international competition, U.S. Drone Soccer has proven its efficacy as a platform for global achievement. The anticipation for the 2024 National Championship, set against the backdrop of Virginia's technological landscape, hints at the burgeoning legacy of this pioneering sport.\nAs we pivot from aerial feats and teamwork epitomized by drone soccer, we turn our gaze to the ground, where another form of competition beckons.\nRobofest, emerging from the ingenuity of Lawrence Technological University, stands as a bastion of innovation and a celebration of the mind's limitless potential. This festival, a symphony of autonomous robotics, unfurls a canvas where students from diverse backgrounds converge to weave the threads of STEAM (STEM + Arts) and computer science into a tapestry of ingenuity and fun. Here, robots become more than metal and code; they are recast as vehicles of learning, embodiments of students' creativity and problem-solving prowess.\nThe historical evolution of Robofest is a narrative of continuous innovation and pedagogical refinement. Since its inception in the 1999-2000 academic year, the festival has been a cradle of self-directed learning, encouraging students to transcend the boundaries of fixed rules and venture into realms of unfettered creativity and innovation. The introduction of the exhibition category and the Unknown Mission Challenge exemplify Robofest's commitment to nurturing critical thinking and adaptability, empowering students to tackle unforeseen challenges with grace and ingenuity.\nAs Robofest evolved, it embraced the arts, merging technology with creativity in RoboParade and the Global Robotics Art Festival, and later, RoboArts. These events exemplify the fusion of engineering and artistry, highlighting the holistic nature of STEAM education and the importance of integrating diverse disciplines to foster well-rounded learning experiences.\nThe small team sizes at Robofest are not by mere chance but by design, ensuring that each participant engages deeply with the material and contributes meaningfully to their team's objectives. This philosophy has cultivated an environment where learning is intimate, collaborative, and profoundly impactful.\nFrom the Vision Centric Challenge, inspired by the DARPA Urban Challenge, to the foundational Robot Sumo and its evolved counterpart, BottleSumo, Robofest has continually expanded its horizons, offering myriad avenues for students to explore, learn, and grow. The WISER conference and collaboration with AccelerateKID stands as a testament to the community's dedication to advancing robotics education, providing a platform for sharing knowledge and fostering a global dialogue on the future of STEAM learning.\nThe journey of Robofest, marked by its adaptability, innovation, and commitment to education, mirrors the broader narrative of technology's role in shaping our future. Here, amidst the buzzing servos and whirring motors, students find not only a competition but a gateway to the future, a place where the lessons of today become the breakthroughs of tomorrow. This convergence of past achievements and future aspirations is not just the story of Robofest but a reflection of the transformative power of education in the technological age.\nAs we close this chapter of innovation and discovery, let it not signify an end but a call to action for the next wave of pioneers in STEM. U.S. Drone Soccer and Robofest are more than competitions; they are catalysts for a collaborative future, a summons to stakeholders at all levels — from vendors and sponsors to mentors, teams, and volunteers — to join hands in shaping the next generation.\nLet this be your invitation to forge the future, to be part of a community dedicated to advancing the frontiers of knowledge and innovation. Dive into the heart of these competitions, lend your expertise, your enthusiasm, and your support. Together, we can build parallel systems that not only celebrate the triumphs of competition but also cultivate the growth of the individuals and teams who will lead us into tomorrow.\n",

        "content": "Recent statistics pointing to employee training fatigue, particularly in the context of IT and security training, highlight a growing concern about the effectiveness of training programs and their ability to adequately engage employees. This is not only true among the general population of employees, but also among IT staff members. One study found that 25% of IT security professionals are seriously considering leaving their jobs — 24% are considering leaving the profession entirely.\nA related concern — especially as many organizations have transferred much of their learning and development (L&D) activities into the digital realm, is growing fatigue related to digital overload. This overload, along with a proliferation of communication channels, is leading to a drop in engagement with cybersecurity training — 45% say that this overload is reducing their ability to effectively identify and respond to cybersecurity threats.\nThat's a situation that organizations and their HR and L&D staff need to be aware of and take steps to address. Here are some ways you can improve your cybersecurity awareness training efforts to achieve better results.\nMost cybersecurity training — in fact, most corporate training, in general — tends to be all too painfully similar. The pandemic drove many training efforts online and there many stayed. There's a benefit in being able to access training on-demand, but there can be tedium too. While this mainstay format may be part of your training efforts, consider ways you might dare to be different when providing cybersecurity training.\nSuggestions:\n• Random, interactive polls in a competitive format with \"winners\" applauded and \"losers\" privately provided with personalized coaching.\n• Pop-up news notifications challenges. When a breach occurs at an organization like yours, push the news out to staff along with a challenge question. For instance: \"What steps could you personally take to help prevent something like this from happening at our office?\" Share the best responses at an all-hands meeting or in the company newsletter.\n• Provide training in tidbits. Arm managers and supervisors with brief key points or messages that can be shared in bite-sized pieces, quickly, during staff meetings.\n• User-generated content. Get employees involved by challenging them to create brief TikTok-like videos highlighting important cybersecurity points in a fun and entertaining way. Offer prizes for the best/most liked content.\nThere are a variety of ways that you can think creatively about how to deliver security awareness training. While traditional training may still be your mainstay, think of ways you could enliven it by adding some additional, innovative, and interactive training options.\nConsider how you might incorporate best practices into all your security awareness training efforts.\nRudimentary forms of training can be traced back to prehistoric times. Corporate training also has a long history. R. Hoe and Company is credited with offering the first form of workplace training back in 1872. You'd think we would have picked up some good best practices over the past 150 years. And we have.\n• Provide variety. Mix up your content delivery by incorporating a balance of lectures with interactive elements like quizzes, polls, group discussions, and simulations.\n• Incorporate gamification. People like competition. Augment training with competitions, leaderboards, rewards, and prizes.\n• Offer flexibility and variation. Employee learning preferences are varied; training offers should be, too.\n• Make it visually appealing — and modern. Today's employees are used to consuming information in highly visual, often entertaining formats — think YouTube and Instagram.\n• Make it relevant. Make sure it's clear to your employee learners why this information is important, and relevant, to them. Yes, it will benefit the organization. But what will they, personally, get out of it? Hint: employees have security-related concerns just like your organization does. How can this information help them protect their family data and devices?\n• Make it personalized. Don't create a one-size-fits-all training course because one size doesn't fit all. For instance, the information required by the IT staff will differ from that needed by employees in the marketing department. Don't force them to consume the same information.\n• Seek ongoing feedback from employees and managers to learn how training can be made more engaging and impactful. Do employees feel the training was relevant and enjoyable? Did they learn something? Are managers and supervisors seeing the information impacting behaviors?\n• Track progress continually — not just learner sentiment about the training but actual organizational impact. Has security awareness improved? Have incidents lessened or have reports increased? Have specific goals related to your cybersecurity awareness training and measure against those goals. Share results with employees, and thank them for their efforts in helping to achieve goals. Enlist their support to close identified gaps.\n• Commit to continuous improvement. Security awareness is a journey, not a destination. You will never achieve 100% success, but you can achieve incremental improvement over time.\nEmployee training fatigue is real. But it doesn't have to be a constraint on your training efforts. Think of ways you can approach training differently to better engage employees. What new methods and techniques will you implement to combat training fatigue?\n",

Click here for the full series page.\nWhen the iPhone came out in 2005, I wasn't among the first in line, but I did buy one. Two weeks later, surprised that my new device was doing exactly what it was designed to do—addicting me—I replaced it with a no-frills Nokia, which I used for the next thirteen years.\nThen, on January 15, 2018, I put my Nokia in a drawer forever. Why? Because I'm haunted by the image of myself looking at my phone to the exclusion of everything else around me. Mostly I remember resenting that a cartoonish cube of metal and glass had taken control of my life. The \"endless and proper work\" of paying attention is an essential part of the work I do. Why would I use something that compromised my ability to be great at my job?\nEven though I'm currently in my sixth year without a phone, I decided to reach out to Nir Eyal, named by The M.I.T. Technology Review as, \"The Prophet of Habit-Forming Technology,\" to try to get to the bottom of phone addiction and understand why we check our phones even though we haven't received any notifications.\nEyal is the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products and Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life, selling over 1 million copies in over 30 languages.\nThe conversation proved fascinating — despite our differences, I was amazed to find an astounding number of similarities. I also came away having learned a few tricks that I still use to this day.\nSay, for example, you're at a business dinner and one of the patrons is constantly looking down at their phone. Instead of ignoring them, Nir's strategy is to confront them with concern: ask them in a sincere way: \"I can see that you're on the phone a lot – is everything okay – is there anything I can do to help?\"\nAs we dug deeper towards the root question that inspired our sit down, Nir's explanations brought me back to my own decision to get rid of my phone. Our phones are a form of armor. A shield. A light saber. A one-handed defense against our own fear, anxiety, aloneness, self-consciousness, stillness, sadness, and insignificance. A notification means someone cares. It means that we're important.\nI get it.\nAnd yet, when I'm walking along the street and someone glued to his or her phone crashes into me, followed by a quick, rueful \"Sorry...\" I can't help feeling an irrational rage. \"Don't you understand what you're doing?\" I want to say. Is this really how you want to spend your one wild and precious life?\n",

Why do we procrastinate on taxes?\nWhether we like to admit it, we've all been there. Breaking up, fixing that dripping tap, learning that new skill — the list goes on. A friend of mine recently procrastinated on his health check, likely suspecting that the message he would receive wouldn't be rosy. According to a recent study, 20 to 25 percent of the adult population procrastinates regularly, while a staggering 70 to 95 percent of all students report procrastinating on academic tasks.\nAnd then there's that dreaded tax return hanging over our heads.\nSo I sat down with economist Richard Thaler — recipient of the 2017 Nobel Prize for his pioneering contributions to behavioral economics and best-selling author of the book, Nudge. Thaler's work fundamentally challenged the traditional economic assumption that individuals always act rationally, laying the groundwork for the concept of \"nudge theory.\" Since procrastination is itself irrational, Thaler seemed the perfect choice to help me get to the bottom of my quandary.\nFrom the onset, Thaler wasn't anything like what I was expecting from a Nobel laureate. Despite the seriousness of his work, I found Thaler fun and approachable. When I asked him about the Prize, he merely laughed and told me that he assumed the Nobel committee in Stockholm probably couldn't get hold of their first choice, so he got the call as a last minute stand-in. Despite his self-deprecatory nature, it didn't take more than a few minutes with Thaler to see his brilliant mind at work.\nBut back to taxes.\nDid you know that if you just inform the tax authorities that you'll be filing late, in most instances nothing will happen? But we choose instead to procrastinate, incurring penalties which could just as easily have been cleared up with a dose of candor and honesty!\nJoin my conversation with Richard Thaler where we cover everything from urinals, Richard's love affair with a sound button, and of course his take on why we procrastinate.\n",

        "content": "Newsweek's core mission is to provide our readers with a deep and nuanced understanding of the world around them. That means embracing a truly global perspective. We aim to transcend surface-level narratives, offering coverage that creates opportunities for true international dialogue.\nTo many, the 21st century is also known as the Asian Century. Asia will lead the world in this next phase of global economic growth. According to Goldman Sachs, by 2050, the world's GDP will be $227.9 trillion. Asia will represent the largest share of global GDP growth at $90.6 trillion, followed by the developed economies at $82.9 trillion and then the rest of the world.\nOur recent exclusive interviews with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, masterfully conducted by our team led by Global Editor-in-Chief Nancy Cooper, are the latest example of this commitment. In this context, I see our role at Newsweek as not merely passive observers but as active facilitators of meaningful dialogue around the future of Asia.\nAs an American who was born and lived the early part of my life in India, I have a nuanced perspective on India's challenges and aspirations. The country's relatively nascent sovereignty, having emerged only 75 years ago from centuries of colonial rule, is a testament to its resilience. The journey from its colonial past to a vibrant democracy is a narrative I hold close to my heart, and it drives my commitment to ensure that Newsweek covers India with the depth and nuance it deserves.\nCoverage of India by mainstream international media at times gravitates toward simplistic narratives that fail to capture the profound complexity and vibrant diversity of the world's most populous nation. Typically, the portrayal emphasizes either the booming IT and economic sectors or the persistent challenges such as poverty and social friction, leaving little room for the varied perspectives beyond and in between.\nSuch coverage can overlook the rich cultural tapestry, the internal innovations in various sectors, and the distinct political dynamics, all shaped by thousands of years of history, that today stand at the nexus of geopolitical change. The level of optimism and pride I'm seeing among Indians—friends, family, and colleagues—is truly inspiring and unlike anything I've experienced before. The global stage is set to witness a confident India, and if the Indian diaspora's contribution to the U.S., the UK, and elsewhere is a preview, the world stands to gain much from India's rising prominence.\nThat's why Newsweek's interview with Prime Minister Modi and the associated story was not just a recitation of current events: Our coverage delved into the complex dynamics of India's geopolitical relationships and their broader implications for global affairs.\nModi's remarks to Newsweek on the Indo-China border disputes and his call for urgent resolution resonated globally, sparking reactions from major geopolitical players, including a direct response from the Chinese government. The response was immediate and extensive, with major news outlets like Bloomberg and BBC amplifying the discussion. The reaction from China was particularly significant, and its Foreign Ministry spokesperson highlighted hopes for diplomatic progress. This international engagement underscores the relevance of Newsweek's efforts and reaffirms our role in fostering meaningful global dialogue.\nA few weeks after our interview with Prime Minister Modi, we met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo. There, too, we gained fresh insights into the thoughts of a significant national leader and his approach to his country's challenges and opportunities.\nThe interview explored the country's pressing need for stronger partnerships with the U.S. and other regional allies to address what he described as \"the most challenging and complex security environment since the end of World War II,\" a situation exacerbated by recent military activities by China and North Korea. Throughout the interview, he frequently emphasized the term \"peace,\" underscoring Japan's intent to be assertive yet remain a peace-loving nation, obeying international rules.\nIt's our view that building a successful digital media company with global relevance today involves understanding political, economic, and social dynamics and committing to comprehensive reporting that resonates at the global stage and captures the evolution of the global order. In that respect, our recent India and Japan coverage serves as a kind of blueprint for Newsweek's global future. The impact of our interviews with Prime Minister Modi and Prime Minister Kishida and the accompanying stories highlights the critical role of media in international relations and democracy, reinforcing our commitment to journalism that not only reports but also enlightens.\n",

        "content": "Today, news media faces a number of structural challenges: deepening polarization, diminishing trust and a stark decline in reader engagement.\nAt Newsweek, we've delved deeply into the forces driving us here. One way we're addressing these concerns is the Fairness Meter, which allows readers to hold us accountable by rating an article's fairness on a five-way scale. Our fairness meter can be found at the bottom of select articles across Newsweek's editorial content and will help maintain a high standard of integrity, transparency, and accountability.\nThe landscape of polarization and eroding trust\nMedia's increasing polarization owes much to the dominance of social media, but the challenges began even before that with the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987.\nThis policy, which mandated the inclusion of diverse viewpoints, once ensured a breadth of perspectives in broadcast journalism — a formal balance that lent fairness and credibility to the format. Its removal marked the first shift toward what we see today: more extreme and polarized media narratives. Gallup's polls from 2021 and 2022 show that only 34% of Americans trust mass media, with a pronounced partisan divide — 70% of Democrats versus a mere 14% of Republicans trust mass media outlets.\nThis erosion of trust in news media is not an isolated phenomenon. It's part of a broader moment in which public confidence in many institutions has been waning. In an age when misinformation can spread rapidly over social media, the role of responsible media in providing accurate and unbiased information has become more important than ever. We must do what we can to restore this trust, and it begins at the core of the news product.\nChanging dynamics of reader participation\nParallel to the issue of trust is the evolution of reader participation. The digital age has transformed how audiences interact with news content.\nPost-2016 trends indicate a decline in engagement with traditional news outlets, particularly among younger demographics. Young people increasingly bypass traditional news platforms, turning instead to social media feeds and other digital channels for their news and information.\nThis shift has significant implications for how news organizations engage with their audiences and maintain relevance in the digital era.\nThe Fairness Meter\nNewsweek's Fairness Meter is one of our responses. First, it represents a commitment to deepening trust and enhancing reader engagement by involving our audience in the direct evaluation of our content. Second, the tool redefines the more traditional comment-based systems, instead opting for a structured and consistent way for readers to express their views on the fairness of our articles, providing a concrete method for readers to help shape and sharpen our journalistic tenets.\nHere's some of what we've learned after placing the Fairness Meter on over 1,000 stories since it was activated in September 2023.\nThe aspirations of the Fairness Meter aim to go beyond just gauging perceptions of fairness. It's one step in the direction of restoring trust in the relationship between the public and the news media.\nRepatriating news engagement to the news property\nOver time, social media has usurped news organizations as the forum for discussion and debate of news and current events. One byproduct has been the formation of information echo chambers, which often come to confirm the existing biases of different groupings of users. Social platforms — with finely tuned algorithms designed to amplify engagement — frequently prioritize sensational and controversial content, perspectives and comments, fueling what could be referred to as \"enragement engagement.\"\nThis shift has effectively taken over much of the discourse that was once a feature of news platforms. The Fairness Meter is an initiative to bring back reader engagement to the news platform itself.\nThe end of the ivory tower: A call for public accountability\nThe modern media landscape needs a fundamental shift in how news outlets address reader perceptions and engagement. The era of the journalistic \"ivory tower\" — where media outlets operate in isolation from their audience — is over. Today's media must open itself up to public accountability. The Fairness Meter is one way of demonstrating this new approach, allowing readers to actively participate in shaping the stories our journalists report on.\nIgnoring the imperative for engagement and transparency comes with significant risks. The decline in public trust and reader engagement on news platforms is a clear signal. This growing distrust, exacerbated by digital echo chambers and social media-fueled confirmation biases, threatens the foundation of credible journalism.\nThe Fairness Meter is not merely a feedback tool; it fosters dialogue and understanding and demonstrates respect for our audience's intelligence, acknowledging their critical role in shaping the way that we in the media work.\nOriginally published on Poynter.org\n",

        "content": "In the annals of American broadcast journalism, the Fairness Doctrine stands as a testament to a time when balanced reporting was more than a noble pursuit; it was a mandated practice.\nThe policy, established by the Federal Communications Commission in 1949, obligated broadcasters to present contrasting viewpoints on contentious public issues.\nThis era of regulated balance came to an end in 1987 when President Ronald Reagan's FCC decided that the increasing diversity of media outlets meant the doctrine was no longer required. This pivotal shift laid the groundwork for significant transformations in the media landscape.\nIn the post-Fairness Doctrine era, we have witnessed an unprecedented polarization of American media. Freed from the obligation to present differing perspectives, many media outlets have defaulted to presenting narratives through a singular ideological lens.\nThe end of the Fairness Doctrine isn't the sole cause of media polarization, of course. The advent of social media and the algorithm-driven delivery of news, coupled with business incentives that prioritize engagement over balance, have exacerbated the divide. The outrage economy is a self-perpetuating system.\nThese shifts have profoundly affected our democratic society. Public discourse, once anchored in a commonly accepted set of facts, has fractured into micro-environments, subsets and cohorts, each espousing its unique version of reality. This accelerates the erosion of civil dialogue, undermining a critical component of our democracy. In this polarized media landscape, trust in the so-called fourth estate has plummeted to an all-time low.\nSocial media platforms, with their indiscriminate blending of content from trusted news outlets and dubious blogs, have furthered this erosion.\nThe shift towards subscription-based business models is a double-edged sword. While it has provided a lifeline to many media organizations in the face of shrinking advertising revenues, it has also inadvertently deepened the echo chambers. By prioritizing content that affirms their subscribers' worldviews, media outlets perpetuate these bubbles. And with quality journalism often locked behind paywalls, the information divide grows wider, further threatening the democratic ideal of an informed citizenry.\nIn the face of these challenges, it's crucial to remember that the principles of the Fairness Doctrine, though no longer legally enforced, needn't be abandoned. Instead, we should strive to voluntarily integrate these principles into our journalistic practices. By emphasizing fairness, balance and a representation of diverse viewpoints in our reporting, we can begin to counteract the rampant polarization that currently plagues our media and, by extension, our public discourse.\nNavigating today's media landscape is challenging. It's shaped by a web of social, technological and economic factors that defy easy solutions. Meanwhile, the erosion of civil dialogue, the declining trust in media, and the fragmentation of our public discourse pose serious threats to our democracy.\nWe need to raise our journalistic standards. Both-sides-ism isn't fairness — it's a failure of critical thinking or intellectual honesty. Let's not be naive: There are people and interests who deliberately skew our public discourse through misdirection, false equivalence and outright lies. We must counter those pernicious efforts by demanding a commitment to good-faith debate, which will pay dividends in rebuilding the trust that across the spectrum of ideas.\nAdopting a voluntary commitment to the principles embodied in the Fairness Doctrine represents a step in the right direction. It signals our dedication to upholding the ethical tenets of journalism, our respect for diverse viewpoints and our unwavering commitment to nourishing an informed and balanced public discourse.\nWhen fairness is no longer a doctrine, it must become a practice. Our democracy, in its present state, urgently requires this shift. For the media industry, it's not just a question of ethical responsibility but an existential imperative. The very health of our democratic society might depend on it.\nOriginally published on Poynter.org\n",
