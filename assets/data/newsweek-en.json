        "content": "The bad news for Gazprom is flowing as freely as the fuel it once pumped to Europe after it was ordered to pay €13bn ($14bn) for failing to fulfill natural gas orders, delivering the latest blow to Vladimir Putin's major revenue generator.\nThe Russian energy giant is one of the big business losers of Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It posted its first loss in a quarter of a century while facing a stalled pipeline to China as it struggles to find new markets for its products.\nOn Wednesday, German energy company Uniper announced it had terminated its long-term gas supply contracts with Gazprom Export, after an arbitration hearing in which Gazprom was accused of disrupting supplies following Putin's invasion.\nTwo days earlier, Gazprom's annual report had said its natural gas production had been cut from 412.94 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2022 to 359 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2023—a decline of 13 percent.\nIt means that last year's production is nearly a third less than its prewar production of 515 bcm in 2021, with Reuters reporting that this is the lowest since it was set up in 1989 toward the end of the Soviet Union.\nIn May, Gazprom Group, which includes oil and power businesses, posted a net loss of 629 billion rubles ($7 billion) for 2023, its first annual loss since 1999, according to Reuters, marking its fall from the world's largest publicly listed natural gas company.\nBefore the war, Gazprom provided around seven percent share of Russia's federal budget in 2021, but in 2023 it was estimated to be only about half that, dealing a blow to Putin's ability to fund the war and his long-term economic plans.\n\"Gazprom is in a very difficult position,\" said Henning Gloystein, director of energy, climate and resources at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. \"Europe gas sales used to be by far the biggest source of revenue for Gazprom.\"\n\"Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent pipeline supply cuts deprived Gazprom of those sales, and there's no quick and easy way to replace them,\" he told Newsweek.\nTom O'Donnell, a Berlin-based energy analyst, said the problems stem from a miscalculation by Putin who \"had been planning for years before the escalation of the war against Ukraine, to make Europe more dependent on Russian gas.\"\n\"This was effected through a partnership with Berlin who was very trusting of Putin,\" he told Newsweek. \"In the months before Putin launched the actual war, he cut off the gas to Europe. He tried to claim force majeure by making excuses like the compressors could not be repaired because of sanctions.\"\nBut faced with an unreliable trading partner, Europe found alternative long-term gas sources, with Norway overtaking Russia to become its top pipeline gas supplier. Sea- borne liquefied natural gas (LNG) increased from the United States and elsewhere.\nO'Donnell, a fellow at the Wilson Center, said Russia's European market could diminish further when its transit deal signed with Ukraine's Naftogaz in 2019 expires on January 1, 2025. \"Ukraine has been honoring that contract by passing on the gas to Europe, but they will not make another contract. It's clear politically that is beyond the pale for them.\"\nRussia is developing production of LNG, which is transported by ship so offers a route for otherwise stranded pipeline gas. But it probably lacks capacity to build enough ice-capable LNG carriers.\n\"Going into the LNG sector would be expensive and technically challenging,\" said Gloystein. \"Amid the current sanctions environment and a looming oversupply of global LNG, a major entry by Gazprom into this sector doesn't seem viable.\"\nRussia has two main LNG export terminals, Gazprom's Sakhalin-2, on the island in the Far East, and Novatek's Yamal LNG, on the Yamal Peninsula in the Russian Arctic. Gazprom and Novatek also operate medium-size facilities in the Baltic Sea.\nIn January, Novatek suspended some operations at Ust-Luga Baltic Sea fuel export terminal and processing complex, due to a fire started by a reported Ukrainian drone strike.\n\"There's other gas fields up in the Arctic that are planned to be connected to LNG but because of American sanctions, a lot of those projects are slowing down or might be canceled,\" said O'Donnell. \"There are Gazprom fields that are huge, but right now are locked in because all the pipes are mainly connected to Europe and are not being used,\" he added. \"It's not practical to try and connect those north to LNG fields.\"\nAfter much of the lucrative European market disappeared, the Kremlin had hoped the Power of Siberia 2, 2,700-mile pipeline would pipe 50 bcm a year between the Yamal Peninsula in the Arctic to northwest China, offsetting those losses.\nBut prices in the Asian nation are much lower than in Europe, and Beijing is reportedly trying to drive a hard bargain, while a deal over its construction has yet to be reached.\nThe Financial Times reported Beijing only wants a fraction of Siberia 2's planned annual capacity as well as prices close to Russia's subsidized domestic prices. Russia's lack of another overland route for its gas exports means Gazprom would probably have to accept these conditions, the paper said.\nVladimir Milov, former Russian deputy energy minister, told Newsweek that Russia cannot make any profits by exporting pipeline gas to China. Regarding expansion, \"exporting gas from eastern Siberian fields, which are much closer to China, is less expensive than to ship pipeline gas from Western Siberia, which will be even higher costs.\"\nIn 2024, the export price for the Chinese market is $257 per 1,000 cubic meters compared with $320.30 for the European and Turkish markets, according to Bloomberg.\n\"I think probably even $500 per 1,000 cubic meters would not be enough to make sure that Western Siberian exports to China are profitable,\" Milov said.\n\"China is not ready to give that kind of price, which means that effectively the Western Siberian gas is stranded now,\" said Milov. \"They are looking now for secondary markets like Pakistan or Mongolia, but China is clearly not ready to accept higher prices.\"\nThe Financial Times said it had seen a report commissioned by Gazprom leaders which concluded exports to Europe will average 50bn-75bn cubic meters per year by 2035, barely a third of prewar levels. However, it predicted Russia's LNG exports will more than double to 98.8-125.8 bcm in 2035 from 40.8 bcm in 2020 and comprise half total gas exports—increasing the power of Novatek, Russia's largest and most advanced LNG producer.\nGazprom will lose market share to Novatek or be forced to use its LNG infrastructure, according to the report. Western sanctions have cut Russia off from technology such as turbines that help move gas through pipelines and this could impact LNG expansion too.\nMeanwhile, Milov noted how Gazprom has also been trying to set up a \"gas hub\" scheme with Turkey which he describes as a \"gas laundering\" operation in which Russian gas is mixed with Azerbaijani or Iranian gas and resold to Europe via Turkey. But plans have been stalled due to wrangling between Moscow and Ankara over who would control the hub and trading schemes and how the EU might respond.\n\"If that hub ever begins to operate, which I doubt, a tracing mechanism will be introduced,\" he said, which means, \"it is almost certain that restoration of gas supplies to Europe is not going to happen.\" Newsweek contacted Gazprom for comment.\n",

Gavin Newsom to withdraw his backing for a \"limited-term extension\" to the facility, now the only operational nuclear power station in California. However PG&E has insisted the $12 billion figure is inaccurate and the maximum cost will be $8.3 billion.\nRead more: These Credit Cards Earn up to 5% Cash Back on Utilities\nIn September 2022 both chambers of the California Legislature approved a plan to extend Diablo Canyon's license to operate by five years, from an expiry date of 2025 to 2030, with a spokesperson for Newsom telling Newsweek closing the facility would put significant strain on the state's electricity network. However on June 13 the legislature voted to cancel a $400 million loan payment that had been intended to help finance Diablo Canyon's extension, amid concerns over the ballooning cost.\nDiablo Canyon nuclear facility, based in San Luis Obispo County, operates two nuclear units that produce \"18,000 gigawatt-hours of clean and reliable electricity annually\" according to its official website.\nOn May 8 the Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility, which opposes the extension for Diablo Canyon, wrote a letter to the California Public Utilities Commission claiming PG&E's estimate for the cost of extending Diablo Canyon's operation until 2030 had risen from $5.2 billion in May 2023 to $8.1 billion 10 months later, then $11.8 billion in March.\nIn the letter the alliance wrote: \"PG&E's Application seeks approval of the first installment of what it currently 'forecasts' to be an $11.8 billion extended operations period for Diablo Canyon. This is a material increase from the $8.1 billion cost forecast PG&E provided in its July 28 2023 rebuttal testimony...not to mention the recanted $5.2 billion cost estimate in its May 19, 2023 opening testimony.\"\nThe figure was repeated in an article published by the EWG on Thursday, which said: \"Now the public knows the actual price tag (at least what PG&E is currently admitting) is closer to $12 billion. And that figure excludes all of the enormously expensive safety improvements nuclear experts insist are needed for the two nuclear reactors.\"\nHowever, speaking to CBS News a PG&E spokesperson contested the $11.8 billion figure, which they said included costs unrelated to extending Diablo Canyon. Instead they claimed the cost of the extension is pegged at $8.3 billion and that \"the financial benefits exceed the costs.\"\nNewsweek contacted PG&E and Gov. Newsom's office for comment by telephone outside of usual office hours on Thursday. This article will be updated if either decides to comment.\nIn November 2022 Newsom said he supported what his office described as a \"limited-term extension of the Diablo Canyon Power Plant\" after a grant of $1.1 billion from the Department of Energy was announced.\nIn 2018 legislation came into effect requiring California to become completely reliant on clean energy sources, a category that includes nuclear, by 2045. To help achieve this the state has backed plans that would see the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles phased out by 2035.\n",

        "content": "Wisconsin Republicans reacted to former President Donald Trump reportedly calling Milwaukee \"a horrible city\" during a closed-door meeting on Thursday.\nTrump visited the U.S. Capitol for the first time since his supporters sieged the building on January 6, 2021, in a failed attempt to halt certification of President Joe Biden's victory. The ex-president met with GOP lawmakers as a precursor to the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee—set for July 15 to July 18—where Trump is expected to be chosen as the party's nominee.\nJake Sherman, founder of Punchbowl News who covers the Hill, reported on X, formerly Twitter, that Trump told House Republicans on Thursday, \"Milwaukee, where we are having our convention, is a horrible city.\"\nTrump spokesperson Steven Cheung responded to Sherman's reporting to X on Thursday, writing, \"Wrong. Total bull****. He never said it like how it's been falsely characterized as. He was talking about how terrible crime and voter fraud are.\"\nNewsweek reached out to Cheung via email for comment on Thursday.\nHouse Republicans from Wisconsin defended Trump but shared different interpretations of the former president's comment.\n\"Another classic example of s****y reporting by a Democratic Party shill pretending to be a journalist. Lies busy omission. @realDonaldTrump was specifically referring to the crime the CRIME RATE in Milwaukee,\" Representative Derrick Van Orden wrote on X.\nVan Orden included a photo of a Spectrum News article titled, \"Milwaukee ranks third for violent crimes nationwide,\" from May 2023.\nSherman shared an April article from Wisconsin Public Radio titled, \"Homicides in Milwaukee down nearly 50 percent compared to 2 years ago.\"\nSome said that Trump was referring to election integrity. After Trump lost to Biden in 2020, he claimed that the election was rigged against him. Biden won Wisconsin by a slim 0.7 percent margin, and there is no evidence to suggest there was election fraud in Wisconsin or any widespread fraud in 2020.\nRepresentative Scott Fitzgerald told Matt Smith, political director of WISN, a Milwaukee ABC affiliate, that Trump's comment was delivered after a question posed to him about election integrity: \"What he was talking about was the elections in Milwaukee. They're concerned about them.\"\nLawrence Andrea, Washington correspondent for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, said on X that Representative Glenn Grothman told him that Trump was \"concerned about the election in MKE\" and \"felt we need to do better in urban centers around the country.\"\nRepresentative Bryan Steil said on X: \"I was in the room. President Trump did not say this. There is no better place than Wisconsin in July.\"\nSteil told Smith, \"He wasn't talking about the city. He was talking about specific issues in the city,\" before the congressman listed issues such as crime and the public school system but would not say which issues Trump mentioned, according to the clip Smith shared on X.\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, a Democrat, told reporters on Thursday, \"Donald Trump wants to talk about things that he thinks are horrible, all of us lived through his presidency, so right back at ya, buddy.\"\nJohnson called Trump \"unhinged\" for making the comment and said he was \"wrong\" about Milwaukee.\nBiden seized the chance to score some points with Wisconsinites, posting to X on Thursday, \"I happen to love Milwaukee,\" to which Johnson replied, \"Milwaukee loves you back, President Joe Biden!\"\n",

The central bank also announced a suspension of trading in the Hong Kong dollar because it is pegged to the greenback.\nOfficially neutral on Vladimir Putin's invasion, China has greatly increased its trade with Russia, in 2023 reaching a record $240 billion while Putin has consistently touted a pivot away from the Western-dominated global financial system.\n\"The exchange rate of the yuan/ruble will set the trajectory for other currency pairs, will become a benchmark for market participants,\" the bank's statement added, noting last month that the share of the yuan in trading on the Moscow Exchange was 54 percent, making it the main currency in exchange trading.\nDollar-ruble trading volume on MOEX is around 1 billion rubles ($11 million) a day, euro-ruble trading hovers at around 300 million rubles ($3 million), much less than yuan-ruble daily volumes which regularly top 8 billion rubles ($90 million), CNN reported.\nEarlier, the Moscow Exchange had suspended trading in dollars and euros after the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) released details of its latest round of sanctions which included targeting Russian banks that act as intermediaries in dollar trading on the Russian foreign exchange market.\nIt means that banks, companies and investors cannot trade either currency via a central exchange and will instead have to rely on over-the-counter deals conducted directly between two parties.\nThe new sanctions will take full effect on August 13, although companies and individuals will still be able to buy and sell euros and dollars through lenders.

        "content": "I got addicted to heroin in college via an OxyContin habit. It was hitting the streets strong. No one really knew what it was. We just knew that it was a pill, and since it was produced by a pharmaceutical company, we assumed it wasn't too nefarious.\nVery quickly, your tolerance for OxyContin jumps and soon your habit reaches hundreds of dollars a day. We discovered heroin was very similar but much cheaper, so I started using that instead.\nEventually, I was kicked out of school and damaged my personal relationships with friends and family by stealing or asking to borrow money.\nMy family had extensive experience with drug addiction. My parents were both heroin addicts. When they discovered that I was too, they had no room for enablement.\nThey said: \"Come to us when you're really serious, but you're on your own now.\"\nI had nowhere to go, so I ended up homeless on and off for years, addicted to heroin and crack cocaine. I committed a lot of crimes to fund my addiction, mostly property crime and theft against drug stores and supermarkets.\nIronically, I never got arrested for any of that, or for using drugs in public places or breaking and entering, even though I was doing it all the time.\nI got into a fight at a Panda Express in Los Angeles. Another homeless person mugged me there and stole my cell phone. We fought and I took out a knife and asked for my phone back.\nThe police came, and that's why I finally ended up going to jail. They tried to charge me with assault with a deadly weapon, and that was going to probably get me a year-and-a-half prison sentence, which I didn't mind.\nBut I didn't want the violent felony on my record. So my public defender worked a deal out with the judge where I would just receive a six-month sentence in lieu of probation.\nMy charges got dropped, but I still requested a six-month violation in exchange for ending my probation after that term.\nI'd been to jail many times but never for more than three or four days, always in a holding cell. This was my first time going in \"blues,\" meaning I had to wear a blue jumpsuit.\nI went to a dorm filled with 100 men either awaiting trial for prison or who had been sentenced already, but the system was so clogged they were serving their time in the county jail.\nI was prepared for jail. I'd been around people who had been to prison and jail who told me: \"If you're white, you have to join a gang. There's no riding solo. It's not a big deal; you just have to do it.\"\nWhen I arrived, it was very scary. There are the Black gangs, the Hispanic gangs, and the white gangs. Some people in the white gangs have swastikas and are pretty serious.\nI knew that I had to join the Peckerwoods, a notorious white supremacist gang. But I am by birth half-Jewish. I have a Jewish last name too, so I was fearful.\nMy plan was to pretend I was German since my last name is Yiddish, so pretty similar sounding. It's probably not politically correct to say this, but I also don't look like a stereotypical Jewish person, at least in the eyes of neo-Nazis.\nI also think my image played into it. They saw a crackhead from Skid Row who weighed 130 pounds and just didn't connect that with a Jewish guy. So I got away with it. They believed I was just a German-American. They had no suspicion whatsoever.\nFor about three or four weeks, I played along. But I soon realized there was no need to. I never heard anything really racist or antisemitic.\nThere was another man named Lou. He was probably 50 years old, and every day, he would get a different meal than everyone else—a special meal in a blue box—and people lined up to buy it.\nI was curious. I looked in the garbage and saw there was Hebrew lettering on this blue box so I knew Lou was probably Jewish. I asked Lou if he was, and he said yes, that's why he gets the kosher meal.\nI said: \"I'm Jewish too, actually.\" He didn't really care. I said I had told the shot caller—a kind of gang leader—and all the guys that I was German when I came in, and now I'm thinking about getting the kosher meal.\nI asked what he thought the consequences would be of revealing that I was Jewish. He said: \"Oh, well, they're not going to care that you're Jewish, but they are going to care that you lied. So, I would just go talk to the shot caller privately and work this out.\"\nI expected a very violent repercussion for lying. There are violent repercussions for everything, from not washing your hands after using the bathroom to getting caught sharing food with another race.\nI talked to the shot caller. He was pretty angry that I lied, but at the same time, he said: \"Listen, I'm half Armenian. I'm not even fully white. We don't really care. These are just the rules and we have to follow them.\n\"As the shot caller, if it gets out that I'm not enforcing these rules, I'll get stabbed on the yard.\n\"You lied. You got to come clean to all the boys, and it's not a big deal. Just when you get the kosher meal, make sure that white guys get preference over buying it. If no one white wants to buy the meal, then you can sell it to the other races.\"\nOnce it came out that I was Jewish, I experienced zero antisemitic hate. It was more of a fascination. A lot of these people had never met a Jewish person. They pictured Jewish people as owning banks and companies and potentially even the jail.\nSo when they saw this Skid Row homeless addict who was Jewish, a lot of light bulbs went off about their preconceived ideas. Immediately, they asked: \"What are you doing here? Can't you make a phone call? Don't you know a lawyer?\"\nI said: \"No, I'm Jewish. My dad was a heroin addict carpenter. Not all Jews are what you think they are.\"\nIt opened up a lot of playful conversations with these people. They were fascinated with the concept that Jews were lawyers, so I started getting a lot of requests to consult people on their cases.\nI had to tell them: \"Listen, I'm a carpenter crackhead homeless guy. I'm not a lawyer.\"\nThey didn't care; they wanted to go over their cases with me. There was almost some soft antisemitism, but it mostly was playful and fanciful obsession and inquiry. They thought I had mystical powers.\nAfter a while, they realized I was just a normal guy like them.\nI suppose it's a similar situation to an investment banker ending up in a jail pod with a bunch of gangbangers. You'd think that would be a hindrance, but at the same time, it's such a unique experience.\nIt's like Sam Bankman-Fried right now in prison. You see these pictures of him with the other inmates, and it's like guys are obsessed with him because it's so uncanny that this famous former multibillionaire is in jail with them.\nThese people I was with had never really interacted with Jews. At least, never a Jew who was on their level. But they could see: I'm in here with you. I did some crazy crime just like you. I smoke meth just like you. I come from a broken home just like you.\nThey were fascinated with that. I talked to Lou about it, and he said that there used to be some problems for Jews, but in the end, the white gangs have such low numbers that they don't really care. They needed people.\nViolence is highly organized in the California prison system. I was in county jail, but it's just as bad as prison, if not worse.\nIf you get into an altercation with someone, you're not allowed to fight them. You have to go to your shot caller, and he has to go to his shot caller, and the shot callers must decide whether you're allowed to fight in a very controlled environment.\nI saw little violence between races. If someone from one race attacks a person from another race, it is a requirement that everyone joins in on that fight, and it turns into a race riot.\nNo one wanted a race riot because they result in the loss of privileges such as television or going to the yard. All these rules are set up to prevent a race riot.\nBut it did happen while I was in there.\nA Mexican gentleman was giving a face tattoo to a white guy, who made a comment saying he didn't think it was a very good job, and they got into a fight.\nIf a Mexican guy was in a fight with a white guy, it was a requirement that every white person and every Mexican joins that fight.\nI was hanging out with my Mexican friends at the time. We were making food, and the race riot kicked off. We all just kind of looked at each other, and one of them gave me a nod and hit me a few times lightly.\nIt turned into a big rumble, but you don't get that hurt because it's chaos in a small area. The guards came in, and it ended, and everything just went back to normal.\nThere were other occurrences of violence. When they punished someone for breaking a rule, my shot caller would get three guys to beat up the rule-breaker.\nBecause of my small stature, they would use me as an abatement—two big guys and one sort of smallish-medium guy. I was used a lot for that, and I didn't enjoy it.\nI had to fight people for breaking very stupid rules, such as sharing food with a Black person—a rule that I think is ridiculous. To be honest, my shot caller thought it was ridiculous too.\nHe told me personally that he shared food with Black people all the time; he just had to keep it secret.\nIt's Kafkaesque; there's some kind of bureaucratic overwatch going on and you don't even know if it exists or not, but you just have to follow these dumb rules.\nA shot caller is your gang leader in jail. This is not the leader of the entire gang but the leader in your pod, meaning your dorm.\nEvery gang has a shot caller, and then that jail has a head shot caller, and then the whole prison system has a single shot caller somewhere at the top that is this Wizard of Oz-type overlord who no one ever really sees but somehow enforces the rules.\nI had a pretty good relationship with the Mexican shot caller who had become very intrigued by an aspect of my Jewish experience in jail.\nI'm not a practicing Jew; I never was, and no one in my family really is. But when you get the kosher meal, they also give you a yarmulke for some reason.\nWhen the other inmates saw the yarmulke, they were mesmerized by this magical Jewish hat. The people who ran the world wore these hats, they thought, and now they were around one in a jail cell.\nThe Mexican shot caller would request to wear it when he gambled to bring him financial luck. This started sort of a buzz in the jail, and eventually, lots of people were requesting to wear it. Even neo-Nazis requested to wear it when they were gambling.\nI asked them to treat it with respect, not because I am religious, but I thought: \"My ancestors were religious. Don't be disrespectful.\"\nThe amount of respect they had for this yarmulke was actually disturbing; the fact that a Nazi with swastika tattoos would be so polite about a Jewish yarmulke.\nI have stayed in touch with some of the people in jail. Not all white people were Nazis. In fact, a small minority identified as neo-Nazis; most just identified as Peckerwoods. I've kept in touch with both.\nOne of the neo-Nazis has covered his swastika tattoo since getting out and turned his life around. I'm not saying I'm responsible for that, but I might have planted a seed or played a role in his thought process.\nI really enjoyed my time in jail and it was incredibly valuable for me, but it did not cure the mental obsession of addiction. It was not therapeutic in any way.\nI did kick heroin in jail for the last time. It was the worst withdrawal I've ever experienced, and I never wanted to do that again, but I did keep relapsing for very short bursts of time.\nFortunately, after some months outside, I wound up in a nonprofit long-term treatment center filled with a bunch of people that had been in and out of prison and jail. But this was a therapeutic community that was long-term.\nI was introduced to a community of recovery. I experienced some terrible health consequences in my period between getting out of jail and getting into this treatment center.\nBut in this long-term treatment center, I got to live for free for many months. Eventually, they helped me to get a job. They helped me to get tools and work clothes, and I got to enter a community of over 100 people who held me accountable.\nThat was the magic. That's what worked.\nI know a lot of people I was in rehab with just didn't have that. They felt hopeless; they were in their 30s or 40s and couldn't get a job other than in fast food. They just felt like they could never get ahead, and a lot of those people ended up relapsing.\nI did carpentry for a few years after I got sober, and then I eventually moved into other careers. I did visual effects for a few years, and then after the strike, I now work in property management.\nI credit labor and carpentry as a key factor in why I was able to get sober because it gave me hope. I immediately got a job that was decent paying, and I was doing something creative and constructive. It gave me a sense of purpose.\nI've written about all my experiences in my memoir, Crooked Smile. And the biggest life lesson I've learned from them is: The world doesn't owe me anything.\nI went through 29 years of life thinking that the world owed me something because my parents were heroin addicts, and I grew up in a very dysfunctional crack house with a lot of trauma.\nI thought because of that, I could have my cake and eat it too. I was allowed to get high unlike other people, and I deserved to commit crimes and be a menace to society because of the things I went through as a child.\nBut I realized all that gets you is sleeping on the cement or in a jail cell—if you're lucky. If you're not lucky, you end up dead.\nWhen that clicked, I saw that I've had a pretty amazing life, and the fact that I even come from a two-parent home is unbelievable. The fact that I grew up in America is unbelievable.\nI changed my thought process and realized: All my deficits are actually assets.\nThe fact that I went through all these horrible things and was homeless and on drugs could be turned into an asset when applying for a job or being a stand-up citizen.\nAll these experiences make me appreciate the smallest things in life. I'll never be unappreciative of having a pillow ever again. I went years without a pillow, and now when I have a bad day, I just think about my pillow.\nIt's that simple.\nJared Klickstein is the author of Crooked Smile: What It Took to Escape a Decade of Homelessness, Addiction, & Crime, which publishes on June 25, 2024.\nAll views expressed are the author's own.\nAs told to Shane Croucher.\nDo you have a unique experience or personal story to share?

        "content": "On Memorial Day, Americans rightly honor the more than 1 million warriors who've sacrificed their lives in the line of duty. We did the same on the recent 80th anniversary of the D-Day invasion by Allied troops in Normandy.\nBut our annual nod to past sacrifices means less and less if we're unwilling to honor what they fought for. American conflicts from the war for independence to World War II shared common traits—a desire on the part of Americans to fight, with a clear and limited purpose, and management of those conflicts by Americans or in close cooperation with American allies.\nDecades of mission creep have steered us away from those traits and into a dangerous place.\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was established after World War II as a strategic, defensive alliance to deter the Soviet Union's ambitions in Western Europe.\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO sought new purposes, evolving into an expeditionary force with interventions beyond its traditional area of operations, including the Balkans, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and now, indirectly, Ukraine. This shift has led to contentious debates about NATO's role and its impact on global stability, with some arguing that its expansion, especially toward Ukraine, has exacerbated tensions with Russia rather than ensuring peace.\nNATO's failure to evolve to meet the challenges of the current world has significant implications for American interests and global stability. CIA Director and once U.S. ambassador to Russia William Burns noted in 2008 that NATO's post-Cold War expansion would poke the Russian bear so to speak, stating, \"Ukrainian entry into NATO is the brightest of all redlines for the Russian elite (not just Putin) ... I have yet to find anyone who views Ukraine in NATO as anything other than a direct challenge to Russian interests.\"\nAnd NATO can't be solely blamed for Russia's aggression into Ukraine. The alliance's refusal to give Ukraine a hard \"no\" hasn't helped. Russia and Ukraine have sustained nearly 500,000 military casualties in the last two years, and there doesn't look to be an end in sight.\nThis cycle of engagement without clear objectives or successful outcomes has left deep scars, both on the affected regions and on America's credibility and resources.\nInvolvement in Ukraine risks escalating the conflict and drawing the alliance, specifically the U.S., deeper into a prolonged and deadly war. The financial and military aid the U.S. provides—we provided more to Ukraine in the last funding bill than the annual cost of the U.S. Marine Corps—strains American resources, and the presence of U.S. advisors increases the risk of American casualties.\nWe inch closer and closer to escalation with a nuclear power in a war that isn't even ours.\nAs a Green Beret who has led men into combat, I've seen the brutal costs of war firsthand. I've watched peers blown up in their prime, families destroyed, and futures lost to alcohol and suicide. These are not just numbers; they are lives shattered, and lives that can't even point to a foreign policy success the way the World War II generation could.\nTo combat veterans, the problem is clear. America's military conflicts today lack the traits that so often characterized our earlier campaigns. Today's wars are hive-mind affairs led by global coalitions. Their purpose is unclear, and often there is no discernable goal. Most Americans are either barely invested against these fights, or are confused about what to think about them.\nThere is a persistent refusal to engage with the world as it really is in favor of chasing idealistic hopes of democracy. This misguided pursuit often leads to disaster, leaving Americans to pay the cost.\nEurope reaps the benefits of America standing guard at their doorstep and continues asking for more. Former British Prime Minister David Cameron stated U.S. support for Ukraine is the \"keystone in the arch\" of the fight for democracy, while urging further assistance for Ukraine to not just \"hold the line\" but to \"go on the offensive\" in 2025. When former President Donald Trump asked everyone in the alliance to pay their fair share, the elites lost their collective minds, clutching their pearls at summits, terrified of losing the respect of European partners.\nNATO will celebrate its 75th anniversary this year, and no doubt there are many talking about what the next 75 years should look like. As a combat veteran with more than 20 years' experience, I can tell you—the future of NATO is America playing a realistic, fair part in the alliance. That part should not be characterized by a windfall of American taxpayer dollars, not to mention the potential cost in lives if war between Ukraine and Russia escalates into Western Europe.\nAmericans have stood with Europeans to storm the beaches and end tyranny before. But those moments were predicated on shared interests and mutual sacrifices.\nTo truly honor the military heroes of our past, we would do well to remember the clear-eyed purpose for which they fought. We need leaders who respect these American values and are committed to steering NATO back to its original mission of true defense and stability, rather than allowing it to drift into endless conflicts.\nJason Beardsley is director of veterans' initiatives at Stand Together and senior advisor to Concerned Veterans for America.

As I walked along the beaches, the fast-moving tide of the Bay of the Seine washing over my feet, I felt the enduring bond of the Allies—a bond that continues to shape our present and future. It reminded me of the courage and resolve of soldiers from 13 nations who stormed those beaches 80 years ago, under a sky filled with uncertainty but fueled by a singular purpose: to reclaim freedom from tyranny.\nFive years later, NATO emerged from the ashes of that conflict, a testament to the collective resolve to prevent future wars and uphold democratic values. Today, NATO represents a shared vision of peace and democracy that binds its members together, a vision as vital now as it was when the alliance was formed over seven decades ago.\nArticle 5 of NATO's Washington Treaty, which asserts that an attack on one member is an attack on all, has served as a powerful deterrent against aggression. During the Cold War, NATO contained Soviet expansion, preventing another war in Europe. Now, with Russia's resurgence and China's growing influence, NATO's role in maintaining peace and stability is more crucial now than it's ever been.\nOver the past 75 years, NATO has evolved to address a wide range of security challenges. From combating terrorism and cyber threats to managing regional conflicts, NATO's adaptability and commitment to crisis management and conflict prevention have ensured that regional instabilities do not escalate into broader conflicts. NATO's interventions in the Balkans, its role in Afghanistan post-9/11, and its efforts against piracy off the Horn of Africa are examples of its enduring relevance.\nReflecting to 1949, we see a Europe still recovering from the ruins of war, with the specter of tyranny looming large. United by a vision of peace, nations came together to form NATO to ensure that the horrors of the past were never repeated. Beyond collective defense, this alliance promoted political stability and democratic governance—vital ingredients for global peace and security.\nAs the Cold War thawed, Eastern European countries, once under authoritarian regimes, began to see new opportunities. With NATO's support, these nations embarked on a journey of democratic reforms and economic progress. NATO, standing firm on its principles, helped these countries transform, reinforcing democratic governance as the bedrock of global stability.\nCertainly, NATO faces challenges, including disparities in defense spending and rising nationalism within its ranks. Yet, it remains the most successful alliance in the history of the free world.\nRussia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has ignited the bloodiest conflict in Europe since World War II, reinforcing NATO's vital role in deterring aggression and maintaining peace. This invasion and the searing images we see from that war are glaring reminders of the ongoing need for a strong, unified NATO to confront emerging challenges and protect national sovereignty.\nLast week, walking along Omaha Beach with the runnels in the sand tracing their ancient patterns, I reflected on the brave men who stormed ashore under withering enemy fire. The current threats we face across the Atlantic and beyond make it clear: There is a direct thread from Omaha Beach to Brussels.\nIn those quiet moments, I realized that only by strengthening these bonds can we truly honor the memory of those who gave their last full measure of devotion on the beaches of Normandy. We owe it to them to carry their legacy forward with the same resolve and dedication, in our own lives, and in the alliance that has prevented another world war from occurring.\nColonel John Fenzel is a retired Army special forces officer, and the CEO of The World War II Foundation.\nThe views expressed in this article are the writer's own.\n",

The district was announced in February in response to Finland joining the NATO alliance.\n\"As part of the second stage of the exercises of nonstrategic nuclear forces, personnel of the missile formation of the Leningrad Military District are practicing combat training tasks of obtaining special training ammunition for the Iskander-M operational-tactical missile system, equipping launch vehicles with them and covertly advancing to the designated position area for training for missile launches,\" the ministry announced.\nIt also said the Russian navy would be involved, and that crew members will be equipping \"sea-based cruise missiles with training special warheads\" and entering designated patrol areas.\nNewsweek has approached NATO for comment.\nAfter Putin in February signed new military decrees formally reestablishing the Moscow and Leningrad Military Districts, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a U.S.-based think tank, assessed that the move indicated he is preparing for a potential large-scale war with NATO in the future.\nThe ISW assessed at the time that the re-creation of the Moscow Military District and Leningrad Military District \"supports the parallel objectives of consolidating control over Russian operations in Ukraine in the short-to-medium term and preparing for a potential future large-scale conventional war against NATO in the long term.\"\nThe Leningrad Military District is a key component of the Russian armed forces that oversees parts of the nation's defense strategy in Russia's western region. The district's involvement in Russia's nuclear drills comes amid rising tensions between Russia and the West over Putin's ongoing war in neighboring Ukraine.\nRussia has warned that actions by the West could force it to amend its nuclear doctrine, which lays out the conditions under which it can use such weapons.\nOn June 7, Putin said at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum that his country's nuclear doctrine is \"a living instrument\" that can be changed.\nRussia is \"carefully watching what is happening in the world around us and do not exclude making some changes to this doctrine,\" Putin said.\nDo you have a tip on a world news story that Newsweek should be covering?

Four countries—Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Belgium—have committed to providing F-16 aircraft to Ukraine to boost its depleted fleet of Soviet-era planes, up against superior and more numerous Russian aircraft.\n\"Ukrainian forces may be attempting to degrade Russian air defenses ahead of anticipated F-16 fighter jet deliveries to Ukraine,\" the ISW evaluated. If Kyiv succeeds, it might be able to more effectively use the Lockheed Martin-made jets, the think tank added.\nNewsweek has reached out to the Ukrainian military for comment via email.\nKyiv had long requested the F-16s, although when exactly the aircraft would arrive and be operational has never been clear. They are expected in the next few weeks, although delays and vagueness have plagued the timetables laid out by donating countries.\nUkrainian pilots have been undergoing training in several NATO nations while Kyiv puts in place the necessary infrastructure to operate the aircraft.\nOnce the jets arrive, they will be an \"absolute magnet for Russian air defenses and Russian aircraft,\" Frank Ledwidge, senior lecturer in Law and War Studies at Portsmouth University in the U.K. and a former British military intelligence officer, previously told Newsweek.\nUkraine has carried out a string of attacks on Russia's expensive air defense assets that would pose a danger to its prized F-16 fleet once the aircraft are airborne.\nOn Wednesday, Ukraine's military said its forces had destroyed S-300 and S-400 air defense radar systems in an overnight strike on Crimea.\nThe systems were stationed near one of Russia's military airfields close to the Crimean port city of Sevastopol, where Ukraine has repeatedly struck Russia's Black Sea naval fleet, Kyiv said. Russian military bloggers and Ukrainian sources reported that ATACMS were used.\nEarlier this week, Ukraine said it had \"successfully attacked\" one Russian S-400 anti-aircraft missile system near Dzhankoy—a key road and rail hub for Russia in northern Crimea—and two S-300 systems near Chornomorske and Yevpatoria, in the west of the peninsula. Russian military bloggers suggested ATACMS were responsible for the strikes.\nReports also indicated Kyiv destroyed part of an S-300 or S-400 air defense battery over the border in Russia's Belgorod region in early June. The loss of air defense capabilities in Belgorod, which looks onto Ukraine's northeastern Kharkiv region, reportedly led Russia to transfer air defenses from Crimea in recent weeks, the ISW think tank noted.\nSeparately, Ukraine said it had damaged two of Russia's advanced Su-57 stealth fighter jets hundreds of miles into Russian territory earlier this month.\nS-300 and S-400 air defense systems, plus Su-57 jets, \"are significant Russian air defense and aviation assets that deny Ukraine the ability to fly aircraft near the front and support Russian offensive operations in Ukraine,\" the ISW said on Wednesday.\nA senior Ukrainian aviation commander said earlier this week that Kyiv will store some of its Western-donated F-16 fighter jet fleet in \"secure air bases\" outside of the country to avoid Russian strikes on the advanced aircraft.\nExperts previously suggested to Newsweek that the number of F-16s Ukraine will operate is too small to make a strategic difference across the entire front line, and Russia has likely made use of the months since the donations of the jets were revealed to prepare.\n",

Ukraine has frequently attacked Russian military bases, saying they are legitimate targets in the ongoing war.\nIn the Voronezh region, an unused tank at an oil depot was damaged by falling drone debris, Alexander Gusev, the region's governor, said on Telegram.\n\"There was no fire, there were no casualties or other destruction of infrastructure,\" he added.\nRussia also launched an attack on Ukraine overnight, deploying 14 missiles and 17 kamikaze drones, according to Mykola Oleshchuk, the commander of Ukraine's air force, who posted about the attack on Telegram. He said Ukraine shot down seven cruise missiles and 17 kamikaze drones.\nDo you have a tip on a world news story that Newsweek should be covering? Do you have a question about the Russia-Ukraine war?

        "content": "Barbra Streisand's message about Israeli hostages held captive by Hamas in Gaza has deeply divided people.\nThe Jewish singer spoke out as she shared a New York Times article from March about a former hostage who said she was sexually assaulted while in captivity.\n\"It goes without saying that hostages are suffering and must be released now. There is an additional horror for female hostages. What they endure in terms of sexual violence should be – as the UN said, 'clear and convincing' to all. It should also be unequivocally denounced,\" she wrote on X, formerly Twitter, in a post that has been viewed almost 500,000 in 24 hours.\nPalestinian militant group Hamas kidnapped around 250 people from Israel in a surprise attack there on October 7, when its fighters also killed 1,200 people. Israel's subsequent military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 37,100, according to the latest figures from Associated Press.\nA United Nations report from March based on research gathered in January found Hamas had committed sexual violence against some female hostages, based their firsthand accounts, as well as against women during its October 7 attack.\nAnother U.N. report released on Wednesday described ongoing sexual violence committed by Israeli forces in Gaza and the West Bank, which it said amounted to \"war crimes.\" The Human Rights Council report claimed \"specific forms of sexual and gender-based violence constitute part of Israeli Security Forces' operating procedure.\"\nIt also found members of Palestinian armed groups committed sexual violence against Israelis.\nResponses to Streisand's post were mixed. Some people accused her for not speaking up sooner in favor of Israel and its hostages, while others tried discredit her claims.\n\"Nice to see a legend in the music industry speak up while too many are silent.\nThank you Barbara,\" replied @JudeanGeneral.\nBut @nickberoxbe1989 added: \"What took you so long? Are you afraid of upsetting your friends and fans?\"\nAnd @bonsaisky wrote: \"She's repeating the same debunked lies 😂\"\nStreisand has long been vocal in her support of Israel and described herself, in a 1987 interview with Esquire magazine, as \"a Jewess through and through, although I'm not religious.\"\nShe attended a rally at the Hollywood Bowl in 1967 which was put on to raise emergency funds for Israel after the Six-Day War.\nThe singer was good friends with late Israeli politician Shimon Peres and has made numerous statements since the October 7 attack.\nShe wrote on Instagram in December: \"When I first met Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres years ago, I asked him 'How can you help the Palestinians?' He replied 'By making their lives better!' We needed his advice then, and should urgently heed it now. In my humble opinion, we need a two-state solution that will hopefully bring peace and prosperity to the region.\"\nDays after the Hamas attack she took to Instagram, where she wrote: \"The population of Israel is under 10 million people. There are over 700 confirmed Israeli dead from the terrorist attack on civilians. The equivalent in the US would be over 25,000 dead in New York City on 9/11.\"\nShe also appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert the following day, where the eponymous host asked her about the conflict.\n\"People are people,\" Streisand said. \"It's true. We all want the same thing. We all want love in our hearts. We all want family. We all want to feel secure. I hope for the best because this is heartbreaking what's happening now with these people, the children, the mothers—doesn't matter what religion they are. This is beyond religion. This is insanity for us not to learn how to live together in peace.\"\n\"I could easily cry about this,\" she continued. \"Where is God in this time? Where is he or she?\"\n",

Newsweek emailed X and a spokesperson for Trump for comment Thursday.\nTrump's post was flooded with replies from people sharing their dissatisfaction with the update.\n\"He is hiding that he can possibly like a porn tweet, a racist tweet, or whatever it is that he doesn't want everyone to see. My take, he only has access to it and he will in the future use it against anyone who goes after and against him,\" one person theorized.\n\"I'm sure he's doing it for his vanity, just like Trump. Elon couldn't stand criticism on Twitter, so he bought it to control it. Now, I'm betting he couldn't stand people pointing out the various disgusting and conspiratorial posts he likes, so he got rid of it,\" said another.\n\"What if everybody were to post \"like [heart emoji]\" in every single post they like? I'm sure that wouldn't mess up everyone's feed! [laugh crying emoji],\" someone else wrote.\nA fourth person added: \"I wish we could sue him for this platform he destroyed.\"\nNot everyone is unhappy, as some people have taken to Musk's post about the news to tell him that they welcome the update.\n\"Great new feature Elon. Will definitely help users feel more comfortable liking posts that they agree with,\" responded the controversial English internet personality Oli London.\n\"Good move. It's a step toward providing people with more privacy. If people want to share what they like, they can repost the content,\" wrote social media personality Ed Krassenstein.\n\"It's sad that people will get attacked for liking something,\" another person added.\nThis news comes after X updated its policy to allow what it calls \"consensually produced and distributed\" adult content on the platform, a move that has sparked criticism on social media that it will damage the user experience.\n\"We believe that users should be able to create, distribute, and consume material related to sexual themes as long as it is consensually produced and distributed. Sexual expression, visual or written, can be a legitimate form of artistic expression,\" X's page on \"adult content\" policies reads.\n\"We believe in the autonomy of adults to engage with and create content that reflects their own beliefs, desires, and experiences, including those related to sexuality. We balance this freedom by restricting exposure to Adult Content for children or adult users who choose not to see it.\"\nThe platform noted that it will restrict such content behind a warning before users can access it. It would require that those who post on the platform change their settings to allow for such warnings.\n\"If you regularly post adult content on X, we ask that you please adjust your media settings,\" it said about the policy last month. \"Doing so places all your images and videos behind a content warning that needs to be acknowledged before your media can be viewed. You can also add a one-time content warning on individual posts. If you continue to fail marking your posts, we will adjust your account settings for you.\"\nThe policy suggested that underage users will not be able to access the content.\n\"Users under 18 or viewers who do not include a birth date on their profile cannot click to view marked content,\" it said.\n",

        "content": "One of Gwyneth Paltrow's co-stars in the 1996 movie Emma has accused the actor of pulling a \"heartbreaking\" move by unwittingly cutting their screen time in half after complaining about a line in the script.\nPaltrow starred in the acclaimed period comedy as Emma Woodhouse, whose attempts at matchmaking her friends cause chaos in her own love life. Based on the 1815 Jane Austen novel of the same name, the movie's star-studded cast included Toni Collette, Alan Cumming, Jeremy Northam and Ewan McGregor.\nWelsh actress Ruth Jones was in the early stages of her career when she landed the small role of \"Bates' Maid\" in the film. However, she has now stated that her experience on the set left a lot to be desired.\nSpeaking of the latest episode of Wondery's Brydon & podcast, which is hosted by her longtime friend and Gavin & Stacey co-star Rob Brydon, Jones looked back over her career before sharing a less-than-favorable recollection of her time in Paltrow's presence.\nNewsweek reached out to a representative of Paltrow via email for comment.\n\"It was the first film I'd done. I had two lines [in the script],\" Jones said. \"I had to announce Gwyneth Paltrow and say, 'Miss Woodhouse is here,' and then I had to say, 'Goodbye, Miss Woodhouse' at the exit and let her out. And Gwyneth Paltrow cut one of my lines.\"\nJones said of Paltrow: \"She said, 'Does she really need to say that. I mean, can I just come in?' Now, imagine this for people who are starting out. You've got two lines, and someone cut 50 percent of your script. It's heartbreaking.\n\"I was very fortunate because Sophie Thompson [who played Miss Bates] was in that scene as well...and she was lovely and it was really nice. But with Gwyneth, no, she wanted to cut my lines.\n\"When I had to do the scene letting her out of the house, you can imagine the camera is on the other side of the door, in this beautiful little Dorset village, lovely little thatched cottage,\" Jones went on. \"We were waiting for them to shout 'action,' so it was just me and Gwyneth behind the door. She didn't want to talk to me. I mean, I was a nothing. I had one line, then I was down to one.\n\"So, I tried to make conversation with her. At the time she was going out with Brad Pitt, and I said, 'Do you have any Welsh connections? Because Gwyneth, I always think of as a Welsh name. Where did the name come from? How come you're called Gwyneth?' She said, 'My mother had a friend called Gwyneth, and she really liked the name, so she called me Gwyneth.'\"\n\"She was quite dismissive of me. So I was thinking, 'Yeah, well it's an old woman's name where I come from, love, and when you marry Brad Pitt, you're going to be Gwyn Pitt.'\"\nDespite her recollection of their interaction, BAFTA winner Jones, who is currently starring in a London stage production of the musical Sister Act, later conceded that expressing the need to cut others' lines is a \"tricky\" task.\n\"I would never say it in front of the actor. I would never embarrass them like that,\" she told Brydon. \"You have to do things that are right for the show, don't you? You're not doing it just to be mean. But it is a very tricky one, that.\"\n",

        "content": "It was the early 1980s and I'd been Habitat for Humanity's executive director for a year or so of this nascent New York City project. I was only around 25 at the time.\nWe laid claim to this building on East 6th Street but didn't have ownership. The Lower East Side was like the South Bronx at that time—pretty bombed out, with frequent fires destroying buildings. It started to become gentrified, but nothing like it is today.\nHabitat International in Georgia was not very well known back then, with only several dozen projects around the world, many of them in Africa and elsewhere in the Americas.\nBut former president Jimmy Carter, two years out of office, had become interested in Habitat.\nOne day, I happened to pick up the New York Daily News, which I never read. There was a small article saying Carter would be in New York to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the installation of the Greek Archbishop, a friend of Carter's, on April 1, 1984.\nI sent the clip to Millard Fuller, the founder of Habitat who had recently gotten Carter interested in the organization, thinking it'd be great if the former president could stop by our project while he was in New York, but never believing it would be possible.\nMillard woke me up at about 7:00 in the morning with a call. He said: \"Rob, I got news for you. Jimmy Carter's coming to your project.\"\nWell, that got me up. We made plans for Carter to come, and my instructions were to meet him on Sunday morning in the presidential suite of the Waldorf Astoria on Park Avenue.\nI had never met anyone of that stature before. I was so nervous waiting outside the suite that it felt like someone had stuck a vacuum cleaner hose into my mouth and sucked out all the moisture. Then he showed up.\nOne of the first things I noticed was how old he looked compared to when he left office. It happens to everybody; the only president who looked younger at the end of his time in the White House was Ronald Reagan.\nI said, \"Hello, Mr. President,\" thanked him for coming, and then I pulled out these cheesecakes from a famous deli in Brooklyn called Junior's.\nI said: \"Mr. President, if you don't come back to New York for any other reason, you have to come back for Junior's cheesecakes.\"\nI pulled out the first one and said: \"This one's for you and...Mrs. President.\" I didn't even know what to call her. And then I said: \"And this one's for Nancy Konigsmark.\"\nNancy had been married to Hamilton Jordan, a staffer in the White House, and she was Carter's appointment secretary. I had been dealing with her about the logistics of the meeting.\nThen I said: \"And this one's for these fellows for taking such good care of you,\" and pointed to the burly Secret Service agents accompanying him.\nCharacteristically, Carter was very gracious and said: \"Well, thank you, Rob. Thank you very much. That's very nice.\" But I could tell he thought: \"Am I in New York City? This is the hokiest thing I've ever experienced in my life.\"\nWe got in the car. He'd had a dispute with Ed Koch, the mayor of New York, over Israeli policy. On the way down, he said: \"What's the status of the purchase of the building from the city?\"\nI told him we were still working through that, and he said: \"I'll call the mayor and ask him to increase the price for you and then he'll give it to you.\" This showed he had a marvelous sense of humor. He wasn't known for that, but he had quite a dry wit.\nWe got down to the Lower East Side, East 6th Street near Avenue D. The Secret Service were going nuts because it was the 9th precinct which at the time had the highest homicide rate in the city, mostly because of drugs. The Lower East Side is nothing like it is now.\nToday, my wife and I attend a church in Manhattan and we run into 20 and 30-somethings who come from Kansas City and places like that. They say: \"I like New York, but I was hoping to live on the Lower East Side. I can't afford it. I'm gonna have to live on the Upper East Side.\"\nIn the 80s, when I lived on the Lower East Side, there were three different brands of heroin being sold on my block. It just shows how much New York has changed. (What hasn't changed is the shortage of affordable housing, more acute than ever).\nBefore we started work on the building, the junkies had taken the marble slabs out of the staircase. The day before Carter's arrival, we got volunteers to put together a temporary wooden staircase, but we still had to navigate our way up to the roof, which was full of holes.\nFrom the top, Carter looked downtown and saw the World Trade Center and Wall Street and all that it represented. Then he looked in the other direction, saw Midtown Manhattan and all the wealth and power that it represented.\nFinally, peering over the edge to the rubble-strewn backyard of the building, the former president saw an elderly woman cooking her breakfast over an open fire.\nThat view of the woman stuck with him. He wrote about it subsequently in at least one book, contrasting the image with the fact that he was in the richest city in the richest country on Earth.\nWhen we got out to his car, Carter said to me: \"Rob, Millard Fuller is my boss. If there's anything I can do to help you here, let him know.\"\nI blurted out: \"Well, maybe you can send up some volunteer carpenters from your church.\"\nHe said, \"I'll think about it,\" and the next day he called Millard Fuller and said he was not only going to send some carpenters, he was going to be one of the carpenters. That changed everything.\nThat was April of 1984 and they made plans to come up in September. They chartered a Trailways bus out of Atlanta, driving overnight to the church I was attending at the time, Metro Baptist on West 40th Street, near the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Hell's Kitchen.\nThey stayed on bunk beds in the church—including Carter—and then took a bus down to the Lower East Side each day, about a 20-minute ride. He worked throughout that week, but his first day of work was actually Labor Day in 1984.\nLabor Day used to be the official kickoff to the presidential race. Both Reagan and Walter Mondale were marching in Labor Day parades, and Mondale was in New York. Meantime, the former president was on the Lower East Side working in a rubble-strewn building.\nThe AP did a story prior to their coming and the interest exploded. Nowadays, you have sitting presidents working on Habitat projects. Habitat is a major charity today, but back then it was not well known.\nThe notion that a former leader of the free world would spend an entire week working eight to ten-hour days in a hot building in one of the roughest neighborhoods in New York City was just unfathomable.\nThe morning shows all broadcast from the Lower East Side. Carter did a press conference that Monday on the steps of the building, but he couldn't wait to get back to work.\nHe recognized what his presence would mean for the organization so he was willing to do a few interviews. But his real interest was in the work on the building. He had to be pulled away from the job, being the first to work and the last to lay off.\nIn subsequent years, I've heard he was surprised that a good deal of his image came from the Habitat experience. Maybe he was frustrated because the Carter Center was involved throughout the world in many things, from eradicating river blindness caused by Guinea worm in Africa to monitoring elections.\nBut he was most famously known for his Habitat work because it's so visual and dramatic.\nHabitat had never done anything like this before, having mostly worked on single-family homes. A 19-unit building in the most visible city in the world was something new, but it instantly put the organization on the global map.\nIt was also a major fundraising challenge. They were building houses for $30,000, but this thing ultimately cost over a million dollars. That didn't happen overnight, and things were slow, so Carter came back the following summer for a week.\nCarter was a runner, and one day, we actually jogged together from the Metro Baptist building down to the project site, about four miles, which was cool.\nAnother day, the whole group took the subway and walked through Times Square, then got on the subway and went down to the Lower East Side.\nOn the subway car, two older women saw him, asked me if that was who they thought it was and said no one in their family was going to believe they had shared a ride with the former President of the United States.\nThere was a good deal of buzz and it was a heady experience for me as a young man.\nI didn't have any long fireside chats with the former president. Our interactions tended to be more observational and informational than conversational, but he was serious about the work itself.\nThe second year, it was more finished work rather than gut rehab. This project, started in '84, stretched into '86. Early '86, I saw him at a board meeting. A good deal of his and Habitat's reputation was resting on this.\nWhen he asked about the project's progress, I said: \"We're gonna get a certificate of occupancy by June.\" He said, \"1986?\" It was humor with a barb, but we finally got it done and people moved in.\nA couple of years later, when he was in Charlotte, I went down to the project while he was there. Carter was sitting under a tree taking a break.\nTruth be known, I was a pretty good communicator but not a sterling administrator, and in my mid-20s I hardly knew how to run a project like that. I suspect our nascent board tapped me for the position because I was the only one available— AKA, unemployed. But finally, we got a board that recognized it was time for me to go.\nSo when I joined Carter in Charlotte I was on the cusp of leaving Habitat, looking to get into journalism or public relations. I asked him if he would write a letter of recommendation. He said no, but that I could give people his name and if anyone called, he would tell them what he knew about me.\nThat project, more symbolic than anything else, helped launch the visibility of Habitat. It wasn't going to address the critical housing need of East 6th Street, let alone New York City, but it served its purpose.\nJimmy Carter is often called the best former president we've ever had. He's a man who has lived his faith until the end. The contrast he offers to today's Christian nationalism and culture wars is stark.\nI was a fan of him as president, and I think, like everyone in that exalted position, he couldn't control everything. He didn't control the Iranian hostage crisis, or the staggering combination of inflation and unemployment, all that contributed to his being a one-term president.\nBut of this there is no doubt: He truly cared about the United States and the poor around the world, evident in the Carter Center's work in Africa and elsewhere.\nNo politician can suffer from a diminished self-concept and still be in the game, but what I've always admired about Carter is his humility.\nOn the first day of his work on our project, a foreign journalist asked how it felt to be \"a former vice president.\" Carter smiled and said that having never been a vice president, he couldn't say. Then, softly, \"it shows how fleeting fame is.\"\nNot long after, he told us about being in Japan and making a speech, leading with a joke. By his admission joke-telling was not his forte, but his led to an extended and surprising round of uproarious laughter.\nCarter later asked the translator what he said. Sheepishly, the translator admitted he just told the audience: \"President Carter just told a joke. Everyone laugh.\"\nHow many politicians can tell stories like that on themselves?

        "content": "The summer before my first year of high school, I took daily two-mile runs down the country road I lived on in western Massachusetts. I was training for my third season on the varsity soccer team and enjoyed pushing my body, sprinting from one telephone pole to the next, then slowing to a jog, then sprinting again.\nBut one morning when I went for my run, something was different—I'd barely made it past the first telephone pole when my body begged me to stop. Running felt impossible and even walking was difficult, so I turned around, went home, and sank into the couch, where I stayed for much of the next year.\nAlthough I didn't know it then, I'd developed Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, or POTS, a mysterious and often misdiagnosed disease that's part chronic fatigue syndrome, part fibromyalgia, and part dysautonomia—dysfunction of the nervous system that causes changes to blood pressure, heartbeat, and other essential body processes.\nI've been POTS-free for 10 years now, but as the disease sees a resurgence in the wake of COVID-19 (studies show that almost 80 percent of Long Covid patients have POTS and POTS-like symptoms are common among those who experienced severe COVID-19), I'm reminded of my own experience with the condition, and hope it passes for other patients as it did for me.\nFatigue was the first symptom I noticed that summer, but soon there were others. My body became ultra-sensitive to pain—even a gentle hug from my parents felt like it was bruising my skin, and the prick of a needle to draw blood (something I was used to since I have cystic fibrosis, a genetic respiratory disease that requires regular blood tests) was suddenly excruciating.\nI experienced numbness and tingling all over my body, I could feel every heartbeat echo loudly in my chest, and my feet turned a frightening shade of purple when I sat with them on the floor rather than propped up on a cushion.\nThere seemed to be no obvious root cause of my symptoms, which had doctors stumped.\nMy primary care physician prescribed the ADHD medication Concerta for chronic fatigue, which kept me awake for 24 hours straight. A specialist tested me for Lupus, my cystic fibrosis doctors thought my disease worsening and encouraged me to increase my treatments. Acupuncturists and energy healers tried in vain to ease my symptoms, putting me through the intense pain of needles and massage.\nSome doctors, after seeing that my test results were normal, even suggested ibuprofen and told me to push through it.\nWithout answers, I began to wonder if I was making it all up.\nPerhaps even worse than the physical symptoms of POTS was the condition's emotional effect. At 14, all I wanted was to spend time with my friends, play on the soccer team, join classes and extracurricular activities. But with the fatigue, pain, and brain fog I was experiencing, participating in my former life felt impossible.\nLooking back as a healthy 20-something, I can still vividly remember the questions that broke against the shore of my mind over and over during that time: Why is this happening to me? Will I ever finish high school? What if I feel like this for the rest of my life?\nSome days were worse than others. I remember my mother's hushed voice as she called the school administrator: \"She won't be coming in today. We'll try again tomorrow.\"\nOn the days I did go to school, I had little in common with my friends, who had been supportive at the beginning but soon moved on with their own lives, tired of asking me how I was feeling.\nUnlike them, I didn't have the luxury of forgetting I was sick.\nIf sheer willpower could have gotten me past my symptoms, it would have—I'd never wanted to go to school or get out of bed so badly. But my body couldn't keep up with what my mind wanted from it, and that was the source of a whole lot of distress.\nLuckily, my parents were determined to get to the bottom of my mysterious health issues, and eventually found a diagnostician well-versed in rare diseases. After just a few minutes, the diagnostician finally had an answer: POTS.\nHe claimed that when he shook my hand at the beginning of the appointment it was cold, then when he examined me a few minutes later it was warm—a telltale sign of dysautonomia.\nA table test (in which my blood pressure was taken while I was sitting, lying down, and then standing) confirmed the diagnosis.\nThe battle with POTS was just beginning, but finally I was armed with a word for my suffering, a condition I could blame for my fast-paced teenage life grinding so suddenly to a halt.\nReading stories of people suffering from Long Covid and POTS, I'm instantly brought back to that phase in my life. I remember feeling like a stranger in my own body, constantly fighting against it to get through each day.\nDoctors, friends, and healthy people didn't understand—the symptoms were overpowering, and the fear that they would always be there only added to the exhaustion.\nGetting a diagnosis lit a fire under me, even though there was no cure for POTS and little treatment for the condition doctors still didn't seem to understand. By the time I saw a dysautonomia specialist, I had already missed most of ninth grade, and was desperately worried about what that meant for my future.\nI wish I could say I was given some magical cure, a pill I popped once that made the symptoms subside, or an exorcism that took the dysautonomia from my body. Instead, I was recommended an exercise regimen and prescribed medication that helped my body pump blood and manage water retention.\nMy muscles had atrophied after months of disuse, and that plus the fatigue made exercising difficult. But I did the best I could, determined to get back to \"normal\" life, no matter what it took.\nBy the start of my sophomore year of high school (my teachers mercifully passed me onto the next grade despite my spotty attendance), I could at least go to a few classes a day, although my once steady attention span had dissolved into intense brain fog that made it difficult to recall simple words.\nDesperate to get away from my reputation as a sick girl and the couch where I'd spent most of my hours for the past year, I applied for a study abroad program in Italy and was accepted.\nAlthough I can't say for sure, I believe that the six months I went on to spend in Italy cured me of POTS.\nI can make no medical claims (nor did my doctors have any insight), but my suspicion is that the slower pace of life, cleaner diet, and generally more joyful lifestyle in Italy worked wonders for my health.\nSix days a week I'd ride my bike along the beach in Rimini from my host family's apartment to my high school, even though the motion of pedaling made my muscles scream.\nI'd follow along in class as best I could from 8am until 1pm, then bike home again for a three-course meal, complete with a glass of wine and a cup of espresso.\nAfter lunch, the whole house would nap—unlike in the U.S., where my packed schedule had stretched from 8am until 8pm without much free time, in Italy rest was part of each day.\nOn the weekends, I'd meet up with my friends to walk around the center of the city and chat, and despite more of a spiritual than religious upbringing, I went to church every week so I could hang out with my friends, who were all Catholic.\nI remember clutching the back of the church pew each time we had to stand during Mass, begging my body to stay standing for just a second longer, just a second longer... But the recognition of and surrender to a power greater than myself helped me release some of the mental burden of my experience with POTS.\nA few weeks after I returned home from Italy (just about two years after my symptoms had started) I woke up one morning healthy again.\nThere was no warning, no sign that this would be the day, just a sudden surge of energy I'd forgotten I was capable of. Joy seeped through every cell in my body—I finally felt like I could live my life rather than survive it.\nI took a run that morning for the first time in two years, tears streaming down my cheeks as I made it past one telephone pole and then another.\nI'm not a doctor nor a healer—I don't have the answers. Maybe it was a coincidence that my health returned after six months in Italy, or maybe it really was that active and pleasure-focused lifestyle that put my body back on the right track.\nAll I have to offer those who are suffering from Long Covid or POTS is a tiny sliver of hope: For me, POTS went away and has not come back. I wish that sweet relief on every single person suffering from these debilitating disorders.\nZanny Merullo Steffgen is a chronically ill freelance writer based in Colorado.

        "content": "If you told five-year-old me about the mental health challenges I would face starting in 6th grade, she wouldn't want to grow up. Though things have gotten a lot better since then, it's hard to forget the weight of what I went through during my middle school years. From severe bullying to isolation to chronic stress, my mental health journey has been a painful rollercoaster.\nStarting in elementary school, I was constantly the new kid, ostracized and put down by many of my peers. Fifth grade through middle school was the worst bullying I've ever experienced. In my small grade of 20, girls used me for homework answers, put me down, spread rumors, and yelled at me almost daily.\nIn 6th grade, some girls found my email and sent ruthless messages like \"You deserve nothing in life\" and \"No one will ever love you.\" After hearing that message multiple times, I started to believe it was true. I struggled with low self-esteem and faced constant depressive episodes.\nAs I entered high school, I constantly found myself dealing with high levels of stress. Soon, chronic stress infiltrated every part of my life, often to the point that I had to stay home because it made me physically ill.\nStress affected me both mentally and physically. I felt weaker than ever and was perpetually exhausted from lack of sleep, my mind constantly racing and overwhelmed by my workload, further fueled by my imposter syndrome. It felt like I was running a race with no finish line.\nPerhaps the saddest part was going through all these problems alone. While it's somewhat comforting to know other teenagers face similar issues, it's also sickening that our cries for help often go unnoticed.\nThe CDC reported that feelings of persistent sadness or hopelessness among teenagers grew by 40 percent from 2009 to 2019. Back in 6th grade, I had no one to turn to. But now, I'm becoming the person I needed.\nAllow me to introduce myself—I'm Anaiah Singh, the high school freshman behind an app revolutionizing how teens navigate mental health challenges.\nI've spent the last three months building HeartTalk, a peer-to-peer support app that offers teens a lifeline with supportive voice messages, allowing them to listen to and record audio messages of support for each other worldwide. It's like having a friend's comforting voice in your pocket during tough times. And I'm not stopping there—my mission is to encourage others to join the movement by recording their messages, creating a ripple of support worldwide.\nThe Instagram account promoting my app has reached over 30 million people worldwide, and the beta version of my app attracted over 3,000 users within just a couple of weeks.\nMore important than the numbers though, are the personal stories young people are sharing with me. One user, a 15-year-old girl, reached out to me to say: \"It's so helpful... I'm so glad something like that exists. Got me crying for good, and honestly, it did make my day better. I'd share it with all my friends and family.\"\nStories like these are why I decided to build my app—to help millions of other teens never suffer alone.\nEveryone wants to help someone, and I'm on a mission to find these people and connect them with the teens who need them most. Building this app is not just for the millions of teenagers in need of support. It's also to show 6th-grade me that someone out there wants to help her.\nAnaiah Singh is a 15-year-old student based in the Bay Area.

I felt out of control with my eating habits and constantly gained weight, which affected many aspects of my life.\nLast year, I finally cracked the code. I visualized and lived as the person I wanted to become. I embraced a life of consistency, beauty, and satisfaction, romanticizing everything I did, including the food I ate and the habits I formed. I wasn't just focused on being skinny but on being healthy and happy in my body.\nOne crucial step was to identify habits I could happily live with for the rest of my life. I made it all about things I loved and never deprived myself.\nI began by envisioning my ideal body and identifying who I wanted to become. For me, this meant losing weight, looking thinner, having some muscle, and looking healthy. I wrote down my goals, which helped manifest them into reality. I also hypnotized myself daily, visualizing how I felt in my dream body while eating delicious food.\nThrough this process, I discovered deep-seated beliefs that were sabotaging my weight loss efforts. I realized that my unhealthy dieting habits stemmed from watching my mom struggle with chronic dieting. By understanding these issues, I could reframe my mindset and stop self-sabotaging.\nI also learned to occupy my thoughts with something other than food. Finding new hobbies and interests helped reduce food noise and obsessive thoughts about eating. It was crucial to allow myself to lose weight without thinking of food as the enemy. I stopped depriving myself and embraced portion control. I continued eating foods I loved but in moderation.\nStudying the habits of naturally thin people was eye-opening. I noticed that they ate mindfully, slowly, and in smaller portions. They were also very active. While adopting all their habits was challenging, I focused on what worked for me and stayed strategic about my food choices.\nAccountability was vital. I tracked everything I ate to stay honest with myself. I learned to stop lying about food and face the reality of my eating habits. This helped me understand and address my binge-eating tendencies.\nI adopted an abundance mindset, allowing myself to enjoy my favorite treats daily without feeling deprived. This approach helped curb my cravings and maintain a healthy relationship with food. I also focused on improving my gut health by consuming diverse probiotics and prebiotics, which significantly reduced my junk food cravings.\nPlanning for indulgences, like going to an all-you-can-eat buffet, was essential. I ensured these events were occasional and balanced them with healthier meals. I learned not to put any food on a pedestal and to enjoy my meals fully, focusing on nutrition and satisfaction.\nRegular exercise became a non-negotiable part of my lifestyle. I found workouts I enjoyed, like weight lifting and strength training, and made them a consistent part of my routine. This helped me build muscle, boost my metabolism, and feel strong and empowered.\nFinally, I constantly reminded myself that my new habits made me happier and healthier than my old ones. This mindset shift helped me stay motivated and avoid self-sabotage. I acknowledged my triggers and worked on fixing underlying issues like gut health and regular medical check-ups to ensure no undiagnosed conditions hindered my progress.\nI managed to lose 40 pounds, going from 145 pounds to 105 pounds in a few months. Most of this was fat loss, and I did it while staying healthy and eating whatever I wanted. The key to my success was romanticizing my weight loss and allowing myself to lose weight without deprivation.\nMae Alice Suzuki is a self-development YouTuber and Content Creator, taking her audience on a journey of healing and empowerment, to level up and create their dream realities.\nAll views expressed are the author's own.\nDo you have a unique experience or personal story to share?

If they ask questions, try to answer in a straightforward but age-appropriate way.\"\nOne particular book that Dartford said really helped was The Great Big Book of Families by Mary Hoffman, which she said was \"incremental\" in navigating Father's Day.\nIn preparation for this Sunday, Dartford also spoke to her daughter's school and asked if they could be mindful of the situation and not put so much emphasis on having to write a card for a dad.\n\"I've got some amazing male friends in my life who are fantastic dads and Zuri sees that; she has play dates with their children.\n\"I surround Zuri with remarkable role models who I can also call my friends.\"\nLindholm says having other male role models is an excellent mechanism for single moms on Father's Day.\n\"Father's Day can be an opportunity to honor the other men in your life,\" she says.\n\"Male role models can be uncles, grandfathers, coaches or others who aren't part of your kids' daily lives.\n\"I also know other moms who have created their own rituals, and one example comes from an article on ESME, where the children's father had died, so they do all the things he used to love to do, such as put on a jersey and watch the soccer and eat Vegemite.\"\nDartford is familiar with this reframing and uses Father's Day to celebrate the unique bond she has with Zuri.\nOn the day itself, they'll be celebrating with Zuri's grandfather. \"It will be a day of support, love, nourishment, all the all the good stuff. I know that my sister will also come and bring me flowers and wish me a happy Father's Day,\" says Dartford.\nDartford is also into her fitness, so they'll also be participating in the Turf Games (and Turf Kids for Zuri)—a team-based competitive fitness event in London.\n\"There's something quite interesting about what might be considered a bit of a stereotypical man's job on the actual day,\" muses Dartford.\n\"But Zuri will be there, cheering me on lifting weights.\"\nNaturally, Dartford dedicates her whole life to ensuring that Zuri's well-being is taken care of and admitted that she often puts herself last: \"I have to be gentle on myself and be aware that things look different for us, but that doesn't mean it's bad.\"\nLindholm can relate. As a mom of five (Marika has two children with her ex-husband and three children with her current spouse, two of whom are adopted), she understands the never-ending balance.\n\"Women who parent on their own are sleep deprived, work too hard and do everything for their kids 24/7, and maybe this is the moment they say, 'wow, look what I've done this past year' look how much I've accomplished and what a great mother I am.\"\nManes reassures single moms that it's OK to want self-recognition \"for how tough it can be to fulfill maternal and paternal function.\n\"Do something special for yourself, even if it's carving out an hour to take a walk-cry.\n\"If you have other single mother friends, find something fun to do together. Nothing is stopping you from making your own kind of party.\"\nFather's Day for single moms isn't just about coping and getting through the day. It's about celebrating the unique journey they are on.\nBy creating new traditions, seeking support and maintaining open communication, single moms can navigate the complexities of the day with grace and strength.\nDartford said: \"I've made a decision for the protection, development and safety of my daughter, and we may not fit in with the standard Father's Day, but I know that this will pay off in the long run because she'll have a stable future.\"\n",

Many people asked why she can't take public transport, however Arriaga told Newsweek that it's already an hour in an Uber so \"it would take way longer\" by bus or train.\nShe said: \"I don't have a car currently, and I have another job that I do before going to the one that's 14 miles away, with only an hour gap in between. I wouldn't have time to take public transportation as it would take about an hour longer on the bus or train.\"\nShe's been in the role since December 2023, but after moving to a new place this month, she only started taking daily Ubers in June 2024. The journeys currently cost Arriaga $100 a day, and $500 across the full week.\nIt was incredibly \"annoying\" to see $100 leave her account each day, but Arriaga's worked out an arrangement with her employer whereby they will reimburse $50 a day for the costs. She's incredibly thankful for the help, as the Ubers will no longer be \"as much of a loss,\" and it's only going to last for a month.\n\"The office is moving closer to me at the end of the month, which is why I'm OK with paying that much for the commutes for now,\" she added.\nAccording to figures from Statista, the majority of workers (29 percent) have a commute of around 15 to 29 minutes in length, and 22 percent spend less than 15 minutes commuting. Traveling more than an hour, as Arriaga does, was much less popular among commuters, as just 5 percent of people have a journey of between 60 to 119 minutes.\nFollowing the pandemic, remote working became increasingly popular and has become a legacy for many companies. With that in mind, 23 percent, the second highest figure, don't commute to work at all.\nAfter Arriaga posted on TikTok to express her dismay over \"losing money\" on Uber rides, social media users were divided by her choice of transport. Many suggested that she should choose a cheaper alternative.\n\"Half of the comments relate to it, since some people have no other way to get to work, and it does cut into their paycheck. The other half don't fully understand why I do it, so they just assume I'm dumb and are fighting in the comments,\" Arriaga told Newsweek.\nShe never expected the video to go viral, just thinking it was funny and might be intriguing to her followers. But after receiving a lot of questions and backlash online, Arriaga posted a follow-up video providing people with more information about her predicament.\nSpending so much money on Ubers each day has certainly generated attention online, and the viral TikTok video has amassed over 2,100 comments in just a matter of days. One comment reads: \"It's time to just get up an hour earlier and take the bus.\"\nAnother person responded: \"This makes me so glad I can drive and I live 10 minutes away from my job.\"\nWhile others were more understanding, as one TikToker user wrote: \"This was me, literally working to pay for Ubers because by the end of the week my whole check was going to Uber.\"\nAnd another comment says: \"These $40 a day Ubers are literally draining my account.\"\nDo you have a monetary dilemma?

From breast enhancements to botulinum toxin, the result and recovery time may differ, but all these treatments are for often one reason only: looks.\nWith Statista revealing 70% of U.S. consumers considered some form of cosmetic procedure in 2023, there's bound to be a few regrets of overfilled lips or unnecessary nose jobs, but people are slow to admit they made mistakes when it comes to treatments. One woman is now owning up to her moments of misjudgment in the hopes of educating others on the importance of properly considering your options before booking in.\nMarta Mielczarska, a 30-year-old content creator living in Los Angeles, shared a TikTok video detailing five cosmetic treatments she'd undergone—and the reasons she regretted them.\nThe video has since gone viral, with over 100,000 views since it was shared in April, as users listened to Mielczarska's reasoning for why she regrets each treatment.\nMielczarska, who was \"blessed with giant eye bags,\" turned to under eye filler as an alternative to a fat removal surgery, as she said \"nobody's cutting me up near my eyes.\"\nAdmitting in the video, \"I know I'm not the best candidate for [this treatment] because I don't have hollow eyes,\" the filler added more volume to her face, with her sharing that although it did get rid of the bags she felt she \"just looked very almost swollen.\"\nSpeaking to Newsweek, Mielczarska shared \"The filler worked, however, to achieve the look we also had to put a little bit of filler in my cheeks to even out my face which gave me a overfilled, puffy face look.\"\nLuckily the filler has naturally thinned over the years, as she shared, \"I do not think I need to get it dissolved because the look I have now after three years is natural and not overfilled anymore.\"\nSticking to the injectables category, Mielczarska admitted, \"I've had some bad Botox before in my life. It did not look cute.\n\"Same goes for the lip filler. I've found a really good person, but I've had some really bad lip filler before.\"\nHer main regret for these treatments weren't the procedures themselves, but the practitioners she chose to see, as she told Newsweek, \"It's difficult because you don't know until you know. You always think that people who do injections know what they are doing since it is literally their profession.\n\"I was looking for cheapest options and that is not always the best when it comes to your face. Now, I have a couple of trusted places for specific things and I will not be experimenting with new ones to not make any mistakes again.\"\nAnother area she wished she'd left alone was her eyebrows, as she said in the video: \"I've done it probably eight years ago, and it was supposed to last only a year, but it's still there and it's not going away.\n\"It just looks very weird and faded. They did a really good job, but still, I wish I never got it.\"\nSpeaking to Newsweek, Mielczarska admitted to being influenced by others when it came to this treatment, as she shared, \"Microblading was popping and I hopped on the trend.\n\"I also remember being 20 and waking up with friends at the same house and my girlfriend making a comment asking, 'Marta, where are your eyebrows?' and that made me even more self-conscious .\n\"At the time I liked the results because I finally had eyebrows, but now they look faded and not as fresh and I do not want to redo them as the trend has passed. I was not blessed with a lot of brow hair as I am naturally blonde, so I am still searching for a better solution for lush 'trendy' brows.\"\nSomething she called a \"serious addiction,\" Mielczarska is pulling back on her lash extensions, despite them being part of her routine for eight years.\nShe told Newsweek, \"They make my life so easy cause I wake up and I am ready to go. I took a little break during COVID because salons were closed, but I was putting falsies almost every day which was extremally annoying.\n\"Now, I am just torn in between convenience and nature. I want a natural look and I see the videos of girls getting them removed and they look absolutely beautiful and much better without them, but somehow I cannot explain to myself that I will look better when I take them off.\"\nAfter a botched initial surgery, Mielczarska was forced to go under the knife for a second time just a few years later. Upon reflection, she shared that, \"I wish I never did it, and I'm really considering an explant right now.\"\nShe told Newsweek, \"From what I hear, a lot of surgeons suggest you go bigger than you want for your first augmentation cause you will regret going too small and this is what I did—which I absolutely shouldn't).\n\"I have a fairly small frame and the implants that were put on me the first time looked absolutely ridiculous! I felt like it's the breast and me behind them. They completely did not match my frame or my personality.\n\"On top of that, three years after, I had complication—double bubble, when the implant drops below the pocket creating the look of a double bubble—and I hated looking at myself in the mirror.\"\nAfter seeking help from a new doctor she was able to get the results she'd initially wanted, but despite that Mielczarska said, \"I could not be happier with the new results, but in general I wish I never got it because looking from the perspective I was young and I definitely did not need that to feel confident.\n\"Now I am thinking about having plastic in my body and it does not make me feel good. I do not know if I am going to be brave enough to remove them completely, but maybe one day!\"\nOverall, her experiences have made her rethink the way she approaches cosmetic treatments, as she said, \"I am definitely not going to be doing any major treatments ever again, but rather focus more on my skin condition and smaller things like anti-wrinkle injections.\n\"All the mistakes I made were because I was young, I did not have money to get good care and right treatment and I was not educated enough in that area. Now I know better how to make the right choice and have trusted places that I know will not let me make those mistakes again.\"\n",

We're standing together against this illegal aggression,\" Biden said. President Vladimir Putin of Russia \"cannot wait us out,\" Biden added. \"He cannot divide us. We will be with Ukraine until they prevail.\"\nZelensky called the security agreement \"historic\" in remarks alongside Biden after both leaders formally signed the pact.\n\"We have signed the strongest agreement with Ukraine and the U.S since our independence,\" Zelensky said. \"It clearly states America's efforts to help Ukraine win this war.\"\nThe agreement commits the U.S. to provide Ukraine with continued military training, defense and intelligence cooperation and other security assistance.\nUnder the deal the U.S. will \"support the full range of Ukraine's current defensive needs now and over the long-term,\" according to a White House memo on the agreement.\nThe pact does not include a commitment by the U.S. to send American troops to Ukraine in the event of a future attack.\nBiden has said since Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022 that he would not send U.S. troops to Ukraine. Zelensky has not asked for foreign troops, saying that Ukraine can defend itself if it continues receiving weapons and other military aid from its allies.\nZelensky has also pushed for Ukraine to join NATO, whose members are committed to defend each other if a country in the alliance is attacked. The U.S. and other allies have expressed support for Ukraine's eventual ascension to NATO while also signaling that it's unlikely until the war with Russia is over.\nThe White House memo called the deal \"a key part of Ukraine's bridge to NATO membership.\"\n\"Ukraine's future is in NATO,\" the memo said.\nA debate about the timeline for Ukraine's membership will be front and center at this year's NATO summit, which takes place next month in Washington, D.C.\nAdministration officials said the security deal was a significant step in bolstering ties between the U.S. and Ukraine, despite the fact that it falls short of a NATO-style mutual defense pact.\nThe agreement is a \"real marker of our commitment, not just for this month, this year, but for many years ahead, to continue to support Ukraine, both in defending against Russian aggression and in deterring future aggression,\" National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Thursday ahead of the press conference and signing ceremony.\nThe deal is legally binding. But it can be reversed by a future president, since it is not a treaty that requires ratification by Congress.\nSpeculation about whether Donald Trump would undo the agreement if he wins the 2024 election began even before the deal was signed Thursday at the summit in Italy.\nAs a candidate Trump has sent mixed signals on Ukraine. He did not stand in the way of Republicans supporting a major security package for Ukraine that Congress approved earlier this year after a lengthy delay.\nStill, Trump has expressed concern at times about continued U.S. spending on Ukraine. He also said that he would end the war in one day as president, though he didn't say how.\nDuring his presidency Trump withdrew from the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal.\nBiden and Zelensky did not focus on Trump or what he might do during their joint appearance Thursday in Italy.\nThe meeting between Biden and Zelensky comes one week after the leaders met in France on the sidelines of the 80th anniversary commemoration of D-Day.\nBiden is scheduled to meet Friday with Italian Prime Minister Georgia Meloni and other G7 leaders as well as Pope Franics before flying back to the U.S.\n",

        "content": "Senate Republicans on Thursday blocked a bill put forth by Democrats to codify broad federal protections for in vitro fertilization (IVF) nationwide.\nOnly two Republicans sided with Democrats in the 48-47 vote: Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.\nThe IVF process involves extracting eggs from a woman's ovaries and fertilizing them with sperm in a laboratory. The fertilized eggs, or embryos, are then cultured before being implanted into the woman's uterus.\nIVF treatment became a heated political topic after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling federally guaranteeing abortion access, in June 2022. In February, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos used in IVF must legally be treated as children under state law, but the decision was later reversed by the state Legislature.\nRepublican senators criticized the Democrats' Right to IVF Act, which needed 60 votes to pass, as overreaching in its aim. Instead, they had submitted their own legislation, which Democrats said didn't go far enough and blocked on Wednesday.\nOn Thursday, Murkowski explained her vote in a post to X, formerly Twitter.\n\"In vitro fertilization is a crucial part of reproductive health, allowing couples with fertility challenges to grow their families. Today I voted to move to consider 'The Right to IVF Act,' legislation that would establish in federal statute the right for an individual to access IVF treatment, which has been called into question at the state level,\" she said.\n\"I have significant reservations about the bill's overly broad mandates for insurers to pay for treatment costs—but I want to be clear on my support for a family's right to access IVF. I hope that we can work toward a bipartisan solution to protect access to IVF.\"\nNewsweek contacted Collins' office via email on Thursday for comment.\nPresident Joe Biden denounced the Senate members who didn't support the act in a written statement.\n\"Once again, Senate Republicans refused to protect access to fertility treatments for women who are desperately trying to get pregnant,\" Biden said. \"And just last week, Senate Republicans blocked nationwide protections for birth control. The disregard for a woman's right to make these decisions for herself and her family is outrageous and unacceptable.\"\nRepublican Senator John Cornyn of Texas explained to reporters after the vote why he didn't support the legislation.\n\"Why should we vote for a bill that fixes a non-existent problem? There's not a problem. There's no restrictions on IVF, nor should there be,\" Cornyn said, according to CNN.\n",

The move comes as state and federal officials grapple with a spike in border encounters in recent years. The rise in opioid use and overdoses in the U.S. has also been linked to drug smuggling across the southern border.\n\"Our top priority is the safety of our communities statewide,\" Newsom said in the release. \"By working with state, local, and federal partners to take down transnational organizations and the illegal drugs they attempt to bring into our state, the state's Counter Drug Taskforce is making a profound difference to hold smugglers accountable and take deadly drugs off our streets.\"\nFrom January through April, California's National Guard, also known as CalGuard, said that it seized over 5.8 million fentanyl pills, including more than 2.3 million in April alone. According to CalGuard Major General Matthew Beevers, the state Counter Drug Taskforce deployed 30 service members in 2022 to points of entry in Southern California at San Ysidro, Otay Mesa, Tecate and Calexico.\n\"Due to significant initial success, in 2023, we doubled our force across those Ports of Entry,\" Beevers added, as quoted in the release. \"Under Governor Newsom's leadership and broad Congressional support, our Counter Drug Taskforce has grown from 155 full-time service members to 392 today.\"\nNewsweek reached out to Newsom's office via email on Thursday for additional information.\nDrug-related overdoses have spiked across the U.S. in recent years. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, accounted for the most drug overdose deaths in 2022. As Newsom's office noted in its release on Thursday, the majority of fentanyl that is smuggled into the country is carried out by U.S. citizens. In 2022, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, 88 percent of offenders trafficking fentanyl were American citizens.\nThe CDC reported that the state with the highest rate of drug-related deaths in 2022 was West Virginia, with 80.9 deaths per 100,000 residents. Other locations topping the CDC's list for that year, all per 100,000 residents, were: the District of Columbia (64.3 deaths), Tennessee (56 deaths) and Delaware (55.3 deaths).\nCalifornia had among the lower drug-related death rates in 2022, at 26.9 deaths per 100,000 residents.

        "content": "Bishop Mark Seitz has seen countless immigrants come and go during his years of service in the southern border city of El Paso, telling Newsweek that challenging the policies and narratives of Texas Governor Greg Abbott and other officials is sometimes necessary to protect the most vulnerable.\nIn 2013, Pope Francis appointed Seitz as the bishop of El Paso, and during his decade-plus tenure, he has focused on migrant families and refugees, whether they settle in the city or pass through to their next destination. The Diocese of El Paso, which was instituted on March 3, 1914, covers about 26,700 square miles, its website says—including nine Texas counties, 56 parishes and 18 missions, serving a Catholic population of 686,000.\nAs the broader national immigration debate has hit a boiling point, the bishop has felt it imperative to speak out on migrants' behalf. He has criticized Abbott and other Texas lawmakers for attempting to expand the state's authority over immigration through legislative efforts—such as Senate Bill 4, which would allow law enforcement and the Texas National Guard to arrest, detain and deport migrants suspected of being in the country illegally. The legislation remains pending because of a lower-court ruling.\n\"I really try to frame whatever I say as policies and not persons,\" Seitz told Newsweek via phone. \"That's really the concern that we have, and we don't seek to make issues personal as such. But if it challenges a person, then fine.\"\nSeitz, who chairs the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' Committee on Migration, has been vocal about the placing of razor wire to deter migrants crossing the Rio Grande.\nIn March, he referred to such efforts as \"transparently political\" and part of a \"broader, brutal, historical project in Texas to criminalize and police people who migrate.\"\n\"People of faith have a duty to resist these racist projects,\" he added.\nSeitz said that while people will naturally have their own set of principles, sometimes the reason for differences is not understanding what is factually occurring, which requires speaking out.\nNewsweek has contacted Abbott's office for comment via email.\nSeitz said the church isn't arguing about the existence of borders or a country enforcing an orderly process. However, he added that the church should be telling certain \"actors\" who say they're motivated by their faith to identify the \"recognition of human dignity\" as a starting point in honest conversation.\n\"I live on the border. I work all the time with Border Patrol and other enforcement agencies and immigrants,\" the bishop said. \"I speak from that awareness as well. What are they experiencing? What are we going through on the border every day?\"\nHe said that lawmakers \"very often\" use isolated incidents that are \"replayed over and over and over\" to give outsiders an impression of what the situation on the 1,950-mile-long border between the U.S. and Mexico is like.\n\"There are claims of violence, especially given the high numbers [of illegal border crossings] in recent years,\" he said. \"I think occasions when anything violent happened are extremely rare.\"\n\"The truth is, immigrant communities—people who make them up—are much less likely to commit any kind of crime compared to groups born into the United States. We haven't in El Paso experienced an increase of crime in these years in general, and we haven't seen an increase in immigrants even though these people come with nothing,\" he added.\nAside from Abbott, Seitz has chastised Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.\nOn February 20, Paxton sued Annunciation House, a Catholic nongovernmental organization in El Paso, alleging it should have its operation license in the state revoked for facilitating illegal entry to the United States, harboring illegal migrants, human smuggling and operating a stash house.\nThe following month, a judge called into question Paxton's \"true motivation\" for going after an NGO that provides humanitarian and social services—adding that the lawsuit may have violated \"fair play\" without due process.\n\"Annunciation House is being completely mischaracterized,\" Seitz said. \"If there's any bulwark against human trafficking of these vulnerable immigrants, if there's anything to prevent child trafficking and the like, it's the existence of an NGO like Annunciation House.\"\nThe presence of the NGO, which has been part of the community for almost 50 years, also prevents street releases of unidentified migrants, the bishop said, adding, \"If we didn't have Annunciation House, we'd see human trafficking at levels we never imagined.\"\nSeitz's criticism has extended beyond conservative officials in his own state.\nHe said he was \"deeply disturbed\" following President Joe Biden's recent border order suspending asylum processing between ports of entry when numbers exceed 2,500 per day. The order, based on decades-old law, has already faced legal threats from groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union.\nThe order is a response to what Seitz describes as a nation with a \"crisis of conscience.\" He said that while the immigration system needed to be revamped, many migrants were being vilified when they just wanted to improve their lives.\n\"It's extremely damaging and destructive to them,\" Seitz said. \"It really harms them from becoming productive members of society. We're hurting ourselves a certain way if we don't allow a pathway to gain refuge.\"\n",

        "content": "A new study by Harvard social science researchers suggests that aliens may have been living on Earth for a while.\nThe research paper—which is yet to be peer-reviewed—suggests that life forms from other worlds could be living underground on Earth or within the moon, and that UFOs and other unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) may in fact be evidence for them getting around.\nThe study suggests an \"unconventional\" explanation for UAP, with the authors of the paper hailing from Harvard University's Human Flourishing Program, which researches the factors that contribute to human well-being and flourishing.\nUAP are any objects or phenomena that cannot be immediately identified or explained by known human-made or natural sources. The authors point out that the \"A\" in UAP represents \"anomalous\" in their study, rather than \"aerial\" as is commonly the case, because some UAP are not only airborne but may travel underwater.\nUAP have been reported in various forms, including spheres, discs, triangles, and other shapes, ranging in size from small orbs to large craft. Many exhibit flight patterns and maneuvers that defy conventional aerodynamics, such as sudden changes in direction, high speeds, and the ability to hover without apparent propulsion systems.\nLast summer, 36-year-old air force veteran David Grusch caused a media storm after he said that a top-secret U.S. military program had found the wreckage of several fully intact unidentified aerial craft, some of which contained dead non-human pilots.\nA 2023 report from the Office for the Director of National Intelligence found that there were 510 UAP sightings in 2022, higher than the 366 seen in 2021. Of these, 171 were considered to \"appear to have demonstrated unusual flight characteristics or performance capabilities, and require further analysis.\"\n\"Hypotheses for such phenomena tend to fall into two classes: a conventional terrestrial explanation (e.g., human-made technology), or an extraterrestrial explanation (i.e., advanced civilizations from elsewhere in the cosmos),\" the Harvard researchers wrote in the new paper.\n\"However, there is also a third minority class of hypothesis: an unconventional terrestrial explanation, outside the prevailing consensus view of the universe,\" they wrote. \"This is the ultraterrestrial hypothesis, which includes as a subset the 'cryptoterrestrial' hypothesis, namely the notion that UAP may reflect activities of intelligent beings concealed in stealth here on Earth (e.g., underground), and/or its near environs (e.g., the moon), and/or even \"walking among us\" (e.g., passing as humans).\"\nIn the paper, the researchers discuss four theories of how aliens may be living alongside us, the first of which—the human cryptoterrestrials theory—suggests that there may be an ancient human civilization much more technologically advanced than our own that has somehow survived in secret.\nThe second theory is that there is a technologically advanced non-human civilization that evolved on Earth in secret, created by an ape-like hominid or some \"unknown, intelligent dinosaurs.\"\nThe third suggests that there are aliens or humans from the future that live on the Earth in secret, and the fourth suggests there are \"magical cryptoterrestrials\" akin to \"earthbound angels,\" which the researchers compare to \"fairies, elves, nymphs.\"\n\"The principal weakness of [the final theory], by contrast, is its utter strangeness, particularly for readers schooled to limit themselves to modes of explanation within the bounds of, say, the standard model of physics,\" the researchers write in the paper. \"While belief in extraterrestrials is tenable, belief in (something like) fairies is simply not a live option for many scientists.\n\"Although this idea is likely to be regarded skeptically by most scientists, such are the nature of some UAP that we argue this possibility should not be summarily dismissed, and instead deserves genuine consideration in a spirit of epistemic humility and openness.\"\nHowever, the majority of experts in the field do not believe that UFOs or UAP are evidence of extraterrestrial activity.\n\"I think these encounters capture the imagination differently for different people,\" Joshua Semeter, a professor of electrical and computer engineering and director of the Center for Space Physics at Boston University, previously told Newsweek. \"As a technologist, my speculation is that some form of advanced technology may be at play. But I remain confident that it is human technology. There are next-generation propulsion systems that could account for the unfamiliar flight characteristics observed.\n\"For me, the leap to speculations about aliens is a leap too far. But it is important to retain an open mind as we solve this mystery.\"\nDo you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering? Do you have a question about UAPs?

        "content": "New York-based company Aahu Barah has issued a recall of several boxes of its dessert Apricot Roll over some products containing undeclared sulfites.\nAccording to a news release shared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets Food Inspectors discovered the undeclared sulfites after analysis by the department's Food Laboratory. Those who have a sensitivity to sulfites are at risk of a serious or life-threatening reaction if they consume products containing the undeclared allergen, read the release.\nRead more: What Is a Health Savings Account?\nThe recall applies to 19 boxes of the 14-ounce apricot rolls, which were sold in clear plastic bags and packaged with the Aahu Barah label on the front and back. The expiration date of the rolls included in the recall is December 2025. The UPC code of the affected products is 882475000279.\nThe boxes were distributed in retail stores across six states: New York, Texas, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Georgia.\nUnder FDA guidelines, the presence of sulfites must be declared on food products if the sulfites present are at 10 parts per million or more. Sulfites are not one of the nine major allergens required to be listed on a food products label under the Food Allergy, Treatment, Education and Research Act.\nRead more: Find the Right Tax-Advantaged Health Savings Account\nAccording to the Cleveland Clinic, sulfites are chemicals used as preservatives in food, beverages and medications. Around 4 to 5 percent of people with asthma also have some sort of sulfite sensitivity. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, around 7.4 percent of the U.S. population had asthma in 2021.\nSulfites can trigger asthma attacks and allergic reactions in those who are sensitive. Symptoms of a sulfite allergy or sensitivity include wheezing; shortness of breath; chest tightness; coughing; sneezing; a stuffy or runny nose; and hives, according to the Cleveland Clinic's website. In rare occasions, severe allergic reactions can be trigged by exposure to sulfites, which can cause difficulty breathing or swallowing; flushing of the skin; fast heartbeat; dizziness vomiting; and diarrhea.\nThose who have asthma or other food allergies are more likely to react to sulfites. According to the FDA release, there have been no reported illnesses or allergic reactions associated with the recall.\nConsumers who have purchased an apricot roll under the recall are urged to return it to the retail store where they purchased it, for a full refund. Any questions about the recall can be directed to Aahu Barah at 516-396-0710.\n",

        "content": "A video of President Joe Biden supposedly \"wandering\" from leaders at the Group of Seven (G7) summit Thursday has gone viral on social media, although some users have pointed out that the 30-second clip lacks context.\nThe video appears to have first been shared to X, formerly Twitter, by the account RNC Research, which is managed by former President Donald Trump's campaign and the Republican National Committee.\nIn the clip, Biden and the other G7 leaders are seen applauding a skydiving demonstration when the president turns to his left and walks toward a man packing up a parachute, and away from the gathering of world officials. It is not clear what Biden said to the man but he is seen giving him a thumbs-up before Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni taps the president on the shoulder and gestures for him to return to the group, where they appear to pause for a photo opportunity.\nSeveral Republicans have shared the video on social media and used it to express concerns over Biden's mental capacity. Critics of the president, who turns 82 in November, have repeatedly claimed that he is too old or infirm to serve another term.\nBiden is the presumptive Democratic nominee for the November presidential election, poised for a likely rematch with Trump, who turns 78 on Friday. The former president has also elicited worries from some regarding his own mental acuity.\n\"WHAT IS BIDEN DOING?\" the RNC Research account wrote in its post to X, which as of 4:25 p.m. EST had been viewed over 1.2 million times.\nConservative commentator Collin Rugg also shared RNC Research's video clip to his X account, writing in the post, \"President Biden appears to start wandering off at the G7 summit and has to be handled back in.\"\n\"Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni was seen grabbing Biden to bring him back to the group ... Clown show,\" Rugg said.\nMedia personality Clay Travis, a longtime Trump supporter, also reshared the video and wrote on X, \"Joe Biden just goes wandering off at the G7 meeting. Another national leader has to retrieve him. They are babysitting our president in Italy.\"\nNewsweek sent an email to the White House press office for comment on Thursday.\nA few X users spoke up in defense of the president, including online personality Brian Krassenstein, who called the video \"another attack without context.\"\n\"As you can see at the 4 second mark, 8 of the 10 world leaders, including Biden are looking towards the man on the right packing the parachute,\" Krassenstein wrote on X. \"Biden began saying something to him as the others had their attention shifted in the other direction because another man began talking to the group suddenly.\"\n\"Once again, focusing on an edited-down 30-second clip doesn't tell a full story,\" he added. \"Stop being disingenuous.\"\nLast week, a video of Biden at a D-Day anniversary event in Normandy, France, went viral after, critics said, it appeared to show that the president was attempting to sit in a chair that didn't exist. As the Associated Press later reported, however, a full clip of the moment shows that Biden looked over his shoulder for his chair and paused before taking a seat.\nUpdate 06/13/24, 9:48 p.m. ET: The headline of this article has been updated to include additional context.\n",

Justice Thomas never disclosed these, raising further questions about the accuracy of his disclosures.\"\nJustice Thomas and Crow previously faced criticism after a ProPublica report published in April 2023 detailed \"luxury trips\" accepted by Justice Thomas. Defending the trips, Justice Thomas issued a statement saying in part, \"Early in my tenure at the Court, I sought guidance from my colleagues and others in the judiciary, and was advised that this sort of personal hospitality from close personal friends, who did not have business before the Court, was not reportable. I have endeavored to follow that counsel throughout my tenure, and have always sought to comply with the disclosure guidelines,\" the statement previously obtained by Newsweek said.\nIn ProPublica, Crow also issued a statement saying in part, \"The hospitality we have extended to the Thomas's [sic] over the years is no different from the hospitality we have extended to our many other dear friends ... We have never asked about a pending or lower court case, and Justice Thomas has never discussed one, and we have never sought to influence Justice Thomas on any legal or political issue.\"\nIn the post on X, the Senate Judiciary Committee alleges that Justice Thomas did not disclose a trip he took in May of 2017 by plane from St. Louis, Missouri, to Kalispell, Montana, and then to Dallas, Texas.\nThe second trip the Senate Judiciary Committee alleges Justice Thomas did not disclose was a roundtrip flight in March 2019 from Washington, D.C., to Savannah, Georgia.\nThe third trip Thomas allegedly did not disclose was a roundtrip flight in June 2021 from Washington, D.C., to San Jose, California.\nThe post also includes recently disclosed trips Justice Thomas took that he updated in a financial report in May 2024. Those trips were to Bali, Indonesia, on July 12, 2019, and Monte Rio, California, dated July 18-21, 2019. Harlan Crow was listed as the source on both trips, according to the financial report.\nIn an emailed statement to Newsweek on Thursday, the Office of Harlan Crow said, \"Mr. Crow reached an agreement with the Senate Judiciary Committee to provide information responsive to its requests going back seven years. Despite his serious and continued concerns about the legality and necessity of the inquiry, Mr. Crow engaged in good faith negotiations with the Committee from the beginning to resolve the matter. As a condition of this agreement, the Committee agreed to end its probe with respect to Mr. Crow.\"\nNumerous people on social media have since reacted to the news on Thursday.\nDemocrat strategist and commentator Simon Rosenberg said on X, \"Clarence Thomas is among the most corrupt public officials in the history of the United States. It's staggering levels of corruption, lying and betrayal.\"\nDemocrat Congressman Bill Pascrell Jr. also said on X, \"Clarence Thomas is corrupt as hell and the corruption at the republican Supreme Court stinks to high heaven. Thomas should resign immediately and I urge all my colleagues to demand the same.\"\nUniversity of California, Berkeley professor and former U.S. Secretary of Labor under Democrat President Bill Clinton, Robert Reich said on X, \"The Senate Judiciary Committee just revealed three more undisclosed vacations that Clarence Thomas was gifted by Harlan Crow. This is on top of new reports that Thomas has received more than $4 million in gifts over the last two decades. I stand by my call for him to resign.\"\nLegal analyst Joyce Vance posted on X saying, \"Clarence Thomas took more undisclosed trips financed by GOP donor Harlan Crow, Senate committee finds. You shouldn't take the job if you're not willing to preserve the integrity of the courts & the rule of law.\"\nPreviously, Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton came to Justice Tomas' defense saying on June 7, 2024, on X, \"The smears against the great Justice Clarence Thomas are nothing more than bad-faith attempts to intimidate the Court. If leftists can't control an institution, they try to delegitimize it.\"\nNewsweek has reached out to the Supreme Court via email on Thursday for comment.\nUpdate 06/13/24 6:48 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.\n",

        "content": "Baby Boomers have sparked a notable change in the Social Security program.\nWhile experts previously anticipated funds would run out to pay full benefits in 2034, the Social Security Administration updated this prediction and said funds would actually not become insolvent until 2035, a year later.\nRead more: Best Place for Short-Term Investing: CD vs. High-Yield Savings Account\nAt this point, if nothing changes, the retirement benefit program would only be able to pay 77 percent of promised benefits to seniors who rely on the monthly income.\nBut why did the insolvency date move up, despite the increasing numbers of Baby Boomers reaching retirement age?\nBaby Boomers themselves are working longer, said Steve Goss, chief actuary of the Social Security Administration.\nGoss said on one hand, the economy improving and bringing in more revenue was helpful to Social Security's dwindling financial supply, but Baby Boomers also played a role in the changing deadline for the program.\nRead more: Long-Term Investment Strategies\n\"Employment rates have been very strong, and one of the things that's been really good... is the Baby Boom generation upon us, elders, are working at higher ages now,\" Goss said during today's hearing on Medicare and Social Security solvency.\nAccording to recent Pew Research and Gallup data, 19 percent of Americans aged 65 and older were still working last year, which is nearly double the rate of the late 1980s.\nAnd in the same year, 2023, the average retirement age was 62, an increase from 59 just roughly 20 years ago.\n\"One of the sad realities of our current economic landscape is in recent years there have been many Baby Boomers who have been unable to enjoy their golden years in the same way as the generation that came before them,\" Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor at the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek. \"Rising costs and more debt have been a deadly combination that has led many of them to stay in the workforce to be capable of continuing to have their current standard of living.\"\nThe Medicare trust fund saw similar improvements as Baby Boomers decide to work longer and often into retirement. While originally it had indicators it would be depleted by 2026, new reports estimate it has an extra 10 years of life before running out of money.\nThe move to work later is not just helping Baby Boomers as they look to their own Social Security checks but could have positive effects for younger generations as well, Beene said.\n\"Living expenses aren't getting any cheaper, and many Americans continue to want to maintain the lives they've cultivated and not cut back as much as some prior generations did in retirement,\" Beene said. \"Social Security still has some serious long-term solvency issues to work out, but generations of Americans that work longer are going to be able to help soften the blow of a funding pitfall.\"\nDrew Powers, the founder of Illinois-based Powers Financial Group, said he sees many of his own clients opting to work longer, especially as the look of retirement changes compared to previous generations.\n\"As they say, 70 is the new 60,\" Powers told Newsweek. \"With advancements in healthcare and technology, Baby Boomers today find it easier to work at an age where their parents, the Greatest Generation, would have found it difficult if not impossible. And with a strong economy, there is also a feeling among my clients that if they stay healthy, then there is no reason to retire until the current cycle ends.\"\nMany Baby Boomers aren't necessarily working longer out of their own volition, however. While previous generations often worked for the same employer for decades and received a fixed pension, that employer-provided security is typically gone for today's retirees.\n\"Those pensions were replaced by the 401k, and those accounts have seen multiple boom-bust cycles from the Dot-Com Bubble to the Covid Crash,\" Powers said. \"As the Boomers put off collecting benefits, it helps the Social Security fund from being depleted. Of course, these folks will eventually collect benefits, so the insolvency crisis is always looming.\"\nKevin Thompson, a finance expert and the founder/CEO of 9i Capital, said a large segment of seniors are working because they planned until retirement but failed to think about the day in and day out of life after retirement.\n\"They did a good job planning to retirement, but a poor job planning for retirement, meaning they truly do not know what their day-to-day lives look like and therefore push off the inevitable,\" Thompson told Newsweek.\nStill, Thompson doubts seniors staying in the workforce will have a material impact on Social Security funding in the long run.\n\"The individuals often working are the ones needing to supplement their fixed expenses and are likely taking social security while in the workforce,\" Thompson said. \"The amount of money going back into the system and money coming out of the system will be offset slightly, but not materially.\"\n",

She is competent but a sovereign citizen and refuses to participate in the process,\" the dismissal notice said. \"She has been incarcerated longer than any active sentence that could be reasonably be expected given the charges and her prior record level. On review, these charges are being dismissed in the interests of justice.\"\nThe offenses dropped included a trespass charge, resisting, and assaulting a government official.\nCase documents reveal that last July an officer was called to a home in a Charlotte neighborhood by the power company who were there to remove a power meter and were told to leave by Ninti El-Bey, who was in the property, but had been evicted. When the officer arrived, El-Bey refused to engage with them and \"barricaded\" into the home, the case documents reveal. Upon being told she was under arrest, El-Bey resisted and a scuffle broke out between her and the officer.\n\"After fighting and actively trying to resist and get away, the defendant was placed into custody,\" the arrest sheet said. \"Since the defendant was evicted and came back onto the property the defendant is to be charged with first degree trespass...and assault on a government official.\"\nCase documents show that the property that El-Bey had been staying at was \"locked\" by local authorities.\n\"Any person who enters upon this trailer lot without the express permission of the landlord may be charged with violation of the North Carolina Criminal Statues,\" the ejectment notice dated April 2022 included in the case file said.\nThe American Apartment Owners Association describes a squatter as anyone who occupies a property they have no legal right to.\nIn response to a request for comment, the Mecklenburg County District Attorney's office referred Newsweek to the case documents.\nNewsweek also contacted the area public defender's office for comment via email and a phone call.\nEight years ago, El-Bey was convicted of trespassing in what reports alleged that she had squatted in a property in the Charlotte neighborhood of Piper Glen, according to The Charlotte Observer. The home was vacant and occupied 5,200 square feet in what the outlet described as \"one of south Charlotte's finest neighborhoods.\"\nEl-Bey had moved into the house that boasted five bedrooms and five bathrooms which at the time was valued at $800,000, according to the newspaper.\nA judge found El-Bey guilty of first- and second-degree trespassing and breaking and entering, among other charges, and gave her a suspended sentence of 45 days in jail.\nSquatting as a phenomenon has garnered national attention after high-profile incidents of individuals occupying homes they may have no legal rights to. But experts also warn that these cases are rare and some landlords are abusing the issue's presence in the public sphere to deny rights to residents who may have legitimate claims. But lawmakers have attempted to pass legislation to mitigate against such cases.\n",

These developments suggest that Pyongyang is determined to open the getaway soon, although the exact date remains unknown.\nConstruction at Wonsan-Kalma, on the eastern side of the Korean peninsula about four hours from Pyongyang, started in 2018 with an initial completion target of 2020. The project has faced numerous setbacks, including delays caused by the pandemic​​.\nBut things seem to be back on track with repaving work completed after it began in the first week of May, along with advanced stages of construction visible throughout the resort, according to an analysis of before-and-after satellite photos. Beach chairs have even been set up in the central area.\nThe successful completion and operation of the resort could be a significant step toward achieving Kim Jong-un's vision of boosting the nation's tourism sector, which is tightly controlled.\nDuring its construction phase, Wonsan-Kalma has only hosted a limited number of visitors, including a media crew from Russia earlier this year. Russian tour companies have been notified about the imminent opening, but specific details remain scarce.\nThe progress on the complex aligns with recent news related to tourism efforts in North Korea. In March, Pyongyang announced that a group of Russian tourists went on a ski trip, becoming the first international visitors since the borders closed in January 2020.\nTwo months later, a Russian train carrying tourists departed for North Korea for the first time in four years, according to the Russian customs service, less than a month after a local governor announced the resumption of rail traffic in mid-May.\nThe expanding ties between North Korea and Russia come as they are locked in separate confrontations with the U.S. and its allies.\nPreparations are already underway in Pyongyang for Russian President Vladimir Putin's upcoming visit, which marks his first trip to North Korea since 2000. Moscow has suggested the visit will be soon, but neither side has announced visit dates.\nThe visit is part of a broader effort to strengthen ties between the two nations, particularly in light of increased military cooperation amid Russia's conflict with Ukraine. Putin is expected to visit Vietnam from June 19 to 20 and may visit North Korea on the same trip.\nIf the resort on Wonsan-Kalma intends to market itself to domestic travelers, a stay would need to be cheap — the average salary in North Korea, typically controlled by Kim's autocratic government, translates to about $3 dollars per month.\n",

        "content": "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is lashing out after the European Union fined his nation nearly $215 million for violating the EU's asylum and migration laws.\nThe EU's Court of Justice, based in Luxembourg, said in a statement issued Thursday that Hungary must pay a lump sum of 200 million euros and a penalty payment of 1 million euros per day of delay for failure to comply with a judgment derived from \"deliberately avoiding the application of a common EU policy as a whole,\" adding it constitutes \"an unprecedented and extremely serious infringement of EU law.\"\nOrban, a right-wing lawmaker and strong ally of former U.S. President Donald Trump, called the fines \"outrageous and unacceptable\" in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\"It seems that illegal #migrants are more important to the Brussels bureaucrats than their own European citizens,\" Orban said.\nThe court said that starting in December 2020, Orban and Hungary failed to comply with EU rules and procedures.\n\"That failure concerned restricting access to the international protection procedure, unlawfully detaining applicants for international protection in transit zones and failing to observe their right to remain in Hungarian territory pending a final decision on their appeal against the rejection of their application, as well as the removal of illegally staying third-country nationals,\" the court said.\nWhen Hungary purportedly didn't comply with EU protocols, aside from closing transit zones that had closed prior to the present judgment, the court was compelled to impose financial penalties.\nHungary's disregard toward migration and asylum laws was described by the court not just as evading common EU policy and the solidarity by member nations but imposes \"a serious threat to the unity of EU law, which has an extraordinarily serious impact both on private interests, particularly the interests of asylum seekers, and on the public interest.\"\nMore than 380,000 migrants crossed EU borders illegally last year, the most since 2016, according to the BBC.\nIn April, the EU Asylum and Migration Pact was approved—after negotiations dating to 2015—that beginning in two years is designed to speed up the asylum process and return \"irregular migrants\" to their native countries.\nThe 27 EU countries will be required to allocate additional resources to deal with illegal migration and asylum claims or take in the migrants.\nLast Saturday, ahead of EU Parliament elections in Hungary, tens of thousands of Orban protesters galvanized in Budapest in support of Péter Magyar, the leader of Hungary's strongest opposition party, Respect and Freedom (TISZA).\nMagyar has drawn support in opposing Orban, of the Fidesz right-wing party, not seen in well over a decade. He is vying to potentially challenge Orban in the country's next national election in 2026.\n",

At the time, Biden said the U.S. planned to invest $250 million in the project, which will create a route from Lobito Port in Angola through Zambia to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Eventually, future developments would expand the route into Tanzania, which would create a rail line route between the Indian and Atlantic oceans.\nThe project is part of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI), which is \"G7's flagship infrastructure and investment initiative,\" according to the White House. G7 is an intergovernmental political and economic forum consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.\nBiden recently touched on the PGI progress during the 2024 G7 Summit in Fasano, Italy, according to a White House fact sheet published on Thursday. During this year's summit, Italy committed $320 million of \"grant, equity and debt capital to finance a new 800-kilometer greenfield rail section of the envisioned first open-access trans-continental rail network,\" and the United Kingdom agreed to contribute funds for geological surveying along the corridor.\n\"President Biden also highlighted progress on PGI economic corridors that reflect how the USG is working with partners to boost infrastructure investment in emerging markets, emphasizing strategic economic corridor development for multisector impact across countries,\" the White House fact sheet said.\n\"Additionally, the United States accelerated support to develop the Lobito Economic Corridor, the PGI flagship economic corridor announced by President Biden at the 2023 G7 Summit, that supports critical transportation infrastructure in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Zambia, including the first open-access transcontinental rail network in Africa.\"\nNewsweek reached out to the White House via email for comment.\nOnce complete, the corridor will enable \"additional investment in agribusiness to enhance food security, digital infrastructure, and expanded access to clean power,\" according to the White House.\n\"PGI continues to pursue additional opportunities to connect the initial Lobito Corridor investments across the continent, to Tanzania and, ultimately, the Indian Ocean all while creating quality jobs and improving lives,\" the fact sheet said.\nOnce completed, the corridor will redirect mine products, such as metals like cobalt, copper, and lithium needed for electric vehicle battery production and wind turbines, to a port in Angola. This would cut down on export expenses and move resources more efficiently, according to a 2023 report by WRAL.\n",

Tactical nuclear weapons are designed for battlefield use, less powerful and widely destructive than strategic nuclear weapons.\nRussian state media announced the drills in early May, quoting the defense ministry as saying they came off the back of \"provocative statements and threats by some Western officials\" against Russia.\nThe more than two years of war in Ukraine have soured relations between Russia and Western countries to their worst point in decades. It has also brought concerns about the possible use of nuclear weapons back into the spotlight.\nProminent Russian officials, such as former President Dmitry Medvedev, and Russian state television commentators have frequently mentioned the prospect of nuclear war. Some state media hosts and guests have suggested that Moscow should launch nuclear strikes on countries, such as the U.S. and U.K, that support Kyiv's war effort.\n\"The idea of nuclear conflict, once unthinkable, has become a subject of debate,\" United Nations Secretary General António Guterres said in September 2022.\n\"For some reason, the West believes that Russia will never use it,\" Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier this month. \"If someone's actions threaten our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we consider it possible for us to use all means at our disposal.\"\nWithin NATO, only a few countries have nuclear weapons, but several European bases host U.S. tactical nuclear weapons.\nIn April, Polish President Andrzej Duda suggested Warsaw was willing to host U.S. nuclear weapons under a NATO policy known as \"nuclear sharing.\"\n",

        "content": "Water supplies in the U.S. are among the safest in the world, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports. But water quality does still vary from state to state. So which states have the best drinking water?\nThe Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) of 1974 was passed to protect public health in the U.S. by providing federal regulation of the nation's public drinking water supply. To meet these standards, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set limits on over 90 contaminants in drinking water, including chemical contaminants, like lead and arsenic, and microbial contaminants, like Giardia and Cryptosporidium.\nRead more: What Is a Health Savings Account?\nFailure to meet these limits can result in being cited with an official \"violation.\" The majority of safety violations recorded every year are a result of untimely water monitoring and reporting, but there are still thousands of annual health-related violations, which pose a real risk to the public.\nTo explore how these violations vary across different states, Newsweek compiled data from the EPA's Enforcement and Compliance History Online for safe drinking water. Violations related to human health were counted for each state over the past five years, between 2019-2023. Using census data from July 2023, the violations per 100,000 people in each state and Washington, D.C., were calculated.\nRead more: Find the Right Tax-Advantaged Health Savings Account\nAfter ranking states according to their water quality violations, these regions came out on top:\nMeanwhile, those with the most health-related violations during this period were as follows:\nThe EPA warns that the total number of health-related violations does not necessarily equate to water quality.\n\"The data reported to the EPA consists of violations of Safe Drinking Water Act regulations,\" a spokesperson from the EPA told Newsweek. \"Compliance data reported to the EPA does not directly measure drinking water quality as this depends on violation type and other factors unique to each water system.\n\"EPA does not rank states based on violations reported to the Safe Drinking Water Information System, or SDWIS. It does use violation and other data reported to SDWIS to inform its oversight and enforcement efforts as well as provide assistance to primacy agencies where needed. Violation count should not be the only factor considered when measuring state performance; for example, a high violation count could mean there is a robust state oversight program.\"\nStates like Alaska and Wyoming also have relatively small populations for their size, meaning that there there could be more violations per person because there are simply fewer people. Indeed, if we look at absolute numbers, Texas has the highest total number of health-based drinking water violations, but also has the second highest population in the U.S., so more drinking water systems are needed and used (and therefore would have more violations due to the sheer quantity of water systems).\nIs there a health problem that's worrying you?

It will then have been swept to the south by the East Greenland Current, melting into smaller and smaller fragments as it goes. Some of the smallest chunks in the image may only be tens of feet across.\n\"The smaller the floes, the more 'wispy' the patterns,\" Walt Meier, a sea ice scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), said in a NASA Earth Observatory statement.\nWinds from the Greenland Ice Sheet then blow the fragments around, forming the spirals shown in the picture.\n\"With the thinning and breaking up of the ice, it becomes more easily pushed around by the winds and current,\" Meier said.\nThere are several types of sea ice, including first-year ice, which forms and melts within a single year, and multiyear ice, which survives through multiple summer melt seasons and is thicker and more resilient. The larger fragments seen in the picture likely formed along the coast near where they are currently seen, having not yet been broken up by the journey.\nRecently, less sea ice has been making its way out of the Arctic Ocean along this route due to the effects of climate change, which have made Arctic sea ice thinner.\n\"Historically, when more of the Arctic sea ice would survive the summer melt season, growing thicker and older, a larger volume of sea ice would be transported through the Fram Strait,\" Angela Bliss, a sea ice scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said in the NASA statement.\nThe extent and thickness of sea ice off Greenland have been declining over recent decades due to climate change, contributing to the overall reduction in Arctic sea ice. Rising temperatures are causing more rapid melting of sea ice, leading to longer ice-free periods in summer and delayed freezing in winter.\nThis reduced flow of sea ice past Greenland may impact ocean circulation patterns that rely on this annual movement, causing knock-on effects across the globe.\n\"Less ice and freshwater transport have big implications for ocean productivity, as well as warming upper ocean temperatures, in the region,\" said Bliss.\nDo you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?

        "content": "Scientists have made a breakthrough in our understanding of how memories form in the brain and how this process may be disrupted by not getting enough sleep.\nThe findings offer exciting insights into how our brains work and may lead to new targeted treatments to improve memory formation in the future.\nGetting enough sleep is essential for our mental and physical well-being. It helps us consolidate our memories and aids physical recovery, and not getting enough has been shown to contribute to heart disease, obesity, neurodegenerative disorders and depression.\nNow, new research suggests that not getting enough sleep might permanently disrupt the formation and retrieval of waking memories.\nThe neurons that make up the \"wires\" in our brains rarely act alone. Instead, they are highly interconnected and often fire together in rhythmic and repetitive patterns. One example of this rhythmic firing is known as the sharp-wave ripple, which is sort of like a \"stadium wave\" in your brain.\nPrevious research has shown that sharp-wave ripples in an area of the brain called the hippocampus play an important role in memory retrieval and consolidation. However, the impact of sleep deprivation on these brain patterns is less well understood.\nIn a new study, published in the journal Nature, researchers from the University of Michigan Medical School recorded brain activity in the hippocampus of seven rats as they explored mazes over the course of several weeks. Some animals were regularly disturbed during sleep while others were allowed to sleep freely.\nBoth groups of mice showed similar levels of sharp-wave ripple activity. In fact, they were actually slightly higher among the group of sleep-deprived rodents. But the firing of these ripples in the sleep-deprived group was weaker and less organized than the patterns observed in the brains of the well-rested rats.\nThe sleep-deprived rats were then given two days to recover and demonstrated improvements in strength and organization of the sharp-wave ripple activity. However, they were unable to reach the same levels of activity as the rats with normal sleep schedules. In other words, sleep deprivation permanently altered the rats' ability to process specific memories.\n\"The memories that are formed prior to sleep deprivation will not undergo the same memory processing as those before sleep,\" lead author Kamran Diba, told Newsweek. \"Other studies from ours have previously shown that such memories won't be remembered in the same way.\"\nThis study adds to a growing body of evidence that memories continue to be processed after they are experienced, and that sleep appears to play a really important role in this processing. So pulling an all-nighter to revise before a big exam might not be a very effective strategy.\nNot only does this research highlight the importance of sleep in memory formation, but the team hopes that their findings may inform future strategies to stave off memory decline.\n\"One possibility is that if we can identify interventions that confer resilience to reactivation and replay (i.e. allow them to fully rebound during the eventual recovery sleep after sleep loss) then we may be able to circumvent memory decline, at least in the short term,\" Diba said.\nThis mechanism may also go some way to explain the associations we see between sleep deprivation and cognitive decline. \"While we did not investigate the case of chronic sleep deprivation, diminished reactivation and replay indeed represent a potential mechanism for cognitive decline, though I think there will likely be other links in the chain (such as protein signaling and gene expression),\" Diba said.\nIs there a health issue that's worrying you?

        "content": "NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has uncovered an unprecedented collection of ancient supernovae.\nAstronomers announced that they found 10 times more of these stellar explosions than were previously known to have existed in the early days of the universe. Some of these 80-ish newly discovered supernovae exploded when the universe was only around 2 billion years old—the universe today is about 13.8 billion years old—making them some of the oldest ever found.\n\"Webb is a supernova discovery machine,\" Christa DeCoursey, a third-year graduate student at the Steward Observatory and the University of Arizona in Tucson, said in a NASA statement. \"The sheer number of detections plus the great distances to these supernovae are the two most exciting outcomes from our survey.\"\nSupernovae are enormous explosions that occur when a star dies. They send out huge amounts of energy as the star's core collapses in on itself when it runs out of fuel. These supernovae often leave behind black holes or neutron stars when the original star is large or white dwarfs for smaller stars.\nThe JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) astronomers found these new supernovae within a minuscule patch of sky, the equivalent of the thickness of a grain of rice held at arm's length.\n\"Because Webb is so sensitive, it's finding supernovae and other transients almost everywhere it's pointed,\" JADES team member Eiichi Egami, a research professor at the University of Arizona in Tucson, said in the statement. \"This is the first significant step toward more extensive surveys of supernovae with Webb.\"\nThe astronomers detected these ancient supernovas thanks to a phenomenon known as cosmological redshift, which is where the light from distant galaxies appears more red than it should be. This occurs because the universe is expanding, causing the space between galaxies to stretch. Light stretches in a way that makes it shift toward the red end of the spectrum—because red light has a longer wavelength than blue light—meaning that when astronomers observe light from distant galaxies, they see this redshift, which tells them that those galaxies are moving away from us due to the expansion of the universe.\n\"This is really our first sample of what the high-redshift universe looks like for transient science,\" Justin Pierel, a NASA Einstein Fellow at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, Maryland, said in the statement. \"We are trying to identify whether distant supernovae are fundamentally different from or very much like what we see in the nearby universe.\"\nThe JWST's discovery of these 80 new supernovae was revealed by astronomers from the JADES program in a press conference at the 244th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Madison, Wisconsin. Before the JWST was launched, only a few supernovae had been discovered to have a redshift value that corresponded to having existed when the universe was younger than around 3.3 billion years old\nOne of the newly discovered supernovae exploded when the universe was only 1.8 billion years old, making it the furthest and, therefore, oldest ever found.\nThe astronomers are particularly interested in types of supernovae known as Type Ia supernovae, which have a predictable intense brightness. This means that they can be used to calculate the expansion rate of the universe using redshift. In this recent finding, they discovered at least one Type Ia supernova from when the universe was 2.3 billion years old, making it the oldest known Type Ia supernova. This may help scientists study if the brightness of these supernovae changes with redshift, which would impact their ability to be reliable predictors of the universe's expansion rate.\nThese findings may also help astronomers study how supernovae in the early universe were different from those of today and how this might have affected the formation of early stars and planets.\n\"We're essentially opening a new window on the transient universe,\" STScI Fellow Matthew Siebert, lead of the spectroscopic analysis of the JADES supernovae, said in the statement. \"Historically, whenever we've done that, we've found extremely exciting things — things that we didn't expect.\"\nDo you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?

After the press conference for the fight was randomly canceled, news about the cancelation of the fight began to be rumored. Now, there is finally an answer.\nSadly, McGregor is not going to be fighting at UFC 303, and a new main event has been announced. Though many were clamoring to see the UFC superstar return, the new main event should excite many MMA fans.\nUFC President Dana White announced on hix X page that McGregor suffered an injury and cannot make the fight against Chandler. However, replacing the Irish star is a lightweight heavyweight bout between current champion Alex Pereira and Jiří Procházka.\nPereira is coming off a TKO win against Jamahal Hill, who was also slated to be on UFC 303. Procházka is also coming off a big TKO win of his own against Alexsander Rakic.\nThis will be the second time that Pereira and Procházka will face off against one another, as Pereira secured the lightweight championship back in Nov. 2023, after he won by TKO against Procházka. This is a huge fight on short notice, but it appears that both fighters could have been preparing to step in on short notice, which is why they are taking this fight.\nSpeaking of Hill, White also announced that he would not be fighting at UFC 303, as he suffered a knee injury. Hill was set to fight Carlos Ulberg. Ulberg is now set to face off against Anthony Smith, though the fight is not slated to be the co-main event any longer.\nThe new co-main event for UFC 303 will be a bout between Brian Ortega and Diego Lopes. Ortega is coming off a submission win against Yair Rodriguez, back in February. Lopes is currently on a three-win fight streak, most recently stopping Sodiq Yusuff with a TKO in April.\nLosing the McGregor fight is certainly going to make plenty of hopeful fans upset, but the new main event should be a great fight. Procházka has been attempting to work his way back to a title shot, and now he can seek his revenge against Pereira in two weeks time.\nHill and Ulberg was also slated to be a good fight, but throwing in Ortega and Lopes should make plenty of MMA fans happy.\n",

But the most interesting thing about it? Not one of the quarterbacks has a Super Bowl to his name.\nHere's the updated list:\nT-1. Trevor Lawrence, Jacksonville Jaguars, $55 million per year.\nT-1. Joe Burrow, Cincinnati Bengals, $55 million per year.\n3. Jared Goff, Detroit Lions, $53 million per year.\n4. Justin Herbert, Los Angeles Chargers, $52.5 million per year.\n5. Lamar Jackson, Baltimore Ravens, $52 million per year.\n6. Jalen Hurts, Philadelphia Eagles, $51 million per year.\nThree of these quarterbacks have appeared in Super Bowls — Burrow, Goff, and Hurts — but all three lost and haven't been back since. The other quarterbacks have experienced little to no postseason success.\nLawrence, the now highest-paid quarterback in the NFL, has one career postseason win in three seasons.\nBurrow, who's tied with Lawrence at the top, has five career playoff wins in four seasons.\nGoff, the oldest quarterback on this list, has five career playoff wins in eight seasons.\nHerbert, who's only played one playoff game in his career, has zero career postseason wins in four seasons and was a part of a 27-point blown lead against Lawrence and the Jags.\nJackson, a two-time MVP winner, has just two career playoff wins in six seasons.\nAnd Hurts, an MVP runner-up, has two career playoff wins in four seasons.\nSo, the six highest-paid quarterbacks in the NFL on a per-year basis have combined to play 29 seasons and win only 15 playoff games.\nHuh?\nWhile I understand it's difficult to find a franchise quarterback in the NFL, and I also understand it's even more difficult to win a Super Bowl, something's not adding up here.\nThere is nothing more important in sports than winning at the highest level, and for some reason, that isn't a leading factor in these massive extensions.\nOf course, these extensions are banking on future success. But at the same time, it's hard to build a winning team when a quarterback is getting paid more than $50 million a season — especially when that quarterback can't single-handedly take a team to the Super Bowl like Patrick Mahomes.\nThe pressure will be on Lawrence and the rest of these quarterbacks to perform over the next few seasons. If they can't perform, these contracts could turn into real albatrosses sooner rather than later.\nThe quarterbacks remembered as the greatest of all-time are measured not by their career earnings or regular season wins, but by the championship rings in their collection. The six highest-paid quarterbacks in today's NFL have none.\n",

Truex has been a full-time Cup driver since 2006 and won his only championship with Furniture Row Racing in 2017.\nThe Athletic, which was first to report the news Thursday, reports that Truex \"seriously mulled retirement for the past few years\" before reaching his decision. The Joe Gibbs Racing driver had been racing on a series of one-year contracts in recent years, leaving his future up in the air as a new generation emerged.\nAccording to Fox Sports' Bob Pockrass, \"JGR wanted an answer now as there are several drivers without contracts for 2025, and JGR didn't want to lose a chance to land a driver while waiting on a Truex decision.\"\nTruex came on the scene as the son of an unheralded professional racer from New Jersey who made 15 starts in the former Busch Series (now the Xfinity Series) from 1989-98.\nThe younger Truex earned two straight Busch Series championships in 2004-05, earning a full-time promotion to NASCAR's highest circuit in 2006. He took over the No. 1 car on a full-time basis for Dale Earnhardt, Inc. and garnered two top-five finishes on the year.\nTruex won the annual Cup race in Dover, Delaware in 2007 en route to 34 victories on the circuit — and counting. He enters Sunday's inaugural Iowa Corn 350 ranked No. 5, with a chance at contending for his second career championship.\nAfter the 2009 season, Truex left Earnhardt Ganassi Racing (the NASCAR successor to DEI) to drive the No. 56 Toyota Camry for Michael Waltrip. He moved to Furniture Row Racing in 2014 and would record a top-four finish with them in 2015.\nThe 2017 season was Truex's most dominant, and ended with a championship-clinching race at Miami. It was the peak of a career that will likely result in NASCAR Hall of Fame enshrinement once Truex is eligible two years after his retirement.\nTruex made his fourth Championship Four appearance in his first season with Gibbs' team in 2019. The following year saw him miss the Championship Four for the first time since 2016 and finish seventh, but he rebounded with a runner-up finish to Kyle Larson in 2021.\nTruex missed the playoffs again in 2022 but rebounded in 2023 to finish fifth in the final points standings.\nAccording to Pockrass, Stewart-Haas Racing driver Chase Briscoe is the top candidate to replace Truex in the No. 19 JGR Toyota Camry.\n",

You get this cake presented to you which is really good, but you're not allowed to eat it. And you have to watch everybody else eat it. So it's tough, for sure, but I know why I'm doing it.\nThe journey back to Formula 1 has been fraught with frustration and near-misses for Schumacher, who described it as an \"emotional rollercoaster.\" He continued:\n\"Frankly, the way I was two years ago has nothing to do with the person I am today. F1 has been a dream I've had since I was five years old and I'm not ready to let go of that dream, right?\n\"Sometimes you feel like you have a chance, then it actually never ends up happening because something else happens.

It's never been a secret, my goal is to be back on the grid.\n\"I've shown in multiple ways that I am capable of winning championships. It's just a matter of it fitting into somebody's schedule, does it fit into their plan?\"\nDespite the setbacks, Schumacher remains optimistic about showcasing his untapped potential. \"There's a lot which hasn't been seen yet, especially from a driving point of view,\" he stated confidently. His time at Haas, though marked by variable performances including top-ten finishes at the 2022 British and Austrian Grands Prix, provided valuable lessons that Schumacher is eager to apply in future endeavors.\nSchumacher's adaptability and self-awareness shine through as he contemplates the various roles a driver might hold within a team.\n\"I understand how I could have improved [at Haas], and there's a lot more to show from my side. It's all about, what do you want in your team right now? Do you want somebody who you can build a team around? Good for marketing? Purely shut up and drive? There are so many different types of drivers. As for me, I'm really hungry for it. I just need to keep performing in WEC, showing everybody what I can do. Then people will know what they get if they hire me, and hopefully I'll be able to prove to everybody that they made the wrong decision in not keeping me.\"\nAfter Alpine confirmed it is parting ways with current driver Esteban Ocon at the end of the year, Schumacher, along with reserve driver Jack Doohan, is considered as one of the favorites to join the French team in 2025.\n",

        "content": "The Jacksonville Jaguars have now made it known that they are happy with franchise quarterback Trevor Lawrence, as the team has agreed to terms on a record-tying contract extension with the signal caller.\nRead more: 49ers Agree to Record-Breaking Extension With Star RB Christian McCaffrey\nIan Rapoport reported the news about the extension, stating, \"The Jaguars have reached a deal with their star QB Trevor Lawrence. Sources says they are giving the former No. 1 pick a five-year extension worth $275M — $55M a year — with $200M guaranteed and $142M fully. Lawrence's agent Jay Courie of @mgcsports did the deal.\"\nWhat makes this deal impressive and record-tying is the $55 million a year places Lawrence at the top of the quarterback earners with Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow.\nBurrow had been the only quarterback that reached $55 million per year, with the next closest figure belonging to Detroit Lions quarterback Jared Goff, who makes $53 million per year.\nGoff and the Lions recently signed an extension in May, catapulting him to the second highest-earning spot in the NFL. Now, with Lawrence making as much as Burrow, Goff drops down to third.\nLawrence was drafted No. 1 overall in the 2021 NFL draft by the Jaguars with the hopes that he would become their long-awaited next franchise quarterback. Lawrence got off to a rocky start as he secured 3,641 yards, 12 touchdowns, 17 interceptions, 334 rushing yards, and two rushing touchdowns in his first season. Though he came under plenty of scrutiny, he still showcased elite talent.\nThe 2022 season was far better for Lawrence, as he passed for 4,113 yards, 25 touchdowns, eight interceptions, 291 rushing yards, and five rushing touchdowns. The bounce-back season led to Lawrence receiving his first and only Pro Bowl nod.\nIn 2023, Lawrence once again secured over 4,000 passing yards, amassing 4,016 yards, 21 touchdowns, 14 interceptions, 339 rushing yards, and four rushing touchdowns.\nIt appears the Jaguars organization can see the value of having Lawrence as part of their plan for the foreseeable future. The new five-year extension locks the young quarterback up through the 2028 season.\nLawrence is only 24 years old and is entering his fourth season in the NFL. Not many quarterbacks can say they threw for over 4,000 yards more than once, especially this early on in their career. He will need to clean up his interceptions moving forward, but this extension does make sense.\nDoes Lawrence deserve to be paid as much as Burrow? Well, that remains to be seen. But he has gotten better every season and the future is bright for him and this Jaguars team.\n",

        "content": "As a business leader, your mental health can sometimes take a backseat to deadlines and bottom lines. However, prioritizing your mental well-being is a critical component of resilience, which is necessary for sustainable success.\nTo help you maintain balance, the members of Newsweek Expert Forum share their tried-and-true strategies for prioritizing their mental health. From carving out tech-free time to getting regular exercise, these methods can support your overall well-being while you continue to lead effectively.\nOver the last 2.5 years, I've noticed how effective being outside in some capacity has helped to not only improve my mood but also give me clarity on things I've been thinking through. Make sure to actually schedule this time as well. This is important for leaders because it helps them show up more grounded in their decision-making and sets an example for their team. - André Blackman, True Search\nAs leaders, we all need to take care of our mental health so as not to drive others crazy. We all spend most of our days in front of screens, so we get disconnected from our bodies. Then, paradoxically, our minds start going around in circles. To restore my sanity, I prioritize movement breaks by going outside and connecting with real three-dimensional human beings, even when I feel time pressure. - Paula Oleska, Natural Intelligence Systems\nAs an entrepreneur, I've realized the importance of prioritizing my mental health and overall well-being. Simple things like exercise and taking time to relax help me stay focused and positive. I find that talking to my coach often helps me refocus on the balance between work and personal life. - Jason Hennessey, Hennessey Digital\nRest and downtime can help improve cognitive function and decision-making abilities. Leaders who take time to disconnect and recharge often return with clearer minds and fresh perspectives, which are crucial for strategic thinking and problem-solving. - Britton Bloch, Navy Federal\nEveryone needs to have a break from stress and spend time with family and friends. Work hard, but also play hard. No one can survive a 24/7 stressful environment for long periods because you lose effectiveness as a leader and as an employee. Avoid complications and addictions in life. Strive for a healthy balance of exercising, eating right and getting enough rest. - Zain Jaffer, Zain Ventures\nI practice strategic solitude and set intentional, dedicated and uninterrupted periods of tech-free reflection. It is a mindfulness approach that allows me to not only disconnect from the physical world but also recharge my cognitive resources. Other leaders can adopt this practice to enhance their decision making and maintain an empathetic leadership persona. - Dr. Kira Graves, Kira Graves Consulting\nTherapy and exercise have been my saving grace as a business owner and leader. Especially as I've gotten older, I realize the importance of taking care of my well-being. For me, these two things are life-saving tactics for maintaining good mental health. - Tammy Sons, Tn Nursery\nPractice excellent self-care and setting clear boundaries between your work and personal life. By fostering a healthy work-life balance, you recharge, maintain focus and make sound decisions. A clear mind leads to increased productivity, creativity and better overall leadership. In this way, taking care of our mental health positively impacts our teams and organizations. - Anna Yusim, MD, Yusim Psychiatry, Consulting & Executive Coaching\nI see every transition in my day as a chance to reset and clear away any internal \"clutter.\" In the past, I filled these moments with distractions, which hindered my ability to recharge in small, real-time bursts. However, by seizing these opportunities to pause and be present, I've enhanced my focus, worked more creatively and resisted the urge to multitask as the day continues to unfold. - Leah Marone, Corporate Wellness Consultant\nHow you start the day sets the tone for your whole day. Prioritize an activity that supports your mental health first thing in the morning, such as meditation, movement or journaling. Then, practice power pauses throughout the day. Taking a couple of deep breaths can help you reset in as little as 60 seconds. - Karen Mangia, The Engineered Innovation Group\nBusiness leaders must inspire others, and it is hard to do when we are exhausted. We must be conscious about taking a break, even when we have much to do. Whether it is just a walk or a weekend trip, we need time for ourselves. - Krisztina Veres, Veres Career Consulting\nAn essential part of leadership is the clarity that comes from prioritizing our mental health. By taking time to rest and reflect, we recharge our mental and physical batteries. Setting up space in our day for self-care creates the opportunity to re-energize so that we can operate at full capacity and make better decisions. This helps our well-being and the overall well-being of those around us. - Henry Kurkowski, eWireless\n",

        "content": "Tech teams are working harder than ever in today's technology-driven world. As with teams across any department, extra support is critical when the scope of the work expands.\nTo help, 12 Newsweek Expert Forum members offer their tips for boosting support geared specifically toward tech teams. Whether you're exploring continuous learning opportunities or improving collaboration tools, these strategies can help you enhance support for your tech teams and foster innovation.\nOne effective way for companies to better support their tech teams is by investing in ongoing training and development opportunities. Providing access to relevant courses, workshops and conferences keeps tech professionals updated on the latest trends and technologies. Creating a collaborative culture that fosters knowledge sharing among team members increases productivity and job satisfaction. - Jason Hennessey, Hennessey Digital\nOne way companies can support their tech teams is by being proactive with open communication and process updates. Often, tech teams are very siloed. It's important for companies to bring their greater technology teams into more strategy and higher-level conversations to bridge knowledge and understanding gaps between business and technology. This often leads to greater innovation. - Chloe Alpert, Enobl\nThe best way for companies to support tech teams is to be nimble in their approach to methodologies and be open to new ways of doing things. Oftentimes, new tech becomes available to help streamline operations and communications but is late to be adopted due to technophobia on the management side. Be willing to embrace new tech that is introduced when it's appropriate, even if it's unfamiliar. - Henry Kurkowski, eWireless\nTech companies can lean into the use of artificial intelligence tools for their employees. Instead of only instrumenting policies to avoid its use due to concerns over regulations and privacy, provide healthy, compliant parameters that enable your teams to learn how best to drive efficiency with AI. AI is as transformative as general availability was in the 1990s, and it's here to stay. - Sabina Pons, Growth Molecules\nEnsure that your tech teams are up to date with the latest training and developments they need to remain at the peak of their game. AI and blockchain are some of the new buzzwords. Decide if a new technology direction is for your company, then ensure that your teams are properly trained and certified in those. - Zain Jaffer, Zain Ventures\nI would propose innovation sabbaticals, which are more structured and periodic breaks that allow tech team members to explore personal projects or new technologies unrelated to their normal work endeavors. This initiative aims to blend professional development with psychological restoration. Inevitably, it leads to greater creativity while also ensuring individuals update their tech knowledge and skills. - Dr. Kira Graves, Kira Graves Consulting\nIt's important to be proactive and listen to your tech team to stay up-to-date with state-of-the-art methods for improvement. Our tech team excelled when we followed this approach years ago. - Tammy Sons, Tn Nursery\nIn today's technology-driven world, companies can better support their tech teams by encouraging continuous learning. Provide professional development opportunities. By investing in training programs, workshops and certifications, companies empower their tech teams to stay updated with the latest trends and technologies, fostering innovation and growth within the organization. - Anna Yusim, MD, Yusim Psychiatry, Consulting & Executive Coaching\nEncourage experimentation. Many tech teams enjoy tinkering. Having permission to experiment \"on the job\" provides a productive and fun counterpoint alongside the running of business activities. Experimentation also often builds a sense of camaraderie that pays dividends in other ways. - Karen Mangia, The Engineered Innovation Group\nRecognize and address the unhealthy habits prevalent in tech teams that can lead to burnout and disengagement, including excessive screen time. It's common for employees to become consumed by projects and deadlines, neglecting their well-being in the process. However, this all-or-nothing approach isn't sustainable. Companies need to encourage a workable balance between perseverance and recovery. - Leah Marone, Corporate Wellness Consultant\nTech teams need help dealing with non-tech people. Sometimes, it is hard for tech professionals to read the minds of non-tech colleagues. Investing in an \"interpreter,\" like a good project manager who can be the glue between the different teams, can be very useful to avoid misunderstandings and put less pressure on the tech team. - Krisztina Veres, Veres Career Consulting\nContinuous training can help address any existing skill gaps within the team. Prioritizing this will ensure that all members are proficient and can handle the demands of their projects effectively. - Britton Bloch, Navy Federal\n",

        "content": "Former President Donald Trump's guilty verdict could represent a blow to his presidential campaign.\nTrump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, faced trial in New York City on 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment allegedly made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg alleged the payment was meant to prevent her from speaking publicly about her claims of having an affair with the former president.\nOn Thursday, a jury handed down a guilty verdict on all 34 felony counts following the trial, which lasted more than a month throughout April and May, while several states held their primary nominating contests.\n\"This was a disgrace. This was a rigged trial by a conflicted judge who was corrupt,\" Trump said outside the courtroom following the verdict.\nTrump, who has long denounced the prosecution as a \"witch hunt,\" has said he is innocent of all charges in this case and other criminal and civil cases he is facing.\nSentencing is scheduled for 10:00 a.m. on July 11, just four days before the Republican National Convention.\nTammy Vigil, a senior associate dean at Boston University's College of Communication, told Newsweek that the verdict will complicate his campaign.\n\"This might result in increased motivation to turn out to make sure the nation does not elect a convicted felon to the presidency,\" she said.\nStill, he is likely to continue to \"protest his innocence\" and may even fundraise off of the verdict, she said. His most ardent supporters are likely to continue supporting him, regardless of the verdict.\nGrant Davis Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University, said that undecided voters may have \"pause\" before voting for Trump due to the guilty verdict while they weigh other factors and concerns.\nHe said that the effect may be marginal, limited to only true undecided voters, but that that could still matter due to the close nature of the election.\nThe guilty verdict could have negative consequences for his presidential campaign, according to some polls.\nTrump has held a narrow, yet consistent, polling lead over President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, for months. But the verdict may convince some voters currently backing Trump to instead vote for Biden in November, according to polls.\nA Marquette Law School poll, conducted among 902 registered voters nationwide from May 6 to 15, found that a significant number of voters would abandon Trump in the case of a guilty verdict.\nThe poll found that in a scenario where Trump was found guilty, 43 percent of respondents backed Biden, while 39 percent said they would vote for Trump. But when asked who they would vote for if Trump were found not guilty, 44 percent said they would vote for Trump, and 38 percent said they would vote for Biden.\nThe poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.6 percentage points.\nMeanwhile, an ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted from April 25 to 30 found that 1 in 5 Trump supporters would reconsider or withdraw their support for Trump in the case of a guilty verdict. The sample size of the subgroup of Trump supporters was 937 adults with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4.\nNotably, he still faces three other criminal trials. Department of Justice (DOJ) Special Prosecutor Jack Smith has led two investigations, one of which focuses on alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and the other deals with classified documents found at Trump's Mar-a-Lago property in Florida.\nMeanwhile, Trump is also expected to eventually face trial in Fulton County District Attorney's investigation into alleged attempts at election interference in Georgia, a swing state that backed Biden in 2020.\nHowever, it remains unclear whether any of these trials will be held before the presidential election in November, as all have faced delays in recent months. Trump has pleaded not guilty to charges in each of those cases.\n",

Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee in the November presidential election, denies that he had sexual encounters with Daniels and pled not guilty to all 34 felony counts in the case brought by Bragg. On Thursday afternoon, a jury of 12 found Trump guilty on all counts.\nNewsweek senior reporter Katherine Fung was also inside the courtroom throughout the trial.\nIn his news conference, Bragg said, \"First and foremost, I want to thank the jury for its service. Jurors perform a fundamental civic duty. Their service is literally the cornerstone of our judicial system.\"\nContinuing, \"We should all be thankful for the careful attention that this jury paid to the evidence and the law and their time and commitment over these past several weeks.\" Bragg then recapped the trial, noting the evidence presented to the jury. He also thanked his prosecution team, calling them \"model public servants.\"\nBragg also said when answering a question from the media in part, \"The only voice that matters is the voice of the jury, and the jury has spoken.\"\nNewsweek has reached out to Donald Trump's campaign and the Manhattan District Attorney's Office via email Thursday night for additional comment.\nAfter the verdict was reached, Bragg took to X, formerly Twitter, saying, \"Today, a jury found Donald J. Trump GUILTY on ALL 34 felony counts.\" In a statement posted online Bragg also said in part, \"In Manhattan, we follow the facts without fear or favor and have a solemn responsibility to ensure equal justice under the law regardless of the background, wealth or power of the accused. The integrity of our judicial system depends on upholding that principle.\"\nPalm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg told Newsweek Thursday night, \"Bragg's prosecutors put on an excellent case by building a firewall around Michael Cohen with lots of corroboration. The defense struggled to provide a competing theory that could pass the smell test. It just wasn't plausible that Michael Cohen would go rogue and shell out $130,000 to protect his boss without Trump knowing or reimbursing him for it.\"\nFormer US Attorney and legal analyst Barbara McQuade also told Newsweek, \"The prosecution presented a strong case, and it is gratifying to see a jury confirm that no one is more powerful than the rule of law.\"\nMcQuade added: \"I would be surprised to see Donald Trump receive a custodial prison sentence in this case, in light of his lack of a criminal history in a non-violent offense, but now that he has some criminal history, a custodial sentence becomes more likely for any subsequent conviction.\"\nMeanwhile, Trump supporters took to social media to condemn the verdict. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican said on X, \"I'll be voting for President Trump on November 5th whether he is a free man or a prisoner of the Biden regime. My support for President Trump has never been stronger! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\nDonald Trump Jr. also posted to X saying, \"Guilty on all counts. The Democrats have succeeded in their years long attempt to turn America into a third-world sh******. November 5 is our last chance to save it.\"\nUpdate 11:05 p.m. ET 5/30/24: This story was updated with Barbara McQuade's comment.\n",

        "content": "U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts has refused a request from Senate Democrats to discuss fellow conservative Justice Samuel Alito's failure to recuse himself from cases involving former President Donald Trump.\nAlito has been under fire in recent weeks over two flags associated with Trump and the January 6 Capitol riot that had been flown at his homes. He blamed his wife for raising the flags and insists that he is unbiased in matters involving the ex-president—such as Trump v. United States, the pending case on Trump's claim that he is immune to criminal charges due to presidential immunity.\nDemocratic Senators Dick Durbin and Sheldon Whitehouse sent Roberts a letter last week urging him to \"immediately take appropriate steps to ensure that Justice Alito will recuse himself\" from cases related to Trump and to meet \"as soon as possible \"to address the Supreme Court's ethics crisis.\" Alito sent the senators his own letter on Wednesday, writing that no \"reasonable\" person would question his impartiality.\nRoberts replied to Durbin and Whitehouse in a letter on Thursday. He declined the senators' request for a meeting, citing \"separation of powers concerns and the importance of preserving judicial independence counsel against such appearances\" and reaffirming Alito's right to decide his own \"recusal issues.\"\nThe response quickly sparked fury from some on social media, inspiring accusations of \"corruption\" by Roberts and demands that Senate Democrats take further action.\n\"John Roberts, again, has already spoken about Alito's ethical failures. And Roberts is IN FAVOR of the corruption, not against it,\" lawyer Elie Mystal wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\"Roberts is every bit as bad as Alito and [Supreme Court Justice Clarence] Thomas,\" wrote political analyst David Rothkopf. \"He is an utter failure as a Chief Justice.\"\n\"BREAKING: Chief \"justice\" John Roberts DECLINES the meeting request from @SenatorDurbin and @SenWhitehouse, and says it's up to Alito whether he recuses (he said he won't). Can we subpoena them now? Or are we gonna write more letters?\" wrote Allison Gill of the Mueller, She Wrote podcast.\n\"Senate democrats need to act,\" political commentator Molly Jong-Fast wrote.\nNewsweek reached out for comment to a Supreme Court spokesperson via email on Thursday.\nDurbin responded to Roberts' refusal with his own X post on Thursday, promising that Senate Democrats would continue an \"investigation\" into alleged Supreme Court ethics issues.\n\"Let's be clear: Chief Justice Roberts could establish an enforceable code of conduct today... if he wanted to,\" wrote Durbin. \"But, he's refused. So long as he does, we will continue our investigation and pursue an enforceable code of conduct.\"\nOn Wednesday, Trump praised Alito for refusing to recuse himself over the flags—which are associated with the post-2020 election \"Stop the Steal\" movement and conservative Christian nationalism—writing on Truth Social that the justice displayed the \"guts\" and \"grit\" required to combat President Joe Biden.\n",

        "content": "With the news of former President Donald Trump's conviction in a New York trial, the nation has made a milestone out of a mickey mouse moment. A former president has not only been put on trial, he has been convicted of 34 felonies. Unfortunately, the convictions arise from the fetid fallout of a hush money payment to a porn star.\nOf course, key underlying events in this case occurred prior to Trump's presidency, but the prospect of a president paying in court for his misdeeds is unprecedented. It is both something to be proud of and, in more than one way, something to be ashamed of.\nTrump's conviction is something to be proud of because it affirms a fundamental American value—no one in this country is above the law. Trump seems to have lived his life thinking that the rules constraining ordinary mortals don't apply to him. His life has been soaked with scandals from which he, until recently, has walked away.\nHe has repeatedly been accused of cheating contractors, students at his unaccredited Trump University, donors to his charity, the Internal Revenue Service, and campaign donors. The public has watched as he made his way through serial failed enterprises to find genuine success on reality TV and to win the presidency. He was then accused of abusing that office in numerous ways ranging from subsidizing his hotels with government and foreign funds to advertising his wife's jewelry line on the White House website.\nBut now a reckoning has come in New York, the longtime base of his enterprises. He has been found by courts there to have engaged in fraud, rape, and repeated contempts of court. His current fortune has been found to have been buttressed by loan-inducing frauds and, most recently, a projected $100 million in double-dipped tax deductions.\nSo yes, we should be proud to see the claims against Trump decided in court by the rules that rightly apply to all of us. The United States can't run a credible justice system without hearing and deciding claims against the rich and powerful as well as the merely ordinary.\nBut this is where we can start talking about why we should be ashamed. We should be ashamed that the Trump legal saga has lowered the legal system in the minds of the American public. Partisan attacks from the left and the right on judges and prosecutors have shaken our system. Donald Trump has been particularly egregious in telling Americans that his trials are being secretly masterminded by President Joe Biden and his \"gestapo\" while unintentionally undercutting his claims by labelling Biden totally incompetent. If Biden were nefariously manipulating American law enforcement, Trump would be in jail and Biden's son would not be facing charges for misstating his drug use on a firearm permit application.\nBut now for the greatest shame. Maybe some of Trump's transgressions, taken in isolation, shouldn't have been singled out by busy prosecutors. Indeed, the hush money trial and its connection to campaign events was a shabby way to begin criminally prosecting a former president. It centered on a bookkeeping issue. Uncharged campaign and tax violations. Low comedy. It was not the kind of democracy-rattling drama it should take to put a president in prison.\nYet there is a democracy-rattling drama pending, and the greatest shame of the hush money case it that it has distracted attention from it. Trump is accused of attempting to overthrow an election with fraud claims found bogus in 60 court cases, some in front of judges he appointed. Worse, he is accused of hurling an angry mob at the Capitol of the United States. These charges have yet to get near trial.\nThe Justice Department should have leaped into action on these claims, yet it crawled. The major federal cases should have been brought, tried, and over long before the eve of a presidential election. Yet the major federal case is cooling its heels waiting while the Supreme Court issues other opinions but does not rule on whether the president is immune from criminal prosecution. These delays should cease, and the key cases should be tried. The cartoon is over. It's time for the drama to begin.\nThomas G. Moukawsher is a former Connecticut complex litigation judge and a former co-chair of the American Bar Association Committee on Employee Benefits. He is the author of the new book,The Common Flaw: Needless Complexity in the Courts and 50 Ways to Reduce It.\nThe views expressed in this article are the writer's own.\n",

Residents in Punta Gorda experienced heat into the triple digits, with highs reaching 101 degrees. The NWS said that the last daily heat record for the city in Southwest Florida was set on May 30, 2000, at 97 degrees.\nA daily high temperature was also set in St. Pete at 96 degrees Thursday. Fort Myers tied its daily high at 97.\n\"This is literally about as hot as we can get!\" Paul Dellegatto, chief meteorologist at WTVT in Tampa, wrote in a post to X (formerly Twitter). Dellegatto also shared a map that showed the high temperatures experienced throughout southern and central Florida on Thursday.\nFlorida residents got their first taste of the summer season over the past week, and record temperatures were set throughout the state. On Wednesday, Winter Haven broke its daily record at 99 degrees, as did Brooksville with a daily high of 97.\nSeveral daily highs were reached over Memorial Day weekend as well. Miami broke its temperature record on Sunday at 96 degrees, as did Orlando at 97 and West Palm Beach at 95. Large parts of Texas also grappled with heat this week, with several cities facing heat indexes well over 100 on Wednesday.\nTemperatures were in the mid-60s to 70s Thursday night in the Tampa Bay area, according to NWS. A chance of rain was also moving into southwestern Florida on Friday, with a 50 percent chance in Tampa and Sarasota. Highs on Friday are projected to be in the 90s.\nScattered showers are also possible in South Florida on Friday. The NWS has issued a hazardous weather outlook for the bottom of the Florida peninsula through Wednesday, warning that rainy weather moving into the area could produce \"lightning, gusty winds, and locally heavy rainfall.\"\n\"The strongest activity could produce small hail and a few locally strong to severe wind gusts,\" the NWS said.\nThe risk of a rip current will also increase over the east coast into the weekend, and hazardous \"marine conditions\" are possible in the Atlantic coastline on Sunday, read the warning.\nThe counties under the hazardous outlook include Palm Beach, Collier, Broward and Miami-Dade.\nThe Farmer's Almanac's 12-month outlook for Florida predicted an overly wet May, followed by a dryer than normal June with a fairly average July and August, albeit a little on the dry side both months and a little hotter in July than normal.\n",

        "content": "Even when you know it's coming, even when you know a successful appeal is likely, even when there is fair analysis that a conviction may be a net positive for former President Donald Trump's chances in November, Thursday's guilty verdict in a Manhattan courtroom on 34 counts is still a sad new low for an American justice system that is supposedly based on facts, evidence, judges who preside fairly, and juries that decide coherently.\nThose standards lie in ruins at the feet of the metaphoric image of Lady Justice, the famous figure seated holding a scale and wearing a blindfold. The scale represents the necessity of weighing evidence objectively. That did not happen in Trump's case. The blindfold represents a system that treats citizens without regard for who appears before it. That means no benefit for the rich or powerful, no disadvantage for any marginalized class.\nTrump represented a singular combination of a wealthy, powerful defendant who nonetheless represented an aggrieved figure in the forum of a New York courtroom. It was not a glib take to say he could not get a fair trial on the island of Manhattan. Every dark suspicion held by skeptics has been confirmed. The fix was in.\nI will leave to others the task of detailing the procedural outrages that should lead to a successful appeal. The bones of that challenge will involve a biased judge lording over a trial on artificially concocted crimes, featuring testimony from some witnesses who trafficked in irrelevancies and other testimony disallowed because it would have brought helpful clarity.\nA different type of clarity now settles over a troubled America. Our institutions are collapsing before our eyes. Our courts used to be venerable halls of reliable justice. Real crimes used to be prosecuted. District attorneys used to avoid targeting people in political vendettas.\nIt is of only middling comfort that the appeal may someday fix this. This should never have happened. And I don't mean the conviction; I mean the trial itself. The sparsity of the charges aside, consider for a moment that a former president of the United States was dragged into a dank New York court building because his enemies sought to ruin him for how an expenditure was characterized in a legal matter.\nIn a larger sense, the true motivation is far more ominous. Trump is being punished for the crime of beating Hillary Clinton and the anticipation of repeat offender status when he beats Joe Biden.\nThe system whose corruptions Trump has long identified seeks to cripple him because its denizens know his return to the White House is a direct threat to its power and influence. That system is looking to destroy him politically, financially and personally.\nHe has known this from the outset. He emerged from court Thursday defiant: \"This was a rigged and disgraceful trial,\" he proclaimed into the cameras and microphones in the courthouse lobby that have marked his arrivals and departures for six weeks. \"The real verdict will come November fifth.\"\n\"I am fighting for our country and our Constitution,\" he continued. \"We will fight to the end and we will win. Our country is going to hell.\"\nHow deeply does that sentiment resonate now among the jurors who matter most—the voters? A felony conviction is normally never a candidate's favorite development, but nothing about this is normal. Americans who despise Trump are not more numerous as a result of his verdict; they are simply happier. The voting bloc that may grow could be defined as those who have been wobbly on him up to now but who are repelled by the sight of his persecution at the hands of a system weaponized to block his return to the White House.\nThis is election interference on steroids, and it's not only MAGA Nation that will seek to respond.\nThat response will come in November. If it were today, Trump would win in a landslide. For every timid soul suddenly concluding that Biden isn't so bad because of what twelve jurors say about Trump, there may be several more declaring that this cannot stand. His campaign should be scouting NASCAR tracks for his next rally, because conventional arenas will not suffice.\nThe question is whether those passions can sustain for four months. The path to November features stops on a debate stage June 27 and a Republican convention three weeks later. Plopped between those dates is the expected sentencing July 11. Each of those moments provides an opportunity for Trump to remind the nation of what has been done to him.\nSome Americans seeking to protest this spectacle have just become Trump voters. Their power, combined with the millions who have been with him for years, may yet overturn this verdict with a force and finality that would dwarf any appeals court.\nA Trump victory will repair this injustice, but it will not erase it. No one should forget that it happened. Tinhorn political hacks in DA offices all over America are already energized in search of the big fish of their dreams. While the court of public opinion will rule on Trump's fate on November 5, a broader public outcry will be needed to prevent this from ever happening again—to anyone.\nMark Davis is a syndicated talk show host for the Salem Media Group on 660AM The Answer in Dallas-Ft.

The two nations signed a security agreement this week that includes supplying a total of 30 of the U.S.-built fighter jets to Ukraine to ramp up its defenses amid the ongoing war launched by Russia.\n\"They are trying to tell us that the United States and NATO would stop at nothing in Ukraine,\" Lavrov said. \"Nevertheless, we hope that the Russian-Belarusian drills on the use of non-strategic nuclear weapons that are underway now will knock some sense into our opponents by reminding them about the catastrophic consequences of further nuclear escalation.\"\nLavrov added: \"These aircraft will be destroyed, like other types of weapons supplied by NATO countries to Ukraine.\"\nNewsweek has contacted Russia's Defense Ministry for comment by email.\nBelgium vowed to supply Ukraine with all 30 F-16s before 2028. Last year, Belgium, alongside Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands, announced that it would be sending Ukraine an unspecified number of the aircraft.\nBelgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said at a press briefing with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday that his country would provide Ukraine with the F-16 jets \"as soon as possible.\"\n\"Our aim is to be able to provide first aircraft before the end of this year, 2024,\" he said. \"We will do everything in our capacity to deliver some planes already this year.\"\nHowever, De Croo said the U.S.-made jets are only to be used within Ukrainian territory.\n\"Everything which is covered by this agreement is very clear: it is for utilization by the Ukrainian defense forces on Ukraine territory,\" he said.\nThere has been a growing chorus of calls for Ukraine to be authorized to use Western weapons to attack targets inside Russia, more than two years into the war launched by Moscow in February 2022.\n\"Putin has only one influence mechanism, that is the destruction of life. He is not capable of anything else,\" Zelensky said Tuesday. \"A sufficient power of weaponry is crucial so that we can physically defend [ourselves] against Russia's terror.\"\n\"They are shooting at you, and you cannot shoot back at them because you do not have the permission [from Western allies],\" he added.\n",

It said Russia lost 22 armored personnel vehicles in the past day, bringing the total number to 14,913.\nBoth Moscow and Kyiv have lost significant amounts of personnel and equipment amid a recent ramped up push by Russia in Ukraine's east to seize territory. Kyiv said this month it had stabilized the situation on the front line after the Kremlin's forces kick-started an offensive in the Kharkiv region on May 10, seizing a number of villages on Ukraine's northeastern frontier.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has claimed that Russian losses during its Kharkiv offensive were eight times higher than Ukraine's. Newsweek could not independently verify the claim.\nThe General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces also said Russia lost 1,160 soldiers over the past day, bringing the total to 506,260. Moscow has also lost a total of 7,710 tanks, 13,101 artillery systems, 17,849 vehicles and fuel tanks, 815 anti-aircraft warfare systems, 2,222 cruise missiles, 357 military jets, 326 helicopters, and 27 warships in the war, the update said.\nNewsweek could not independently verify Kyiv's figures and has contacted Russia's Defense Ministry for comment via email.\nEstimates of casualty numbers vary, with the figures offered by Ukraine usually exceeding those of its Western allies. Moscow rarely shares information on the number of its own casualties.\nKyiv similarly does not provide updated information on its own casualties. A U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency assessment leaked in April 2023 said that Ukraine had suffered 124,500 to 131,000 casualties, including 15,500 to 17,500 dead.\nRussia's Defense Ministry said in its latest update on Wednesday that its military has so far destroyed 605 Ukrainian aircraft, 274 helicopters, 24,770 unmanned aerial vehicles, 524 anti-aircraft missile systems, 16,191 tanks and other armored combat vehicles, 1,322 combat vehicles of multiple launch rocket systems, 9,930 pieces of field artillery and mortars, as well as 22,093 units of special military vehicles.\nOn May 24, Zelensky told reporters that Russia's offensive in the Kharkiv direction led to \"military casualties of one to eight—one Ukrainian to eight Russians.\"\nUkraine's Security Service (SBU) claimed on Wednesday to have intercepted a phone call between a Russian soldier in the Kharkiv region and his mother, during which he complained about battlefield conditions and constant attacks by Ukrainian drones.\n\"We're hiding now, f*** it. I read all the f****** prayers... Mom, people here have been sitting without water for nine days. They drink their own urine.

Several of Ukraine's European NATO allies, such as Sweden and Belgium, have recently committed to sending more aid to Kyiv.\n\"Every decision to which we, then later everyone together, comes to is late by around one year,\" Zelensky said. \"But it is what it is: one big step forward, but before that two steps back. So we need to change the paradigm a little bit.\"\nZelensky also said that the Ukrainian Air Force, which has relied on an aging fleet of Soviet-era MiG aircraft during the war, needed allies to supply around 130 U.S.-made F-16s to counter Russia's air superiority.\nWhile several European NATO nations have pledged to give Ukraine a far smaller number of jets, deliveries have repeatedly been delayed, prompting some experts to question the effectiveness of the aid.\nWilliam Reno, professor and chair of the political science department at Northwestern University, told Newsweek earlier this month that delivery of the jets was unlikely to come at the \"optimal time,\" drawing a parallel with Kyiv receiving Western tanks after its fall 2022 counteroffensive.\n\"There's a tendency for weapon systems to arrive after the point at which they would have been most effective,\" said Reno. \"There was an optimal time for tanks... They were put to use when they arrived in 2023, but by then began to encounter drone attacks that exploited vulnerabilities in their armor and thus limited their utility.\"\n\"F-16s encounter a similar situation,\" he added. \"The length of the decision, training and delivery process have given Russian forces time to adapt air defenses, particularly as both sides settled into defensive positions.\"\nUpdate 5/30/24, 10:48 p.m. ET: This article has been updated to include comments from a U.S. State Department spokesperson.\n",

NATO countries are eager to tamp down on the possibility of the violence spreading beyond the country's borders. When providing military aid and weapons to Ukraine they have been clear they are assisting Kyiv's defense against Moscow's forces, not being party to the war.\nHowever, this hasn't prevented the hostilities from becoming Europe's largest armed conflict since World War II.\nNATO nations have increasingly come out in favor of permitting Ukraine to use Western-supplied weapons systems to strike into internationally-recognized Russian territory. The U.S., the most vocal opponent of Western weapons reaching beyond Ukraine's borders, has indicated this week it may \"adapt and adjust\" its policies, but has not yet lifted its restrictions on Kyiv.\nEarlier this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin said NATO countries, \"especially the ones based in Europe, particularly in small European countries, should be fully aware of what is at stake\" by allowing Ukraine to strike inside Russia with donated weapons.\n\"They should keep in mind that theirs are small and densely populated countries, which is a factor to reckon with before they start talking about striking deep into the Russian territory,\" the Russian leader said. \"This constant escalation can lead to serious consequences.\"\n\"It is another step toward a serious conflict in Europe, toward a global conflict,\" Putin said, adding long-range strikes from Ukraine were impossible without NATO-facilitated space reconnaissance.\nRussia's leader issued a \"completely unambiguous ultimatum\" with his remarks, a writer for Russia's Moskovskij Komsomolets daily newspaper claimed, adding they hoped Western countries would \"not think that he is bluffing.\" The piece also appeared on the front page of the newspaper's print edition.\nShortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Kyiv warned that, should Ukraine fall to Russian forces, other nations in Europe will be next on Russia's hit list in what would be a wider European war.\n\"If Ukraine will not stand, Europe will not stand,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said. \"If we will fall, you will fall.\"\nEarlier this year, Putin said \"everything is possible\" when discussing whether a wider war could break out between Russia and Western countries backing Ukraine. The globe is \"one step away from a full-scale World War III,\" Putin said in mid-March.\nThe previous month, Belarus' leader Alexander Lukashenko—one of Putin's most steadfast allies—warned that the world \"has again come to the brink of the abyss.\"\n\"There are grounds for concern\" about a third world war, he added.\n",

        "content": "A video has gone viral of Taylor Swift giving a shout-out to Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds' children during a night of the Eras Tour.\nSwift and Lively have been close friends since 2015, with the duo regularly supporting each other publicly. Lively directed Swift's \"I Bet You Think About Me\" music video in November 2021 and has attended numerous Eras Tour concerts.\nLively and Reynolds' oldest daughter, James, made her musical debut in Swift's song \"Gorgeous.\" The track was featured on the 2017 album reputation, with James lending her vocals to the track's intro. Swift also paid homage to three of Lively's children—James, Inez and Betty—in the track \"betty\" from her Folklore album.\nNow Swift has delighted fans by mentioning the three children again, this time during an Eras Tour concert in Madrid on Wednesday. The singer-songwriter has strayed from her regular schedule to perform two shows at Estadio Santiago Bernabéu in Spain.\nNewsweek emailed Swift and Lively's individual publicists for comment on Thursday.\nDuring her Folklore set, Swift mentioned the three young girls by name, which can be seen in a video uploaded to TikTok by user @musicsociety.\n\"I have to say that on Folklore some of my favorite characters are named James, Inez and Betty,\" the pop star said as the crowd screamed in excitement.\nAt the time of writing, the video had been viewed 701,200 times. People took to the comments to express how much they loved the special moment.\n\"The way she says betty is SO CUTE UGH I love her,\" one person commented.\n\"She's the best auntie,\" said another.\n\"IM CRYING OH MY GOD,\" a third added.\nLively had been spotted in the VIP area of Wednesday night's crowd with her three eldest daughters. She was also seen enjoying the show alongside sisters Alana, Este and Danielle Haim from the band HAIM.\nDespite Lively and Reynolds welcoming their fourth child in February 2023, the public remains unaware of both the name and sex. Reynolds previously joked about Swift's influence on the names of their children when he said he's \"waiting\" for the singer-songwriter to tell him the name of their fourth child.\n\"Taylor Swift keeps dropping [your kids' names] into lyrics, so just tell us this: Is the fourth child's name, the baby's name, anywhere on the new record?\" Today host Savannah Guthrie asked Reynolds on the May 13 episode.\n\"We always wait for Taylor to tell us what the child's name will be. And I'll say this, we're still waiting, so Taylor, let's maybe start [on that], you know,\" he joked. \"She's a prolific writer. I mean, what are we doing here? And lazy's not a word I'd attach to Taylor.\"\nFootage of Swift speaking Spanish at her concert in Madrid has gone viral on TikTok, with Swifties dubbing her a \"multi-lingual queen.\" During the gig at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, Swift told the crowd \"Bienvenido a la Eras Tour,\" which roughly translates to \"Welcome to the Eras Tour\" in English.\nA clip of the moment was shared to TikTok on Wednesday by user @jessicagolich, where it has received over 654,000 views in less than 24 hours.\nFollowing her arrival in Madrid on Wednesday, Swift was escorted from Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport to her hotel by an extensive motorcade. The fleet included several vehicles—complete with blacked-out windows to protect the \"Fortnight\" singer's privacy—with the drivers guided through the city by a motorcyclist upfront.\n",

        "content": "The British royals have been urged to come up with a plan to manage press and public expectations about Princess Kate's health and return to duties if her absence continues beyond the summer and into the fall.\n\"They're going to have to come back from the August break with a plan for how to manage public opinion,\" Newsweek's chief royal correspondent, Jack Royston, told a British news show on Wednesday.\nKate has not appeared at an official public event since Christmas Day amid her ongoing health issues, first with recovery from an abdominal surgery and then undergoing preventative chemotherapy following a cancer diagnosis.\nKensington Palace has maintained that no \"running commentary\" would be given about the princess' treatment and recovery, stating that she will return to her public duties only when her medical team has given her the green light to do so.\nThe last major update on Kate's health was given by the princess herself in her March 22 video statement announcing her cancer diagnosis. In the interim, Prince William has been asked about his wife's condition during public appearances. In May, he told well-wishers she was \"doing well.\"\nNow, as the monarchy heads into one of its busiest periods of the year without one of its star members, a British news show has heard that the institution needs to come up with a plan to keep public demand for information at bay if this continues into the fall.\nSky News anchor Kay Burley told Newsweek's Jack Royston that an information \"vacuum\" about Kate's health had started to rebuild, after a similar instance in February prior to the cancer announcement led to the spread of conspiracy theories and tabloid gossip.\n\"It's starting to emerge again but only at a low level, significantly lower than we were seeing in kind of late February and through March,\" Royston said, noting the need for preemptive action.\n\"I think they've got time. I think that they will survive until the autumn...the royals obviously go to Balmoral for the summer in August and they're going to have to come back from the August break with a plan for how to manage public opinion and how to manage the questions from the media as well.\"\nThe challenge, he explained, is that interest in Kate and her health extends beyond Britain. Polling for Newsweek conducted in May revealed that the princess is America's favorite royal, closely followed by Prince William.\n\"You have to remember that there's a big market in America and [this] can generate a huge audience on social media too so it's not enough just to have Britain under control,\" Royston noted.\nNewsweek approached Kensington Palace via email for comment.\nIn Britain, the news cycle is dominated by the upcoming general election, which will take place on July 4, taking some pressure off Kate, but her likely absence from showpiece royal events in the coming weeks could refocus attention on her health due to a public desire for updates.\nOn June 15, the annual Trooping the Colour military parade and Buckingham Palace balcony appearance—usually a showcase for Kate's celebrated style—by the senior royals are set to go ahead.\nJune 17 will be Garter Day at Windsor Castle which Kate, as wife to Prince William who is a Knight of the Order of the Garter, has traditionally attended.\nIn addition to this, the State Opening of Parliament is to take place on July 17. Kate could have been expected to attend in her role as Princess of Wales.\nMajor sports events like the Royal Ascot horse racing festival and Wimbledon Tennis Championships would also traditionally see Kate in attendance.\nIf Kate chooses to attend any event, it is not expected that it will be announced far in advance. Nor would it be expected to signify a complete return to public duties.\nAt the time of her cancer announcement, Kate said she was looking forward to returning to her work, but that for the time being she needed to focus on her health.\n\"We hope that you will understand that, as a family, we now need some time, space and privacy while I complete my treatment,\" she said.\n\"My work has always brought me a deep sense of joy and I look forward to being back when I am able, but for now I must focus on making a full recovery.\"\nJames Crawford-Smith is Newsweek's royal reporter based in London.

        "content": "Jerry Seinfeld is facing backlash online after saying he missed the \"dominant masculinity\" of 1960s America.\nTuesday, the comedian appeared on the Honestly With Bari Weiss podcast to promote his latest film, Unfrosted. Set in 1960s Michigan, the movie is loosely based on the real-life dispute between Pop-Tarts and Kellogg's to create a new favorite breakfast food.\nWeiss felt Unfrosted represented a \"sense of one conversation, a common culture.\" Seinfeld—who directed and starred in the film—agreed.\n\"That's part of what makes that moment attractive looking back,\" the 70-year-old said. He added: \"I always wanted to be a real man. I never made it, [but] in that era, it was JFK. It was Muhammad Ali. It was Sean Connery, Howard Cosell. You can go all the way down there. That's a real man.\"\n\"I miss a dominant masculinity,\" Seinfeld added. \"Yeah, I get the toxic thing. But still, I like a real man.\"\nIn April, the sitcom star sparked a similar uproar online following an interview with The New Yorker, in which he criticized the \"extreme left\" for what he saw as excessive political correctness, dubbing it \"PC crap.\"\nSeinfeld's interview with Weiss has gone viral, causing outrage on social media. One user on X, formerly Twitter, wrote, \"It's time someone took the mic away from Jerry.\"\n\"What a weird guy to bring this up,\" another user added.\n\"He's really embodying the 'old man shakes fist at clouds' persona now,\" a commenter wrote.\n\"Real men don't feel the need to be dominant or say things like this,\" another commented. \"They are secure in their masculinity.\"\nOther users supported Seinfeld's remarks, with one writing, \"I stand with Jerry.\"\n\"Jerry is spot on,\" another said.\nSome commenters felt the comedian's remarks had been taken out of context.\nAuthor Art Tavana wrote: \"He was mostly unserious and nostalgia-baiting. I think people just want to hate Jerry right now, and his choice to go on a political podcast isn't helping, but there you go; a bad PR move for a comedian who was (for a long time) mostly apolitical.\"\nIn the New Yorker interview, Seinfeld said excessive political correctness had led to a decline in the quality and availability of comedic TV shows.\n\"When you write a script and it goes into four or five different hands, committees, groups—'Here's our thought about this joke.' Well, that's the end of your comedy,\" Seinfeld said.​\nWhile conservative pundits and media outlets praised the 1990s icon for addressing what they saw as a significant cultural issue, others criticized Seinfeld for being out of touch.\nMany critics felt his comments overlooked external factors affecting the entertainment industry—including the recent writers' strike and the rise in streaming—as well as issues such as systematic racism and misogyny that \"woke\" diversity and inclusion policies attempt to fight.\n",

        "content": "Questions regarding Melania Trump's whereabouts have flooded social media, after the former first lady was not seen at court for the entirety of her husband Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial.\nAs the defense issued closing arguments at New York City's Manhattan Criminal Courthouse on Tuesday, three of the former president's five children were present and seated in the front row: Donald Jr., Eric and Tiffany Trump. However, as with the rest of the weeks-long trial, Melania Trump was nowhere to be seen.\nFormer The Apprentice star Donald Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in relation to so-called hush money he arranged for his then-lawyer, Michael Cohen, to pay Daniels to keep the alleged affair she had with the former president a secret ahead of the 2016 election.\nThe money was listed in Donald Trump's company records as \"legal fees,\" which prosecutors suggest was part of an unlawful attempt to influence the outcome of the 2016 race. Donald Trump admitted to reimbursing the $130,000 to Cohen, but has denied all accusations of wrongdoing, saying that the trial is part of a political witch hunt aimed at derailing his bid for another term in the White House.\nAs the trial rolled to its conclusion on Tuesday, video footage was shared of Donald Trump's family members standing outside the courthouse ahead of the day's proceedings. And while it was noted that he had three of his children on hand to join his team of supporters, questions were raised about Melania Trump.\nFormer NBC senior executive Mike Sington took to X, formerly Twitter, to share footage of Donald Trump being questioned as he entered the courthouse. As of press time, the video has garnered more than 400,000 views. Newsweek has contacted a representative of Donald Trump via email for comment.\nCaptioning the footage, Sington wrote: \"As Tiffany Trump, Eric Trump, Lara Trump and Don Jr stand behind Donald Trump at the courthouse today, reporter shouts the obvious question: 'Where's Melania?'\"\nAhead of closing arguments, One America News Network's Daniel Baldwin cited sources as informing him that \"Don Trump, Jr., Eric Trump, Lara Trump, Tiffany Trump, Michael Boulos, Steve Witkoff, Will Scharf, and Deroy Murdock will be at court today with President Trump.\"\n\"But where's Melania?\" an X user responded, echoing a flood of similarly worded messages that dominated the conversation on the micro-blogging platform.\nRon Filipkowski, a former federal prosecutor and frequent critic of Donald Trump, also joined in on the action, writing: \"Where's Melania?\"\nThe former first lady's absence from the trial spared her from listening to adult entertainer Daniels' testimony, during which she shared details of her alleged sexual encounter with Donald Trump. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, alleged that the encounter took place in 2006, one year after Melania Trump married the then real estate mogul.\nWhile she has been absent from the courtroom, Melania Trump has been photographed with her husband on occasion in recent months. The former model and her husband were on hand for their 18-year-old son Barron's high school graduation in Palm Beach, Florida, on May 17.\nOver the past several months, Melania Trump has largely shied away from making public appearances, a move that prompted questions as her husband ramped up his efforts to secure the Republican presidential nomination.\nMelania Trump's former friend and aide Stephanie Winston Wolkoff told CNN earlier in May that she did not believe the Slovenia native would attend the trial.\n\"Melania is Melania's own person,\" said Winston Wolkoff, who has been highly critical of Melania Trump in the years since their relationship soured. \"In regards, again, to a marriage that you want to consider to be something that most people are trying to still understand, don't. I do not see her supporting him this way.\"\n\"I think you can feel that humiliation without having to put yourself in front of the cameras,\" she added. \"Everything Melania does is staged.\"\nDonald Trump's eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, has also been notably absent from the courthouse during the trial, and has not publicly weighed in on the matter.\nHowever, a source familiar with the situation told Newsweek in April that Ivanka Trump—who served as a senior adviser to her father along with her husband, Jared Kushner, during his term in office—has been communicating with Donald Trump and \"remains as supportive as ever.\"\n",

        "content": "It was 2020 and, for some of us, the worst year of our lives. But, as the Disturbed song goes: \"Sometimes, darkness can show you the light\".\nWith all that unfolded around us during the COVID pandemic, I found myself at 500lbs and with a job that had me traveling from home to hotels to hospitals, even though most of the world was shut down.\nI had always been overweight from a young age. In fact, I can't remember a time when I wasn't. But this was the largest I had ever been. I wore a 6XL shirt—I'm large and tall, so it was more like a 7XL because they always ran big—and had a 64-inch waist.\nSo when I was home, I was stuck in my office frustrated, scared, and uncertain of what was next. I lost several friends to COVID, and working in hospitals fueled everything that was going on in my head.\nWas I next? Would I infect my family? I was frightened.\nMy wife urged us to go for a walk, suggesting that we stay away from other people and perhaps head into the woods. That is when I realized how out of shape I was.\nWe walked a block: I was out of breath, my back and feet hurt, and it was a struggle for me. My wife was in much better shape than me. We'd been married for 27 years at that point, and you get to know a person and what drives them.\nMy wife never allowed me to quit. Every day, she would ask: \"You want to go for a walk?\" If I said no, I'd feel like I let her down, so I never did.\nAmazingly, before I knew it, I'd lost 75lbs. It's a drop in the bucket when you weigh 500lbs, and I'd lost weight before only to gain it back. The last time I gained weight back, so I made a promise: If I ever lost weight again, I would never gain it back.\nI knew what I had to do, and walking seemed to be the thing that allowed me to lose weight. I am driven and competitive, and if you tell me I can't, I will prove otherwise. I'm sure my wife knows that too; she has helped me fuel that fire.\nI started walking everywhere. The only time I used my car was when I had to drive to the next hotel or hospital for work.\nThe funny thing about walking is it allows you to clear your mind, and it highlights the beauty around us. When you drive, you focus on what is ahead. But when you walk, you have the opportunity to see everything.\nWalking also allowed me to hold myself accountable with food. If I had a craving for a large steak and cheese extra greasy—I mean, what other way is there to have one?—I would walk a mile to the sub place, enjoy my meal, and walk back and not feel guilty.\nI called it accountability. There's nothing worse than trying to lose weight and having a craving, so I didn't ignore that craving, I fed it. But the accountability freed me from the remorse afterward that usually led to more eating. I'd earned it.\nThe only time I felt remorse was when I didn't walk, so I walked every day. I started with a block, then a mile, then two miles. And every day I would push myself further. The next thing I knew, it was 5km every day.\nThis led me to find new places to walk. I started walking in the woods, parks, trails. I even got an app to show me what was available no matter where I was. It was exciting; where will I discover next?\nI used to laugh when people would say they went for a walk in the woods. I would say: \"Why?\" I get it now.\nPerspective: that's a huge word for me and one that has changed the way I live and how I see the world. Until you put yourself in someone else's sneakers, you will never have the perspective on what makes them who they are and why they do the things they do.\nI took a job with a small startup that gave me the opportunity to travel the world. It was then I realized I had to document my journey of weight loss and personal growth, so I started the \"Walking the World\" group on Facebook.\nThe goal was to use the Facebook group to drive me forward and hold myself accountable. People around me started to notice what I was doing, and their support only drove me more. \"Hey I saw you walking, keep it up, looking good.....proud of you.\"\nI traveled to the Netherlands and walked from one end of the country to the other, from Groningen to Amsterdam and Rotterdam. I did 45,000 steps walking in Amsterdam alone one night. What an amazing city Amsterdam is, especially at night.\nThen I was off to Paris, France. I arrived at 9 a.m. but the hotel room wasn't ready so I walked to the Eiffel Tower and had a French roast coffee and a chocolate croissant. Again, accountability through walking and no regret—it was amazing.\nWalking back, I was able to catch Vice President Kamala Harris and her motorcade driving past me on her visit to the Institut Pasteur.\nNext stop was Lyon in France and the Parc de la Tête d'or and the amazing waterfront. Lyon is a beautiful city. With COVID restrictions ending, locals had set up restaurants on boats in the waterways for open seating. It was amazing to see how other countries handled the COVID crisis.\nThen I was in London, England when my first stop was Abbey Road. Music has always been a huge part of my life and I don't know if I could have accomplished any of this without it.\nAs I approached, I sang \"All You Need Is Love,\" only to have other people join in. It was when I realized the world around us has a soundtrack; if you listen closely, you will hear it. We all have our own soundtrack.\nThe day I hit my ideal weight and was approved to have all the extra skin taken from my abdomen, I celebrated like I only could: I hiked the Wishbone Trail from Carver to Plymouth in Massachusetts; 13 miles of every terrain possible.\nIt was like when you watch the final group on the TV show Survivor as they look back at the journey they had just traveled. It gave me strength and clarity. It spoke to me and said: If you want something bad enough and you never give up, you will accomplish it.\nI have walked all across the U.S. and Canada and made a trip to Manchester, England.\nI have put a map of the world on my office wall and every time I walk somewhere new I put a pin in. Someday, I will fill that map.\nI am often asked: How much weight did you lose and what is your weight now?\nI have lost over 217lbs so far, but the journey is ongoing. Along with the weight loss I am working to build muscle. When you lose that much weight you also lose muscle mass, so it's important to build that back as well. How much you weigh is important, but quality of life and the things you can do outweigh that number.\nMy doctor told me I have added 40lbs of muscle and that is not the norm, but my body type is not one of a small man. I am 6'1 with a 14 EEEE size shoe. At some point, it is less about the number and more about your health and all of the things I can do now that I have never been able to do before.\nDon't get me wrong: I still step on the scale. But the mirror and my doctor are better indicators of my progress now. This journey is ongoing and will be part of my everyday life. I moved to Philadelphia after living all of my life South of Boston.\nMy new adopted home has welcomed me and the people in the city of brotherly love have been amazing. I have a granddaughter and a grandson on the way here, and living here allows me to enjoy every moment with them. Having the stamina to keep up with them is glorious.\nMy daughter is getting married this year. I was asked to be the officiant for her wedding and I am working extra hard to look good, and I am going to dance the night away. There's always something new and exciting on this journey.\nI have made it my goal to empower others to never give up. I am not an influencer, I am an empowerer. I will never tell you what is right for you, I will only tell you that if you want something bad enough: Yes you can. It is never easy and the journey may be long, but if you never give up: Yes you can.\nThis journey did not happen overnight. You have to start somewhere. I started walking a block and eventually hiked 13 miles, but I never quit and never gave up. I have a lot of people to thank for that.\nAll of you who honked your horns as I walked around town, and who encouraged me to keep moving—thank you.\nA family friend who had not seen me in over a year almost rear-ended someone because he couldn't believe what he saw. Please keep your eyes on the road, and thank you.\nNow it's time for me to pay it back and that is why I wrote this. I want you to know, yes you can, just keep moving. Find your soundtrack and turn it up to 11 (Spinal Tap reference, FYI) because it's contagious.\nI am proof of that.\nTake a moment to listen to your soundtrack and that of the world around you. If you don't like what you hear, own it because only you can change it.\nEric Pupek is a husband, father and grandfather who changed his life one step at a time, walking the world.\nAll views expressed are the author's own.\n",

Bud was 21 and worked the night shift at the paper mill in Portage, Michigan, and attending college.\nWhile at the fair in Kalamazoo, Michigan, Margie and two other dancers befriended a boy who drove them in his yellow convertible to his friend Bud's house. The five of them talked, drank milk with ice cubes, and listened to Stan Keton's \"23 Degrees North and 83 Degrees West.\" Margie and Bud were smitten with each other.\nAt the end of the summer tour, Margie returned to Illinois to start her senior year in high school, and Bud continued to work and go to college.\nThey talked on the phone, wrote letters, and Bud drove 160 miles each way to visit Margie on the weekends.

My mom said she was immature and times were different back then. She wished she understood and could communicate her feelings better.\nHer parents and church had ingrained in her that a woman doesn't live with, or sleep with a man until they're married. And once you're married, a woman gives up her career ambitions and supports her husband, their children, and home.\nMy mom had just been offered a position managing a dance studio and her dream was to own it someday. She gave back the ring and broke Bud's heart.\nThey became strangers and moved on with their lives. He met another woman, and my mom married my biological father, who then died when I was three. Although he is listed as father on my birth certificate, I knew him only from pictures. I saw so little of him that when we moved in with my grandmother permanently, I was unaware that he passed away and I would never see him again.\nI didn't understand the hardships my mom went through during those years. My father had progressing kidney disease as a complication of juvenile diabetes, and she sheltered my siblings and I from all of it.\nWe often stayed with our grandmother while she sat at the hospital with him or tried to keep our home quiet and stress-free so he could rest. By then, she was running her dance studio out of the family room of her mother's house so she and my grandma could raise us and run a business.\nI loved playing in the dance studio—a big, empty room with mirrors lining the walls and a closet full of costumes. I vividly remember dressing up in oversized sequined leotards and skirts, trying on different costume hats, making faces in the mirrors, and twirling around. My cousins, siblings and I would roll out the long, black rubber mat and practice our headstands and somersaults. We'd put the mini tramp on the mat and run and jump for hours.\nOne day in first grade, my teacher instructed the class to address the letter we were working on to mom and dad, except me because I didn't have a dad. I could address mine to mom and grandma.\nFor the first time, I realized my family structure was different. I remember feeling special because of my unique situation but also that I was missing out because all the other kids had a dad.\nSo, when I was seven and my mom mentioned she was getting married, I was excited. I was going to have a real dad in my life this time. I was too young to notice they only had a three-month courtship or the arguments my mom and grandmother had about finances and trying to make ends meet.\nAll I knew was that I got to wear a pretty dress with a flower crown and my mom looked beautiful in her pink, dotted swiss dress and sausage curls around her face. And we were moving into a new house that my new dad built.\nUnfortunately, the thrill of having a new father was short-lived. Herb was good at getting up at the crack of dawn, putting roofs on houses, yelling in a loud, scary voice, and going to bed early.\nMy mom once again turned the family room into a dance studio to teach the neighborhood kids tap, jazz, ballet, and acrobatics, but now Herb would scold us for making too much noise, wasting our time playing, and not doing chores around the house.\nInstead of helping me develop my interests and personality, like the dad on Brady Bunch, Herb taught me to be quiet and disappear from a heated situation without anyone noticing.\nMy mom stayed married to Herb for 40 years until his verbal and emotional abuse dangerously affected her health. They had moved to a hobby farm in Wisconsin and Herb's physical and mental health were declining leaving her with all the farm work.\nThe doctors could not get her blood pressure under control and told her she had to make a drastic change or she was headed for a stroke and/or heart attack. She was 76 years old.\nThat same day, she told Herb she wanted a divorce. I was shocked at her uncharacteristic boldness. Although she complained about Herb over the years, she took great pride in her marital vows, and I never thought she'd leave him.\nShe asked me to set an appointment with a lawyer in her county to start the proceedings. After the meeting, she drove 300 miles south to my house. I knew she was frazzled by the whole situation when she arrived with her dog, Murray, in the passenger seat of her compact Ford pickup truck and the belongings she felt were important haphazardly thrown in the back cab. She began to cry when she realized she packed her purple boa and forgot her underwear and cash.\nWhile living at my house, I helped my mom set up a Facebook account and within weeks, fate stepped in, and Bud reentered our lives. It only took six months for Bud to propose to my mother a second time—with the same ring he picked out for her in 1954 on State Street in Chicago. He'd kept it all these years, amazingly.\nThis time, she said yes and meant it, and I saw a sparkle in her eye I'd never seen before.\nWhen my mother finally married the man I most consider my father I was a grown woman of 46, divorced and remarried with three kids of my own.\nMargie and Bud moved to Florida, bought a house, and had their wedding around the backyard pool. They were 77 and 81. During the ceremony, my mom danced a hula for Bud to The Hawaiian Wedding Song. Two of Bud's three adult children were in attendance, along with my sister and myself; the rest of their children were unable to attend.\nI was thankful I got to know Bud, my stepfather. He took a genuine interest in me and instantly welcomed me into his life and home. I think he automatically loved me because he loved my mom so deeply and that sincere emotion felt good—a comfort I had never felt from a platonic relationship before.\nOne day while I was visiting my mom and Bud, he randomly gave me a book, Many Lives, Many Masters by Brian Weiss, saying he thought I might like it.\n\"OK, thanks,\" I said. \"What do you like about this book?\"\n\"After reading it, I'm not afraid to die,\" he said. \"I just got a sense you'd like it.\"\nHe was right. The book about past lives and our purpose here on earth resonated with my beliefs. It felt nice to have an adult male figure take an interest and encourage something that was important to me, even as a grown woman.\nJust four years later, Bud died from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. My mom struggled with the nagging questions that tugged at her heart: What if?\nWhat if she didn't get cold feet back when she was 18 and give the ring back? What if she hadn't been intimidated by his worldly experiences of being in the army and working full-time? What if the culture was different and she could have had her dance studio and get married?\nWhat if he had been my father? I thought.\nI was in the house when he crossed over peacefully. I woke in the morning to find my mom sitting by the temporary hospital bed in the living room, holding his colorless hand. She said she just wanted to sit quietly with him one last time.\nThe little girl deep inside me had always ached for a father figure, and my mom had waited a lifetime for her soul mate. Even if we only had him for four short years, Bud had given us what we each needed, and for that I am forever grateful.\nThere's a saying that everything happens for a reason, but very often it's hard to understand the reasoning behind certain events.\nI'm the person I am today because of the decisions she made and those I made with the knowledge and experiences we had at the time. I've had a wonderful life but I'm still trying to heal the little girl who longed for a father to love her.\nMelania Murphy is a freelance writer specializing in a wide range of topics from parenting to gender equality to life after 50.

        "content": "\"You have brains and your brother has personality,\" Mom often said. Today's parenting experts wouldn't approve of her childrearing techniques, but her opinion wasn't far from the truth. Although my brother was intelligent, he didn't excel in school, whereas I was a straight-A Goody Two Shoes.\nOver the years, we grew apart as he moved from New York to Miami, and I started a new life in Toronto. We'd exchange the occasional phone call and we saw each other at weddings and family reunions.\nFour phone calls shattered this arrangement. The first: \"Your brother has had a seizure.\" He collapsed when the busy restaurant he managed was shuttered for renovations and they dismantled the bar. Apparently, alcohol withdrawal is dangerous. He went into a 28-day rehab and decided to leave the hospitality world's temptations. It turns out that his warm personality and quick wit were ideal for selling cars, which he excelled at, except when he went on a bender and didn't show up for work.\nThe second call: \"Sis, can you bail me out?\" He was in jail because he'd been found sleeping in his car with an open container of alcohol. After many phone calls and a bank transfer, he was released from the clink.\nThe third call: \"Your brother robbed a bank.\" It seems that a month earlier, he had successfully robbed a bank. Because it was so easy, he returned for a second go-round. The teller spotted him waiting in line wearing the same sunglasses and blazer from the previous crime. \"I only had one bank-robbing outfit,\" he quipped years later.\nClassified as a violent offender because of the 99-cent plastic pistol that never left his pocket, John was sentenced to 41 months in prison.\nWe called my brother Pepo after the neighborhood boys nicknamed him when he was 10. Now Pepo was languishing in a cell, surrounded, as he said, by \"assorted scumbags, murderers, rapists, bankers, lawyers and stockbrokers.\"\nWhat does a sibling do in this situation? If you're me, you write a letter. I was relieved to see a return envelope from him appear soon after. To keep his mind occupied, Pepo began penning stories of growing up in Astoria, Queens.\nHe described getting a job in a barber shop as a shoeshine boy at age 12 after our father abandoned the family and Mom sometimes didn't have grocery money. He wrote about the neighborhood kids and their shenanigans, playing stickball, and getting cuffed by the nuns at school.\nDelighted by his stories and his writing voice, I told him he possessed genuine creative talent. He didn't believe me: \"Oh, you're just being nice so the guards don't find me hanging off the bunk with the band from my boxers around my neck.\"\nSlowly, over five years in prison and halfway houses, my brother began to think of himself as a writer. He fantasized about getting his stories published. I encouraged this thinking because I thought his writing was solid, he had a funny and perceptive point of view, and because I didn't want him hanging off that top bunk.\nIntertwined with his growing-up reminiscences were his prison tales. At first, he didn't want to scare me by sharing stories about his cellmates, like Topo, who committed his first murder at age nine.\nMore than once, he told me he felt closer to me because of our flow of communication. In addition to the letters back and forth, there were phone calls, albeit one-way because one cannot call into a prison. We developed a more intimate relationship, sharing thoughts and feelings that would never have been revealed if he'd been living in the busy outside world.\nThe day he walked out of prison, he was sent to a halfway house and was fortunate to find a job in a warehouse with a boss who understood the conditions of ex-cons who had to check in with authorities, submit to frequent drug tests, and so on. Still, he was paid the lowest legal wage.\nI visited him twice in 2009 when he was back home in Miami. On that second visit, he was shaky. We held hands across a steakhouse table and wept. He feared violating his conditions by drinking. He couldn't bear being sent back to prison, a genuine possibility. He longed for the day when he would be truly free and could earn good money to support his family. But this was not to be.\nHere comes phone call number four: \"Pepo has passed away.\" In May 2010, he fell in his home and hit his head. We were devastated to lose him. All that potential, gone. He was only 52.\nI vowed to transcribe and edit his letters. Some were 16 pages, handwritten, on yellow legal paper in my brother's almost-illegible scrawl. Today, his stories have come to life in a book. By reading it, I hope his children and grandchildren will somehow feel closer to this beautiful, funny, broken man.\nDonna Papacosta is a mostly retired communications consultant and university instructor in Toronto, Canada.

        "content": "When I was young, a woman I knew got a tattoo of Bugs Bunny on her upper arm. I didn't know many women with tattoos back then and I'd never been a fan of Bugs. I wondered what would happen once her arms, then as firm and toned as Michelle Obama's, succumbed to age and gravity.\nOver the course of a few decades, I suspected the ink would fade, Bugs would become piebald as age spots appeared. That preadolescent prankster would become a portly provocateur. \"What's up Doc?\" would take on more somber undertones. Rabbits are not rodents, but it would be hard to tell the difference. How will she explain the fat rat on what remains of her deltoid?\nMy daughter, Lydia, started planning her tattoos when she was 13. The intricate drawing would be inked on the back of her slender neck. She might've shaved her head again to show it off, or kept it secret under a veil of hair—blue, purple, or natural soft brown with sun-kissed highlights. In Maryland, it was illegal to tattoo a minor so I didn't worry about it. It was a very nice design.\nWhen Lydia ended her life before she was old enough to get her coveted tattoo, my son Daniel, 12 years old, designed a memorial tattoo in her honor. He refined his original artwork and had it inked when he was 18, a freshman in college. It's quite large and colorful, although after two decades, not as vibrant as it once was.\nBy this time, many female friends had tattoos, ranging from a tiny wrist butterfly, a delicate rose above the breast, to a giant tramp stamp that lunged like a baleen whale out of the seat of tight, low-cut jeans.\nFascinating. I wanted to know all about every bit of body art I saw. It turns out, people are happy to tell their tattoo stories. Some are funny, many heartbreaking, all anthology-worthy.\nThinking about getting a tattoo of my own, I considered Lydia's name, maybe on my hip, because I'd carried her there when she was a baby. Not for long though—my independent child demanded to be put down, to do her earthly research untethered.\nI thought again of age and gravity, envisioning myself being turned and bathed by surly underpaid caregivers in a tight, ammonia-scented room. They'd see the name on my hip and assume I'm another old lesbian—maybe they'll laugh. We've all seen those videos of nursing home abuse. But, as usual, I digress.\nFor two decades, I never got around to getting that tattoo. But I've decided I want one and refuse to die before I get it. At 70, with a family history heavy with heart attack, stroke, and breast cancer, I figured it was time.\nI stopped at a red light and impulsivity struck like 220 volts. I typed tattoo into my GPS. There was a place 2.2 miles away. Lydia loved palindromes so I had no choice.\nMy tattoo idea was not unique. The tiny semicolon, sometimes enhanced with butterfly wings, cat whiskers, or musical notes has, like a team sweatshirt, has become the designated identification for membership in the club of people bereaved by suicide.\nThe Semicolon Project started in 2013 when Amy Bleuel's idea took root and the semicolon became the universal logo for mental health and suicide prevention. The tagline was \"Your story isn't over.\"\nMy tattoo artist proudly mansplained the use of the semicolon. He'd learned that using one in the first paragraph of any paper he wrote in college meant a guaranteed A. Such power wielded the little period-comma combo that it could stop a sentence from ending.\nAbout to be on the receiving end of the buzzing needle, I smiled. I didn't tell him what my desire to have one inked on my arm meant to me. Or that for many, it symbolizes the choice to continue living. A reminder of strength and perseverance. A signal to some that we are kindred.\nMonths after getting my tattoo, I sometimes startle catching a glimpse of it on my wrist. Seeing it upside down, it resembles a giant ant. Abdomen, thorax, antenna. Ever hypervigilant, I jump or swipe at it and I imagine how Lydia would be amused. Because although her life has ended, as long as I'm here to tell it, her story is not over. And neither is mine. I'm thinking about my next tattoo.\nEileen Vorbach Collins is an author and writer.

        "content": "\"N***** is just a word.\"\nThose five words were my piercing introduction to being an African American female teacher and graduate student in the field of composition pedagogy. Even now, more than two decades later, those five words remain a dominant memory of my experience earning my graduate degree in English.\nIt was a composition pedagogy and curriculum course for first-­year graduate students, and I was a proud and excited member of the cohort. We had received teaching assistantships as part of our graduate school funding package, and we were being trained to teach college-­level writing. The class was being team-taught by two instructors, one constructed as White female and the other constructed as White male.\nAt the time, the terminal degree offered by the university was in rhetoric and professional communication (RPC), and the RPC faculty theoretically managed the composition program, including training the new graduate teaching instructors. The class was pedagogically structured around the theoretical belief that all writing is an argument and around Aristotle's methods of persuasion.\nReadings about the art of constructing arguments, studying famous persuasive arguments, and class discussions were the primary content of the course. Toward the end of the course, students were tasked with developing writing course syllabi, writing assignments, assessment tools, and a theoretical and methodological rational narrative as support for our pedagogical delivery of the freshman composition curriculum.\n\"What did you say?\" I responded back to the professor. I was sure that I had misheard her. I was never allowed to use that word. I didn't use that word, and I couldn't understand why she was using this word in our classroom. I tried to look into the faces of my fellow students and future professional colleagues for help and support while the professor looked at mine, but my fellow students\nlooked away.\nThe class was working in small groups, and the professor pivoted and turned in the middle of the room to ensure that she made eye contact with everyone. I looked at the members of my small group, which just happened to be all the constructed people of color and other marginalized folks in the room: two African Americans (including me), one Afro-­Latinx, one White LGBTQ+ female, and one Muslim student. The remaining and dominant number of students in the classroom were constructed as White American.\n\"N***** is just a word,\" the White female professor said for the second time. She was short, and I swore that she bounced slightly up on the balls of her feet in beat, two times, with the consonant sounds in the word, n**-***.\nWe had read many essays and books, including Pedagogy of the Oppressed by Paulo Freire and the classic \"Just Walk On By: Black Men in Public Space\" by Brent Staples. Freire's text links the struggle of oppression to understanding one's position to the world and power central to the educational process and, in my view, to writing (literacy) acquisition.\nStaples writes about how his education did not prevent him from being viewed through gendered and racial stereotypes. There was discussion of words and their constructed meanings, and the professors emphasized how all words only have power when people who use and hear those words are complicit in the construction of the power: blah, blah, blah, and super-­blah.\nSo I asked a person in the classroom, who is a descendant of African slaves in the United States, if he was only offended by the use of the word n***** because he was complicit in creating its derogatory meaning at the moment the professor let the word n***** slip from her lips.\nIt seemed that I just had to merely concede that in the professor's use of the word n*****, she wasn't really acknowledging the racist, violent, and hegemonic social historical, political, and exclusionary affect and effect of the word on me as an African American and others as non–­African Americans in the classroom.\nIt was just a word. Right? Wow! It was like magic!\nWhere had this theory been all my life, especially when I had been subjected to equally derogatory argumentative identity words of bitch, hoe, slut, darkie, dumb, lazy, stupid, fat, and pussy, to name a few?\nI was trying really hard to understand how our class lecture arrived at this vast breach in the classroom knowledge and experience. I was also trying really hard to ignore her, but I am not really good at that, so I went back into the conversation.\n\"Excuse me. I am sorry, but I didn't understand what you said.\" I thought that was a good place to start.\nI looked the professor directly in her eyes, and she showed no signs of retreating. I was new to graduate school and the ways scholars boldly manipulate and use theory to obscure and perpetuate the silence and invisibility of the Other and their experiences.\nThe other groups stopped working, and the class fell silent. The male professor made his way over to our group and positioned himself closer to the female professor. The male professor didn't repeat what his colleague said, but his physical proximity to the professor's body was a show of support, and his colleague went back in for the kill.\n\"N***** is just a word. Rhetoric is a form of communication, and words only carry the meanings that we give to them,\" she explained like she was explaining how to solve a variable equation on the board for the third time. In that moment the professor created a paradigm where our identities and experiences of meaning could not exist simultaneously. My identity and experiences had to die in order for hers to dominate the classroom discourse, her lesson plans, and meanings that she was so well-­meaningly creating for the classroom.\nCue lovely jazz elevator background music.\n***\nLike some first-­generation Black folks one to two generations geographically removed from the U.S. South, I grew up in a segregated northern inner city in the seventies and eighties. It was a place and time where if you could string a well enunciated sentence together and all your verbs conjugated correctly with the help of Schoolhouse Rock's \"Verb: That's What's Happening\" on Saturday mornings, everybody said that you were \"articulate or well-­spoken\" and that you should go to school to become a lawyer.\nSo growing up and throughout the majority of my undergraduate career, attending law school after graduation was my plan. No shade to lawyers, but if believing in the study and practice of law as my career path (along with believing that it would allow me to one day buy a blue Mercedes for my momma because we never had a car and blue was my momma's favorite color) got me out of the South Side of Chicago to become the first person in my family to complete a college degree, then Patricia J. Williams and Johnnie Cochran was where it was at.\nI couldn't really tell anyone that I wanted to be a writer. After undergraduate years of studying English Literature and student activism, I was sincerely convinced that I didn't want to work in a professional field where I could so compassionately empathize why, in some social situations, citizens were set up to break laws and subsequently be subject to inequitable outcomes.\nI could have never imagined that a year later I would be in a graduate composition pedagogy class with a White professor using racial epithets with Montresor's impunity as a methodology for teaching me—­a first-­generation African American female student—­a lesson on argument.\nAnd I thought teaching writing would be a safe space for me as a woman of color. In that moment, the teacher called me a n***** and did it legitimately because it was within her academic freedom and purview. Because rhetorically n***** is just a word. Right? Poverty, homelessness, oppression, learning differences, class differences, and incarceration are just things. Right? Sexual assault, homophobia, bullying, and disabilities are just things. Right? Students are just bodies that we, as teachers, have the power to mold and to control how we want without really seeing who and what they are and the myriad of ways that they may show up.\nMaybe this is what happens when we teach in spaces, and we don't acknowledge and humble our pedagogy and curriculum to the world in which we and our students inhabit. Those worlds can be the same, simultaneous, overlapping, intersecting, or completely isolated.\nThe sad part is that I think that the professor, like many of us who teach, sincerely believed that what she said and did caused absolutely no harm, so I don't write this essay to shame or blame. I write this essay to release myself and others from the trauma experienced in the writing classroom, and maybe through compassion and empathy my experience can heal and inform our field and us (practitioners, teachers) as we work to transform in the changing dynamics of higher education with a focus on social justice, diversity, equity, inclusion, and antiracism to better teach and serve our students and intersecting community members.\nAll views expressed are the author's own.\nThis is excerpted from Traveling without Moving: Essays from a Black Woman Trying to Survive in America by Taiyon J.

Her daughter Hannah, 25, who shared the video (@hannahpearlr) on TikTok can be heard from behind the camera saying, \"Be cool.\"\nBut it's almost impossible as the new grandmother begins to sprint as she gets closer. The footage then skips to Lori standing next to the crib, eagerly waiting to pick up Aubrey followed by more clips of them cuddling.\nHannah told Newsweek: \"It was a very special moment.\"\nThe gymnastics coach explained there were instant tears when they met Aubrey on May, 22.\n\"We are loving every minute with Aubrey as a family and having lots of cuddles,\" she said. \"Mom is getting the most!\"\nThe video, captioned, \"From best mum to best nanny, you are so loved little one,\" has received over 254,000 likes since being posted on TikTok.\nLori's behavior may resonate with many American grandparents who, according to a Pew Research Center survey, increasingly cherish family time. For those aged 65 and older, the main benefits of aging include spending more time with family and grandchildren, with financial security also being noted as a significant advantage.\nA study has revealed that grandparents are willing to contribute not just their time but also their financial resources to their grandchildren. In 2019, AARP revealed that grandparents spend a total of $179 billion per year on their grandchildren, approximately $2,562 per grandparent. The survey found that those dollars go toward a variety of expenses and spending choices, from gifts to education and day-to-day costs.\nMore than half of the 2,653 surveyed said they enjoy their role as grandparents and rate their performance as high.\nSo far, the clip has over 1,500 comments, and the wholesome interaction has reduced some users to tears.\nOne user said: \"I would donate a liver and half my leg to have a mother like this. Congratulations with the new addition.\"\n\"Shes got golden retriever energy and im so here for it, how beautiful,\" complimented another.\nA third commenter said: \"So lovely to see so much joy and happiness.\"\n\"Omg - random stranger crying again,\" said a fourth user.\nIf you have a family dilemma, let us know via life@newsweek.com.

        "content": "A bride's decision to repurpose her mother's wedding dress for her own bridal reception has captured the hearts of many, as demonstrated by a viral social-media video.\nKelsie Miller's wedding took place at the Waldorf Astoria Los Cabos Pedregal in Mexico on January 13, 2024. She had asked her mom if she could try on the wedding dress she had donned 40 years ago for her own walk down the aisle. After the spontaneous trial resulted in a perfect fit, Miller decided to incorporate the gown into her own big day, but kept all the details hidden from her mom.\n\"I asked if I could use it in a special way during a part of our wedding festivities, and she allowed me to alter the dress as I saw fit,\" Miller told Newsweek. \"But she did not know when or how the dress would be used; she was just happy to share it with me.\"\nThe content creator, who is based in San Francisco, shared the touching moment she revealed the altered garment to her mom to TikTok on May 12.\nMiller enlisted the support of a tailor to get to work on the decades-old gown and bring her vision of a modern iteration, which keeps the \"authenticity of the dress\", to life. She decided to retain the ivory gown's off-shoulder puffed-sleeves and its ribbon at the back, while choosing to shorten its hemline.\n\"I decided to shorten the dress to wear it for our reception where there would be plenty of dancing,\" Miller said. \"I surprised her with it on the day.\"\nThe 3.1 million TikTok users who have viewed Miller's post were able to see her mom's candid gasp of awe and joy after seeing her dress brought back to life. The video, which has garnered over 469,000 likes, begins with a nostalgic scene of Miller trying on the original long gown in front of a mirror, her mother looking on in the background. The video then cuts to the reception, where Miller emerges in a shortened version of the dress—maintaining its original ribbon train that still cascades to her ankles.\n\"She was overcome with emotions—she was so happy and so excited to see her dress after she wore it for her own wedding with my dad 40 years ago,\" Miller said.\nThe bride had taken the DJ's first set as her queue to dash to the bathroom with her maid of honor and get changed into the dress, knowing that all the guests had been distracted. She later took to the dance floor for a special choreographed performance with her dad in the shortened gown, providing a heartwarming surprise for her mom and the rest of her family.\nViewers online have joined Miller and her mom in gushing over the memorable moment and the clean cut of the dress. More than 300 TikTok users have voiced their thoughts and well-wishes in the comments section of the post.\n\"It is not often that this is done so tastefully where the new piece looks equally as timeless and classy, such beautiful work and i'm so in love with the sleeves,\" one user, @_salsakitte_, wrote.\nAnother, @haileyannco, added: \"Such a cute way to incorporate your mom's dress.\"\n\"Oh my gosh how beautiful! I think I might ask if I can do the same,\" a third user, @joysbyjuju, shared.\nDo you have any funny wedding videos or pictures that you want to share? We want to see the best ones!

        "content": "There is something luxurious about putting on a face mask, or relaxing in the bath after a long day, but unfortunately many of the beauty habits that have the biggest impact of hygiene aren't quite as 'sexy'.\nIt is these 'unsexy' tips that make the biggest difference to our personal hygiene and self-care. Reddit users have been rushing to share their top tips after u/caffeinated_hardback asked the online beauty community to share the \"unsexy hygiene tips that make you sexier.\"\nWith a number of tips posted within the thread, Newsweek took five to Dr. Hannah Kopelman, dermatologist at Kopelman Aesthetic Surgery, New York City, who shared her opinion on some of the most-upvoted tips under the post.\n1. u/@NotMarciaBrady: Getting a cream with glycolic acid for my feet. Holy cow, they've never looked this good! I used to slather Vaseline and file at least weekly and that worked for the day, but this cream works for days and my feet are so smooth and don't have dead skin on them.\nThis tip is one Kopelman wished more knew about, as she said: \"Using a cream with glycolic acid for your feet is an excellent tip for achieving smoother, softer skin. Glycolic acid is an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) that helps to exfoliate the skin by breaking down dead skin cells and promoting cell turnover.\n\"This is much more effective than traditional methods, like filing or using Vaseline, which provide only temporary results. By incorporating glycolic acid into your foot-care routine, you're enabling deeper exfoliation, which can keep your feet smooth and free of dead skin for longer periods,\" Kopelman added.\n2. u/@_Dumbledork_: This might be obvious for other people, but I just found out that you should wash your teeth before washing your face, not after. I can't believe a decades worth of pimples on my chin could've been avoided if I just knew this sooner.\nThe same goes for washing your hair, better do it before washing your face, but that was already my routine although it wasn't any conscious decision.\nKopelman called this tip simple, but highly effective. She said: \"The rationale is that toothpaste residue can drip onto your skin and clog pores, potentially leading to breakouts, especially around the chin area. By brushing your teeth first, you ensure that any splashes or residue are washed away when you cleanse your face, reducing the risk of pimples.\n\"Similarly, washing your hair before your face follows the same principle; shampoo and conditioner can leave a residue that may cause skin issues if not rinsed off properly. Adopting this sequence in your routine can help maintain clearer skin,\" Kopelman added.\n3. u/@samalaur: A summer one for you: Wiping my butt and all areas in the bikini area with a salicylic acid and/or glycolic acid. Keeps the area smelling clean and prevents ingrown hairs if you wax or shave in that area. Don't buy the expensive exfoliants at the wax place, just buy a decent percentage acid at your local drugstore or Amazon.\nThis tip has arrived just in time for the summer months. Kopelman said: \"Wiping the bikini area with salicylic acid or glycolic acid is a great tip for maintaining hygiene and preventing ingrown hairs.\n\"Salicylic acid, a beta hydroxy acid (BHA), helps exfoliate the skin and keep pores clear, while glycolic acid, an AHA, assists in removing dead skin cells. These acids can help prevent ingrown hairs, which are common in areas subjected to waxing or shaving. Using these products can also keep the area smelling fresh,\" Kopelman added.\nIt is important not to rush straight in with harsh ingredients on this sensitive area. Kopelman said that \"it's important to choose products with suitable concentrations to avoid irritation, and always do a patch test first to ensure your skin tolerates these acids well.\"\n4. u/@gbtn: I change my pillowcase every day and have a rotation of 8+ silk pillowcases (1 for every day of the week plus 1 for wash day in different colors for easier tracking). My face and hair stay cleaner for longer than ever before!\nIt seems obvious that resting your face on a dirty pillow case can lead to acne and other flareups, but a surprising amount of people didn't know of the impact this has on your skin.\nKopelman said: \"Changing your pillowcase daily, especially to a silk one, is a fantastic hygiene tip that can significantly improve both skin and hair health. Silk pillowcases are gentler on the skin and hair, reducing friction that can cause irritation and breakage.\n\"Frequent changing prevents the buildup of oils, sweat, and bacteria that can contribute to acne and other skin issues. Maintaining a rotation of pillowcases ensures that you always have a clean one ready, making this a practical and beneficial routine for anyone looking to enhance their beauty regimen,\" Kopelman added.\n5. u/@luv_marachk: Instead of using a towel to dry the face after washing, I use soft tissues (and sometimes cotton pads) to prevent transferring bacteria onto the face because towels get so dirty, and you don't even realize it sometimes. This has prevented a lot of break outs for me.\nAnother tip that most won't have given a second thought to; using a dirty or used towel to dry your face can instantly undo all the good work of your skin-care products.\nKopelman said: \"Using soft tissues or cotton pads to dry your face instead of a towel is an excellent practice to prevent breakouts. Towels can harbor bacteria and other contaminants, even if they look clean.\n\"By using disposable tissues, you reduce the risk of transferring these impurities onto your freshly cleansed skin,\" Kopelman added. \"This small change can lead to noticeable improvements in skin clarity and texture. It's a particularly useful tip for those with sensitive or acne-prone skin, as it minimizes the risk of irritation and infection.\"\n",

Despite multiple consultations with doctors over the years, Bravo's skin condition continues to worsen, leaving her and her TikTok followers desperate for answers.\n\"In 2018, I went to Tamarindo, Costa Rica, and on my third day, I woke up with a mild cough and some congestion,\" Bravo told Newsweek. \"When I got home, I noticed a few red bumps on my arm that looked like bug bites.\" Initially diagnosed as sand fly bites, Bravo's condition has worsened over the years despite multiple consultations with various doctors.\nBravo first sought medical advice shortly after returning home. The doctor she visited suggested cryotherapy, but the red bumps remained. In 2019, a dermatologist dismissed the condition as minor bug bites that would resolve on their own. However, the bumps persisted and worsened. Another dermatologist performed a biopsy in 2020, which also concluded they were bug bites that would disappear on their own. The only thing the doctor suggested was a chemical peel for scarring, which Bravo declined.\nThroughout this period, Bravo consulted several other doctors, all of whom were unsure about the condition but assured her it was not dangerous. In 2022, during a pregnancy, her OB-GYN also reviewed her biopsy results and confirmed the condition would not affect her baby, but also apologized for not being able to tell her what it was.\nThe situation took a frustrating turn in May of this year when Bravo's primary care physician quickly diagnosed her with eczema without carrying out any additional tests on her. \"She prescribed me Triamcinolone Acetonide Ointment USP 0.5%,\" Bravo said. \"I have not used or plan to use it without proper diagnosis confirmed by proper testing.\"\nDr. Salar Hazany, a board-certified dermatologist at the Scar Healing Institute of Beverly Hills, told Newsweek: \"I have not seen or diagnosed this patient, but it looks like this woman might have sporotrichosis, which is caused by a prick from a thorn of a plant, likely a rose plant. Other exotic fungi and bacteria can have sporotrichoid spread. They are hard to culture and see in biopsy.\"\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) previously wrote that sporotrichosis is an infection under the skin caused by different species of the fungus Sporothrix, which occurs sporadically in tropical and subtropical countries.\nSporotrichosis can be transmitted through plant debris or through animal transmission, such as scratches from cats. WHO added that its diagnosis depends on demonstrating fungal scrapings or curettings from lesions or biopsy material.\nDr. Hazany recommended itraconazole for treatment, noting that a skin biopsy may not easily reveal the organisms causing sporotrichosis. \"The definitive diagnostic method is fungal tissue culture, which generally provides results within 3-5 days,\" he added.\nBravo has tried various remedies, including tea tree oil, castor oil, and even a parasite cleanse, all suggested by her supportive TikTok community, where she originally shared the post in April under the username cynlza. She plans to continue advocating for a thorough diagnosis and proper treatment.\n\"Many of my TikTok followers have suggested lots of possibilities and remedies,\" Bravo said. \"The TikTok community has been very supportive, and thousands are now following my journey as we all want to know what is on or in my arm.\"\nBravo's determination highlights the challenges many face in the healthcare system, especially when dealing with persistent, undiagnosed conditions. Her story underscores the importance of advocating for oneself and seeking multiple opinions when faced with medical uncertainty.\nThe video quickly went viral on social media, getting viewers from across TikTok. It has so far received over 962,200 views and 23,500 likes on the platform.\nDo you have funny and adorable videos or pictures you want to share?

Look, if in fact we're able to change some of the justices when they retire and put in really progressive judges like we've always had, tell me that won't change your life,\" he said during a campaign rally in Philadelphia on Wednesday.\nThe conservative justices appointed by his rival, former President Donald Trump, are \"already gutting voting rights, overturning Roe, decimating affirmative action, and so much more,\" Biden said. \"Are we going to let that happen? We can't.\"\nNewsweek has contacted the Biden and Trump campaigns for comment via email.\nThe comments serve as a warning about the high stakes of November's election, given Trump's appointment of three justices in one term in office cemented the Supreme Court's 6-3 conservative majority.\nTwo of the court's conservative justices—Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito—are in their seventies, while Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal, will turn 70 next month.\nIf Biden wins in November and has the opportunity to nominate justices to replace any who retire, his appointments could affect the county for decades.\nTrump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has promised to appoint more conservative justices if he wins back the White House.\n\"You know many presidents never get the opportunity to appoint a Supreme Court justice. I had three, they are gold,\" he said at an event in 2023. \"And maybe we'll get three or four more. Can you imagine? Let's have seven. Let's have seven or eight or maybe even nine.\"\nBiden's comments on Wednesday were part of a renewed effort to mobilize Black voters ahead of November's election. Black voters helped secure Biden's 2020 win, but some polling has suggested Biden is losing support among the key demographic.\nAt Girard College, a boarding school with a predominantly Black student body, Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris thanked Black voters for sending them to the White House in 2020 and argued that their agenda has massively improved the lives of Black Americans.\nBiden pointed to his appointment of Ketanji Brown Jackson as the first Black female justice on the Supreme Court as a \"promise made and a promise kept.\"\n\"Because you voted, I was able to keep my commitment to appoint the first Black woman on the United States Supreme Court—Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson,\" he said.\n\"And I appointed more Black women to the federal circuit courts than every other president in American history combined.\"\nHarris also pointed to the lasting impact of Trump's presidency on the nation's highest court, saying he had \"handpicked three members\" of the Supreme Court \"with the intention that they would overturn Roe vs. Wade,\" the landmark 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.\n\"And as he intended, they did,\" Harris said. \"If he wins a second term, I promise you: He's going to go even further. So, all of this is to say, who sits in the White House matters.\"\nUpdate 5/30/25, 3:35 a.m. ET: This article has been updated to add additional information.\n",

        "content": "Maryland Representative Jamie Raskin said that U.S. Supreme Court justices could be removed from former President Donald Trump's presidential immunity ruling by petition of the Justice Department.\nRaskin's theory, written in an op-ed published by The New York Times on Wednesday, follows the recent controversy involving Justice Samuel Alito, who was caught flying two flags outside of his residences that are associated with the \"Stop the Steal\" movement and the riots at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.\nIn response, several critics have called for Alito, a conservative, to remove himself from the high court's ruling on Trump's immunity case, who is seeking protection from federal charges related to his actions in the aftermath of the 2020 election through presidential immunity, as well as any cases related to January 6 that comes before the court.\nConservative Justice Clarence Thomas has also faced calls to recuse himself from such rulings due to his wife's actions related to the January 6 attack. Both Alito and Thomas have also accepted lavish gifts from GOP donors in the past, a revelation that led to the Supreme Court's adoption of its first code of ethics last fall, which prohibits justices from making political statements on issues that may come before them.\nRaskin wrote on Wednesday that it would \"be nice\" if Alito and Thomas decided to recuse themselves from Trump's case in light of the controversy, but that \"begging them to do the right thing misses a far more effective course of action.\"\nThe Democratic lawmaker was, before a life in politics, a professor of constitutional law at American University's Washington College of Law. He said that action could instead be taken by prosecutors at the Department of Justice, who are \"involved in different ways in the criminal prosecutions\" of both Trump's criminal indictment and the prosecution of individuals charged with participating in the January 6 attacks.\nAccording to Raskin, the Justice Department \"can petition the other seven justices to require Justices Alito and Thomas to recuse themselves not as a matter of grace but as a matter of law.\"\n\"The Justice Department and Attorney General Merrick Garland can invoke two powerful textual authorities for this motion: the Constitution of the United States, specifically the due process clause, and the federal statute mandating judicial disqualification for questionable impartiality,\" Raskin wrote.\nThe Due Process Clause, found in both the Fifth and 14th Amendments of the Constitution, states that no one shall be deprived of \"deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law.\" The 14th Amendment specifically lays out that all criminal procedures must be overseen by an unbiased judge, which Raskin writes also applies to the Supreme Court.\nThe federal statute referred to by Raskin, 28 U.S.C. Section 455, states that \"any justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\" Raskin said that the statue, \"if triggered, is not a friendly suggestion. It is Congress's command, binding on the justices, just as the due process clause is.\"\n\"The Supreme Court cannot disregard this law just because it directly affects one or two of its justices,\" the lawmaker added. \"Ignoring it would trespass on the constitutional separation of powers because the justices would essentially be saying that they have the power to override a congressional command.\"\nNewsweek reached out to the Supreme Court press information office via email Wednesday evening for comment on Raskin's op-ed.\nLegal experts have previously cast doubt that the controversy surrounding Alito is enough for the justice to recuse himself from Trump's immunity case. Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told Newsweek last week that while reports regarding the contentious flags outside Alito's home were \"another black eye for the Supreme Court,\" \"practically speaking there is nothing that can be done.\"\nAlito responded to calls to recuse himself in a letter to Democratic Senators on Wednesday, saying that a \"reasonable person who is not motivated by political or ideological considerations\" would not view reports regarding the flags spotted outside of his homes as something that \"meet the applicable standard for recusal.\"\n\"As I have stated publicly, I had nothing whatsoever to do with the flying of that flag. I was not even aware of the upside-down flag until it was called to my attention,\" Alito wrote in the letter, which was addressed to Senators Dick Durbin and Sheldon Whitehouse. The Senators had sent a letter to Chief Justice John Roberts last week requesting that he remove Alito from Trump's case and any others involving January 6.\nFormer President Donald Trump praised Alito's response in a post to Truth Social on Wednesday, writing that it shows \"intelligence, courage and 'guts' to refuse stepping aside from making a decision on anything January 6th related.\"\nOther conservatives have also come to Alito's defense since reports regarding the flags surfaced. After the New York Times reported of an inverted American flag outside Alito's home in Virginia, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters earlier this month that it \"seems to me they're just nonstop attacks on the Supreme Court.\"\nFormer U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton also adamantly defended Alito following reports of an \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag that was found outside the justice's vacation home in New Jersey, telling CNN's Wolf Blitzer last week, that the flag was \"controversial for liberals who have it in for Samuel Alito.\"\n\"Look, it's an American patriotic flag,\" Bolton added. \"I support the right of anybody to fly it. Period.\"\n",

        "publishedAt": "May 30, 2024 at 11:23 AM EDT",
        "content": "Donald Trump holds a substantial lead over Joe Biden among independent voters ahead of the presidential election in November, according to a new poll.\nThe NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist National survey of 1,122 registered voters nationwide found that Trump secured 54 percent of the vote among independent voters compared to 42 percent for Biden in a head-to-head race, with four percent undecided. The poll was conducted between May 21-23 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.\nThe findings showed Trump with even higher support among independent male voters at 56 percent compared to Biden's 39 percent, with five percent undecided. This contrasts with a much closer race among independent women voters, where Trump only led by 50 percent to Biden's 47 percent, with 3 percent undecided.\nThe survey showed that Trump held an even more substantial lead over Biden among independents in a five-way race that included independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr., independent Cornel West, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein.\nThe findings showed that Trump secured 44 percent of independent voters in the five-way race, compared to 28 percent for Biden, 17 percent for RFK Jr., 3 percent for West, and 4 percent for Stein, with another 4 percent undecided.\nOnce again, Trump performed more strongly among independent men in a five-way race, securing 45 percent of the vote to Biden's 29 percent. Among independent women, Trump secured 41 percent to Biden's 28 percent.\nNewsweek has contacted the Trump and Biden campaigns for comment outside of normal working hours.\nDespite the findings among independents, the data shows that the race remains very tight between Biden and Trump overall. In a head-to-head race, Biden leads among registered voters on 50 percent to Trump's 48 percent, with two percent undecided. The findings remain unchanged from a poll conducted in early May.\nTrump has, however, closed the gap on Biden in a five-way race, securing 44 percent of the vote to Biden's 40 percent, with RFK Jr. receiving 8 percent, West getting 2 percent, Stein getting 3 percent and another 3 percent undecided. This is a change from the start of May when Trump and Biden were both tied on 42 percent.\nIndependents are a critical voting block for both Biden and Trump to win over ahead of the November election, which could be determined by close votes in just a handful of key battleground states. Small swings in independent voters could determine whether these states are won by either candidate.\nIn 2020, Biden won Georgia and its 16 electoral college votes by less than 12,000 votes or 0.23 percent of overall votes cast in the state. Biden also won Arizona by less than 10,500 votes in 2020, or 0.31 percent of voters in the state.\nTrump has recently targeted independents with a speech to the Libertarian Party's national convention last week. Trump faced boos and hecklers at multiple points during his address and ultimately received only 0.65 percent of the vote for the party's presidential nominee.\nThe Libertarian Party, which was formed in 1971 and supports civil liberties and capitalism free from government supervision, is the third-largest American political party by voter registration but does not have a great deal of influence in American politics. It typically garners around 3 percent of the national vote and has few elected officials.\n",

        "content": "Despite significant increases in Seattle's millionaire population, the city is facing bankruptcy in several key spending areas, including education.\nAccording to data from wealth management firm Henley & Partners, Seattle's millionaire population increased by 3,700 in 2023, which also included a handful of centimillionaires (with a value over $100 million) and one new billionaire.\nThe analysis placed Seattle as the 23rd richest city in the world and the seventh-richest in America last year. New York ranked as the richest, with 349,500 millionaires, 744 centimillionaires and 60 billionaires, followed by The Bay Area, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston and Dallas. Rounding out the top ten were Boston, Miami and Austin.\nDespite the continued influx of wealth, Seattle is still struggling for resources.\nThe Seattle City Council's 5-year budget review revealed that despite a budget increase of 29% from 2019 to 2024, the city faces a projected $240 million budget deficit in 2025.\nThe Council's review highlights spending during the COVID-19 pandemic as the main reason for the deficit, along with a significant decrease in tax revenue.\nSimilarly, the Seattle public education system faces a similarly large deficit of at least $100 million, with the Seattle Public Schools board accepting that the organization \"is facing a significant budget deficit\" in their budget development report for the coming fiscal year.\nSeattle has seen a dramatic rise in wealth among its residents over the past decade. The number of millionaires in Seattle grew 72% from 2013 to 2023, reaching an estimated 54,200. The city is now home to 130 centimillionaires and 11 billionaires. Despite this surge in wealth, the city's financial challenges remain stark. The new wealth has not translated into increased tax revenues sufficient to cover rising public expenditures​\nFollowing the review's findings, the Seattle City Council pledged that \"our goal is to provide a higher level of services to Seattleites with the same amount of your tax dollars\".\nThe Seattle City Council didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Newsweek via email.\nHenley & Partners CEO Juerg Steffen attributed the growth in wealthy individuals to strong financial markets and advancements in technology. \"Rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, robotics, and blockchain technology have provided new opportunities for wealth creation and accumulation,\" Steffen said in a press release.\nDespite these advancements, the city's budget woes continue. The council is considering various measures, including detailed departmental budget reviews and potential tax increases to address the deficit​.\nSeattle is home to tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft, as well as other big-name brands such as Starbucks, Nordstrom and Expedia.\n",

        "content": "As we edge closer to November's general election, many celebrities are expressing support for either Donald Trump or Joe Biden, but a growing number back independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nKennedy, son of former Senator Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of former President John F. Kennedy—both assassinated in the 1960s—rose to prominence in recent years with his vocal stance against vaccines.\nThe 70-year-old attorney sought to challenge Joe Biden for the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination but withdrew from the race and declared himself an independent candidate in October 2023.\nMany view Kennedy as a controversial choice due to his strong anti-vaccine stance and reported support of conspiracy theories, such as the unsubstantiated beliefs that COVID-19 targets certain races, the 2004 presidential election was stolen by voter fraud, and a link between mass shootings and prescription drugs.\nAs more celebrities speak out in support of Kennedy, Newsweek has compiled a list of them.\nNewsweek emailed Kennedy's press team for comment on Thursday.\nOn Saturday, former New Kids on the Block star Donnie Wahlberg and his wife, actor Jenny McCarthy, publicly endorsed Kennedy on social media.\nIn a video uploaded to Instagram, McCarthy said: \"I'm endorsing Bobby for president.\"\n\"Our dear friend Bobby,\" Wahlberg chimed in, before the duo shouted: \"Go Bobby.\"\nIn 2023, the actor and comedian endorsed Kennedy in the 2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries. Then, in April this year, Schneider appeared on Fox & Friends First to explain why he supported the independent presidential candidate.\nSchneider said health care is one of his top priorities: \"We spent five times more than they do in Europe for health care. And we have way worse results. We can't have 60 percent of the American population, unhealthy, 54 percent of children. That needs to be the biggest story for you guys in all mass media. The fact that children have chronic illness at over 50 percent, that's a 10-12-year-old statistic. So we have to get people healthy.\"\nHe added: \"[Kenny is] talking about things that really matter.\"\nSchneider also stated that people are tired of being offered the same thing, alluding to the potential rematch between President Biden and former President Trump.\nIn a post to Instagram on June 6, 2023, Alicia Silverstone revealed that in 2022, she canceled her Democratic Party registration and registered as an independent voter.\nShe explained that she did this because she was \"deeply disappointed with political leadership at every turn.\" The Clueless star pointed to \"division,\" \"lies\" and \"the profiteering at the expense of the people and public health.\"\n\"But @robertfkennedyjr gives me hope,\" she wrote. \"This man gets me excited about the potential for truth and justice. He provides hope for young and old to trust our government once again. RFK Jr. is a person we can be inspired and be proud to call President.\n\"Bobby is a true leader. He loves our country deeply and is the most courageous warrior. He fights for all mothers and children. He fights for our planet, fairness, and freedom. He is someone who can unify the divide in this country. He is a walking history book; a passionate loving human with no tolerance for corruption or bullying.\n\"I love his vision of peace, unity, and justice for all. I am uplifted by his commitment to protect civil and worker rights as well as our children's health. We need leaders who will resolve poverty, pollution, inequality, and stop wars... Bobby is that leader.\"\nSilverstone finished the post by recommending that those feeling disenfranchised by the government listen to Kennedy speak. She also stated that she has worked alongside Kennedy for children's health and our environment for \"15-plus years.\"\nShe added: \"I love me some Bobby!! He is just incredible. If you want more information, go to Kennedy24.com to learn more about this incredible leader.\"\nOn May 6, Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey took to social media to call Kennedy a \"formidable fighter for justice\" and a \"loyal friend\" when he reposted a promotional video for Kennedy's presidential campaign narrated by actor Woody Harrelson.\n\"There's a lot I can learn from this man. When the world turned its back on me, Bobby leaned in [prayer emoji],\" Spacey wrote on X (formerly Twitter), referring to the charges of sexual misconduct leveled against him which he was cleared of in court.\n\"He's a formidable fighter for justice and a loyal friend that's not afraid to stand up for what he believes.\"\nWhile Harrelson narrated the video, he denied that he was endorsing Kennedy.\n\"Bobby is a personal friend,\" he told USA TODAY through his representative. \"I don't endorse candidates from either party because I'm an anarchist.\"\nCheryl Hines, who starred in Curb Your Enthusiasm, has been married to the independent candidate since 2014. She publicly supports her husband by attending a variety of his fundraisers and rallies.\nWhile Hines supports Kennedy's political goals, she doesn't agree with all of his opinions. On January 23 Kennedy spoke at an anti-vaccine rally, where he compared the pressure to get vaccinated to the Nazi regime.\n\"Even in Hitler's Germany, you could cross the Alps into Switzerland, you could hide in an attic like Anne Frank did. Today, the mechanisms are being put in place that will make it so none of us can run, and none of us can hide,\" he said.\nWhen a video of the speech went viral online, Hines wrote on X: \"My husband's opinions are not a reflection of my own. While we love each other, we differ on many current issues.\"\nIn recent months Jessica Sutta, a former member of The Pussycat Dolls, has been supporting Kennedy and Nicole Shanahan, his running mate, in a variety of posts on social media. She has also spoken at their voter rallies.\nIn an Instagram post from March, Sutta explained that she didn't become a political person until \"my health was ripped from me.\" She claimed that she had been diagnosed with vaccine-induced lupus, which has taught her to \"stand for what's right for humanity.\"\nHer caption continued: \"Sorry to disappoint but I will not back down. I Def [sic] did not feel good yesterday as my body was in a lupus flare but it was beautiful for my soul to be apart [sic] of history. Proud to know @theangiestanton who did incredible yesterday!! Nicole Shanahan is gonna make a perfect VP. Her goal is to end the epidemic for chronic illness amongst our youth. Let's GO!\"\nWhile Pierce Brosnan hasn't publicly said anything himself, a photo of him alongside Kennedy was uploaded to X on September 22, 2023.\nKennedy uploaded a photo of him and the movie star with the caption: \"Two Irishmen at the Kennedy for President fundraiser on Point Dume last night.\"\nIn September 2023, Eric Clapton raised $2.2 million for Kennedy at a private fundraiser. According to a statement from Kennedy's campaign, the event raised $1 million for the campaign and $1.2 million for a super political action committee supporting him.\nTickets for the event, where the Grammy-winning musician performed live, cost from $3,300 to $6,600.\n\"Please join Eric Clapton and me in LA for a special campaign fundraiser + private musical performance!\" Kennedy posted to X in August 2023.\nRumors previously circulated that NFL veteran Aaron Rodgers might have been chosen as a running mate for the independent presidential candidate. While Kennedy eventually chose Shanahan, Rodgers explained how he felt about the possibility of him taking on the role during an interview with Tucker Carlson.\n\"My thing is [Donald Trump] had four years to do it and didn't drain the swamp,\" Rodgers said. \"And whether he just got scared because of what he learned when he was in there — I think it's very plausible.\n\"But that's why I was interested when Bobby came to me and said: 'Would you think about being my running mate?' And I said, 'Are you serious? I'm a f****** football player.' But I love this country, and I'd love to be a part of bringing it back to what she used to be.\"\nRodgers, who led the Green Bay Packers to Super Bowl victory in 2011, told Carlson he considered taking on the position, saying: \"Oh yeah, I thought about it. I definitely thought about it because I love Bobby, and I just wanted to hear what he had to say about it.\"\nRodgers has continued to publicly support Kennedy.\nJeremy Piven, best-known for Entourage, was a surprise guest at \"A Night of Laughter With RFK Jr. & Friends,\" Kennedy's comedy fundraiser in downtown Los Angeles in February. Piven compared white men to Bitcoin during his time on stage.\n\"We were the toast of the town, and now everyone's trying to dump us,\" he said, per The Washington Post.\n",

        "content": "Michael Cohen issued a statement following the guilty verdict in former President Donald Trump's New York trial on Thursday.\nTrump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, faced trial in New York City on 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment allegedly made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg alleged the payment was meant to prevent her from speaking publicly about her claims of having an affair with the former president.\nOn Thursday, a jury handed down a guilty verdict on all 34 felony counts following the trial, which lasted more than a month throughout April and May, while several states held their primary nominating contests.\n\"This was a disgrace. This was a rigged trial by a conflicted judge who was corrupt,\" Trump said outside the courtroom following the verdict. Trump, who has long denounced the prosecution as a \"witch hunt,\" has said he is innocent of all charges in this case and other criminal and civil cases he is facing.\n\"Today is an important day for accountability and the rule of law. While it has been a difficult journey for me and my family, the truth always matters. I want to thank my attorneys Danya Perry and Joshua Kolb for their invaluable guidance and support throughout this process,\" the former Trump lawyer, who served a key witness for the prosecution in the case, told Newsweek in a text message.\nThroughout the trial, Trump's defense attorneys sought to undermine Cohen's credibility, as he was a key witness for the prosecution. They highlighted previous lies he had admitted to and accused him of perjuring himself in the trial.\nThe charges stem from payments made by Cohen to adult performer Stephanie Clifford, better known by her stage name Stormy Daniels, in an attempt to silence her allegations of an affair with the former president.\nProsecutors argued that Trump orchestrated the payments and subsequent reimbursements to Cohen, disguising them as legal expenses to protect his 2016 campaign. Trump has maintained his innocence throughout the trial, calling the case a politically motivated \"witch hunt,\" and that not even Mother Teresa couldn't beat the charges against him.\nFollowing the verdict on Thursday, Trump posted to his social media platform Truth Social: \"VICTORY ON NOVEMBER 5TH. SAVE AMERICA!!!\"\n\"I'm a very innocent man, and it's okay, I'm fighting for our country. I'm fighting for our Constitution. Our whole country is being rigged right now,\" the former president said in a statement emailed to Newsweek.\n\"This was done by the Biden administration in order to wound or hurt an opponent, a political opponent. And I think it's just a disgrace. And we'll keep fighting. We'll fight till the end, and we'll win because our country has gone to hell.\"\nPresident Joe Biden maintains that he does not get involved with the legal case his Justice Department is pursuing. The Manhattan prosecution was brought at the local level, and not under supervision of the Justice Department.\nMany of Trump's Republican supporters took to social media to slam the prosecution and the verdict.\n\"Radical leftists & Deepstate Operatives have been orchestrating this SHAM trial from the beginning,\" Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, wrote on X. \"What do they do now that President Trump is leading in the polls, and their stunt is failing? You don't see this level of corruption in a banana republic, but it's happening in our own backyard.\"\n\"This verdict is the corrupt result of a corrupt trial, a corrupt judge, and a corrupt DA,\" Representative Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican, wrote on X. \"We will stand with President Trump now more than ever to save the country.\"\nUpdate 05/30/24 6:49 p.m. ET: This article was updated with comment from Donald Trump.\n",

Some experts previously told Newsweek that his conviction could complicate his 2024 campaign. Polling has also indicated that a significant number of American voters will consider Trump's verdict when casting a ballot this November.\nIn one survey by Marquette Law School, which was conducted earlier this month while the hush money trial was ongoing, 44 percent of voters said that they would vote for the former president if he was found not guilty, while 38 percent said they would vote for President Joe Biden if Trump was acquitted.\nHowever, in the case that Trump was found guilty, only 39 percent of those surveyed said they would vote for the former president, with 43 percent choosing Biden.\nUpdate 5/30/24, 6:53 p.m. ET: This story has been updated with additional information and background.\n",

The trial, which has garnered national attention, marks a historic moment in the legal troubles facing the former president as he seeks another term in office.\nDonald Trump was found guilty on all charges and now faces potential prison sentence.\nThe charges stem from payments made by Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen, to Daniels in an attempt to silence her allegations of an affair with the former president.\nProsecutors argued that Trump orchestrated the payments and subsequent reimbursements to Cohen, disguising them as legal expenses to protect his 2016 campaign. Trump has maintained his innocence throughout the trial, calling the case a politically motivated \"witch hunt,\" and that not even Mother Teresa couldn't beat the charges against him.\nThe jury deliberated for two days, requesting to review key testimonies and the judge's instructions before reaching their decision. Judge Juan Merchan emphasized the importance of impartiality and instructed jurors to set aside personal biases.\nHe detailed the legal standards for the charges, explaining that the prosecution needed to prove Trump acted with intent to defraud and cover up another crime, such as a violation of election laws​​.\nProsecutors presented a series of documents and testimonies to establish a pattern of deceit. David Pecker, former CEO of American Media Inc., testified about the \"catch-and-kill\" scheme to suppress negative stories about Trump during the campaign. Cohen described his role in facilitating the payments and the efforts to keep them secret.\nThe former president's defense team focused on discrediting Cohen, labeling him as the \"greatest liar of all time,\" and arguing that the payments were personal expenses unrelated to the campaign​​. Trump's lawyers had Cohen admit that he stole money from the Trump Organization and had a personal interest in the case.\nReactions to the trial have been polarized. Trump's supporters, including several prominent Republican figures, have denounced it as unfair and politically motivated.\n\"This is a direct violation of existing case law about jury instructions,\" South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem posted on X, formerly Twitter, echoing sentiments from other conservatives who believe the trial is a sham​​.\nLegal experts and critics of Trump argue that the case demonstrates accountability and the importance of upholding the law, regardless of one's position.\n\"This case underscores that no one is above the law, not even a former president,\" a spokesperson from the New York Attorney General's office said.\nAs the country awaits the official announcement of the verdict, the implications of this trial are profound. A conviction could significantly affect Trump's political future and his ongoing presidential campaign.\nPresident Joe Biden's administration has refrained from commenting directly on the case, but emphasized the importance of respecting the judicial process. However, his campaign took its most public stance yet when campaign officials and supporters made speeches outside the trial on Tuesday.\nIf convicted, Trump could face substantial fines and potentially jail time, though there is skepticism that the former president would actually be sentenced to prison.\nTrump's legal team has already indicated plans to appeal any unfavorable verdict, promising to continue fighting the charges.\n",

It was scary,\" Griner said.\nShe thought of ending her life when she was in captivity, but her family kept her going.\n\"I was at a really low moment,\" Griner said. \"It was, I feel like, honestly the dirtiest I've ever felt.

I was already going through a lot, my family was going through a lot, and that thought right there kept me from doing that.\"\nGriner was arrested in Russia for having less than a gram of medically prescribed THC in February 2022.

I didn't want to play basketball growing up,\" Griner said. \"I wanted to be a cop and go into the military actually. And doesn't it make me more American that I'm demonstrating the protests?

According to DW News, it is the third time that Pistorius has visited Ukraine since the start of Russia's invasion in February 2022.\n\"We will continue to support you in this defensive campaign,\" Pistorius said during his meeting with Umerov.\nThe package included fresh ammunition for the IRIS-T air defense system, which is capable of reaching short to medium ranges. DW News reported that the systems can intercept missiles up to 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) in altitude and 40 kilometers (24.8 miles) in distance.\nNewsweek reached out to Ukraine's Defense Ministry via email for additional comment Thursday.\nPistorius announced over X, formerly Twitter, last week that Germany had provided another IRIS-T SLM and IRIS-T SLS \"combined fire unit\" to Kyiv's military. NATO allies have worked to bolster Ukraine's air defense capabilities in recent months amid an increase in Russian air strikes.\nSweden also pledged a military aid package worth more that $1.25 billion to Ukraine on Thursday, the largest that the country has provided to Kyiv to date. The package will include airborne surveillance and control aircraft, artillery and Sweden's \"entire stock\" of tracked armored personnel carriers.\nStockholm said on Thursday that the package will bring Ukraine's air defenses to a \"completely new capability.\"\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez signed a bilateral security agreement with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier this week that allocates $1.1 billion of Madrid's military aid to Kyiv in 2024. That package includes anti-aircraft missiles, Leopard tanks and ammunition, according to a report from the Associated Press.\nUkraine is also set to receive a large package from the United Kingdom in the coming weeks, which will include naval boats and weapons, air defense missiles, precision-guided missiles and combat vehicles. The package, announced by U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in late April, is worth $618 million, and brings the British aid total for the financial year to $3.71 billion.\nAfter months of debate and delay, the United States' supplemental aid to Ukraine is set to begin reaching Ukraine's frontlines, although Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to Zelensky, told Bloomberg in an interview published Wednesday that the weaponry was taking \"weeks\" to reach where it is needed most along the line of contact.\nThe Institute for the Study of War (ISW) warned in its assessment of the Russia-Ukraine war on Wednesday that Russia was likely looking to take \"advantageous\" amid the delays in U.S.-provided aid to Kyiv.\n",

        "content": "Having solidified his leadership in what others have called \"sham\" elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin has made bold diplomatic gestures toward Chinese and Iranian leadership while continuing threats of nuclear war against Western opponents.\nWith Russia making recent gains in the war with Ukraine, it appears that Putin has been attempting to solidify his presence and reassert power.\nHowever, the recent arrest of a senior Russian commander who criticized Russia's military and its treatment of soldiers in southern Ukraine has led to suggestions that Putin's influence was weakening and that he may be at risk of being toppled in a coup.\nMajor General Ivan Popov, who had headed Russia's 58th Army, was \"arrested on suspicion of fraud,\" Russian state news agency Tass reported on May 21, citing a law enforcement spokesperson.\nPopov was removed from his command in Ukraine's annexed southern Zaporizhzhia region in July 2023 after he criticized the Russian Defense Ministry for failing to provide sufficient support for the country's fighters.\nPopov condemned what he called a \"lack of counter-battery combat,\" too few resources to scout for artillery and the \"mass deaths\" of Russian soldiers.\nIn a recording published to social media by Russian MP and former military commander Andrei Gurulyov, Popov—appearing to be addressing his troops—said he had \"raised a number of other problems\" to the top of Russia's military command and was dismissed by then-Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu.\n\"The senior chiefs apparently sensed some kind of danger from me,\" Popov said.\nThis, entangled with other rumors, has led to online speculation that Putin is at risk of a military coup. But are any of these claims worth believing?\nPopov's arrest did not happen in a vacuum. Earlier this month, Shoigu was fired while three of his deputies were said to have resigned the previous week.\nOther arrests were made connected to a corruption scandal within the Defense Ministry. The head of personnel at Russia's Defense Ministry, Yuri Kuznetsov, was arrested on suspicion of bribery three weeks ago after more than $1 million in cash and valuables were discovered at his properties.\nAt least five people have been arrested in the scandal, including Deputy Minister Timur Ivanov, who has been in pre-trial detention on bribery charges since April 23 after he was accused of receiving bribes worth $11 million in the form of property services from a construction company in return for contracts. Ivanov denies the charges.\nEarlier this week, it was reported that Vadim Shamarin, deputy chief of the Russian General Staff, had been arrested. Shamarin is reported to be a top aide to Russia's top general, Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov.\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied that the arrests were part of a campaign, telling reporters: \"Of course, there is no talk of any campaigning here. It continues in all departments, be it either federal departments or at the municipal level.\"\nThese arrests, but particularly Popov's, began the speculative conversation. Trent Telenko, a former official at the Pentagon's Defense Contract Management Agency who has studied Russian military logistics, posted on X, formerly Twitter, on May 22 that the arrest of Popov was directly related to the idea of a coup purge.\nTelenko wrote: \"58th Army of the Southern Military District, Ivan Popov, was one of the few competent Russian flag ranks. His removal is about Putin 'Coup proofing' his military.\"\nIgor Sushko, a Ukrainian military blogger and the executive director of the Wind of Change Research Group, has made a number of posts since the alleged \"purge\" began suggesting that the changes in the defense ministry were part of Putin's paranoid strategy.\nPosting on May 24 Sushko said that Popov's arrest and the decision to keep him detained in prison was a sign of a \"COUP RISK RISING IN RUSSIA\" adding elsewhere that there were \"whispers of a rebellion among the soldiers.\"\nOther commentators, such as @generalsvr_en, have posted claims that \"General Staff are preparing to take action to overthrow the current government in #Russia.\"\n\"Allegedly, plans for a \"march on Moscow\" similar to the rebellion of PMC Wagner under the leadership of Yevgeny Prigozhin have been developed,\" they added in a post on May 23.\n\"The speakers assured that according to the conspirators' plan, several columns of military personnel with equipment were to move towards Moscow from several regions, and the implementation of these plans was scheduled for early June.\"\nThe echoes of Prigozhin's attempted \"mutiny\" in 2023 have not faded and such a wide-ranging change of hands and arrests at least begs the question of what discontent lies within the ranks of the Kremlin and the Russian military.\nHowever, judging by what's been said and the credibility of some of the commentators making the claims, the notion of a coup is not particularly strong.\nThe reason for Shoigu's sacking is unknown, but it has been speculated that the appointment of Andrei Belousov, a former deputy prime minister who has no military background, is part of Putin's strategy to improve the efficiency of Russia's war economy as its army seeks to push further into Ukraine.\nThe background to Timur Ivanov's arrest has followed investigation and suspicion since December 2022. The anti-corruption organization FBK, founded by the late Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny, who died in custody in February, alleged that Ivanov and his family lived an opulent life abroad that included luxury cars, jewelry and expensive real estate.\nNavalny's team also said that Ivanov had profited from construction projects in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, which fell under Moscow's control after a monthslong siege.\nIgor Sushko, who has also talked up speculation of a \"coup,\" has argued that none of the \"purges\" have anything to do with Navalny's previous investigations.\nIn a post on May 13, he wrote: \"Reality check: None of the purges at the top of Russia's Defence Ministry are the result of Navalny team's corruption investigations. Corruption is just a public excuse in some instances. Putin was the ultimate and knowing benefactor of all this corruption.\"\nHowever, all of the discussion seems to be, at best, informed speculation. While the change in top brass is piquing interest, no real evidence beyond the announcements of arrests and firings cements the claim that a coup is afoot.\nSome of the commentators who pushed the theory have also shared misleading information in the past. For instance, Newsweek has previously fact-checked claims made by Igor Sushko.\nUser @generalsvr_en, otherwise known as General SVR, has also previously shared baseless and dramatic rumors about Putin having died and being replaced with body doubles.\nNewsweek has contacted a media representative at the Kremlin via email for comment.\n",

Here is what we know.\nMultiple media outlets have said the president is looking at using Section 212 (f) of the U.S. Code, which allows him to \"suspend the entry\" of certain groups when the number of crossings reaches a certain size.\nThere has been no official announcement from the White House but Biden and several governors have been fairly open about the fact the Government is looking into what it can do.\nAt the end of February, after Biden's bipartisan bill collapsed when Republicans backed away from the agreement, the President reportedly told the National Governors Association he was exploring executive actions. The Bill would have, in theory, restricted illegal border crossings, made it more difficult to apply for asylum and speed up deportations while simultaneously making more visas available legally.\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox, the Republican chair of the association said: \"[Biden] did say that he has been working with his attorneys, trying to understand what executive action would be upheld in the courts and would be constitutional, and that he seemed a little frustrated that he was not getting answers from attorneys that he felt he could take the kind of actions that he wanted to.\"\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis, the Democratic vice-chair of the governors' group, said governors got a \"general sense that they're looking into whatever they can do on the executive side.\"\nThe administration has since gone fairly quiet on its plan. \"They're in that pretty classic mode of, nothing is on fire right now,\" an immigration advocate who was working with the government told Politico earlier this week.\nA White House official reportedly responded to Politico, saying the administration could still go ahead with the move in the coming weeks.\nNewsweek has contacted the administration via its press office for comment.\nWhite House correspondent for PBS NewsHour, Laura Barrón-López, reported that sources have told her the close-border action could come after the Mexican election on June 2.\nShe said: \"It's going to be expected to be similar language that was used in the bipartisan Senate border deal that failed.\n\"For example, if there is an average of 5,000 migrants encountered each day over the course of seven days, then this authority would be triggered, and President Biden would be able to shutdown the border until those encounters fall.\n\"Now, the White House and a White House official told me that no final decisions have been made about an executive action that is potentially being considered.\"\nShe went on to mention activists' concerns that measures like this, which usually do not apply to unaccompanied children for humanitarian reasons, could \"put people in a position where they make the impossible choice of trying to send their children across the border alone.\"\nThere are also worries that people will resort to more dangerous routes if their points of entry are restricted.\nBut Biden would be responding to something Americans are very concerned about, with immigration ranking as the top issue facing the U.S. for most folks, even more so than the economy, according to a Gallup poll from April.\n",

This came days after Ukraine's top commander, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, said he had signed paperwork permitting France to send military instructors to his country to train Ukrainian forces \"and familiarize themselves with their infrastructure and personnel.\"\nFrance, alongside Ukraine's other NATO allies, has trained more than 100,000 troops since Russia's full-scale invasion began in February 2022, doing so within the European Union. Shortly after Syrskyi's announcement, Ukraine's Defense Ministry issued a \"clarification\" saying Kyiv was \"still in discussions with France and other countries on this.\"\nAccording to Le Monde's sources, Ukraine was forced to tone down its comments on the possible deployment of French instructors to the war-torn country. Discussions on the matter should accelerate in the coming days, they said, and an announcement could be made during Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to France next week.\nFrance would initially send a few dozen personnel \"in order to identify training needs\" before deploying several hundred more, the sources said.\nReuters also reported Thursday that France could soon send military trainers to Ukraine, citing three diplomatic sources who said the training would focus on demining, ensuring that equipment stays operational and technical expertise for warplanes, to be provided by Ukraine's Western allies.\n\"The arrangements are very advanced, and we could expect something next week,\" one source said.\nNewsweek couldn't independently verify the reports on French military trainers and has contacted Russia's Foreign Ministry for comment by email.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron doubled down in March on the possibility of sending ground troops into Ukraine. In late February, he suggested that NATO members could send in such troops, saying, \"We cannot exclude options\" because \"the security of Europe and the security of the French people is at stake here.\"\nMacron has said there are \"no limits\" to France's support for Kyiv.\nOther NATO members, including the U.S. and Germany, have ruled out sending ground troops to Ukraine. In March, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said President Joe Biden has \"made it clear that we will not put U.S. boots on the ground.\"\nRussian President Vladimir Putin warned in February that \"Russia won't let anyone interfere in its internal affairs\" and that his country's \"strategic nuclear forces are in a state of full readiness.\"\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters on May 8 that French troops will be targeted by Russian forces if they \"appear in the conflict zone [in Ukraine].\"\n",

To start, the horizon at the back of the image is curved, with a land mass that appears to be floating in the air.\nThe hands and arms of the fishermen are also bent and spread out disproportionately and the boat is asymmetrical.\nWhile it's not referred to as such in the post on X, the creature ostensibly is supposed to be a lobster, but apart from the claws and legs, it looks wildly different from that animal.\nNo other images of this creature or the story could be found online either, despite the fact that such a haul would be likely to invite local news reports or record achievement prizes.\nSo, while at first glance the picture might look somewhat real, close inspection quickly pulls its authenticity apart.\nThere have also been suggestions from other researchers that the image has been misappropriated to help spread disinformation about the effects of the Fukushima disaster.\nIn 2011, an earthquake and tsunami caused the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan to lose power and go into a nuclear meltdown. The plant accumulated around 1.34 million tonnes of water in the decade since, which has been released back into the Pacific Ocean, consistent with international safety standards, since last year.\nChina has reportedly been opposed to the move, saying it would block seafood imports from Japan despite claims that the water is safe. A Fact Check in September 2023 by Taiwanese fact-checkers found that the image of the giant lobster, and other oversized sea creatures, was being shared on Chinese social networks, tied to stories about Japan's discharge of nuclear wastewater.\nThe Ruling\nFalse.\nThis image is not real.

Current Inflation Rate, Causes and How to Stay Ahead of Rising Costs\nBut not every loyalty program was designed equal to the others, so Newsweek has compiled a list of the top grocery store loyalty cards and how they stack up to each other.\nGrocery giant Kroger offers loyalty perks through Boost, but you'll have to spend $59 for the annual membership. Once signed up, you'll receive gas points and free next-day delivery on all your purchases.\n\"With gas prices still elevated, I advise clients to prioritize grocery loyalty programs with fuel rewards,\" Michael Ryan, a finance expert and founder of michaelryanmoney.com, told Newsweek. \"Even earning just 10-20 cents off per gallon can translate into major savings for families filling up multiple vehicles each week.\"\nRead more: Earn up to 5% Cash Back or More on Your Grocery Purchases\nIn addition to special deals, Kroger lets shoppers sign up for a Rewards World Elite Mastercard, where 5 percent cashback will be redeemed for the first $3,000 spent, with 2 percent cash back on Kroger purchases and 1 percent on other store purchases.\nAnother solid loyalty program is available at Giant via the Giant Flexible Rewards program. Like others, you can exchange your points for discounts on your purchases, whether made in store or online.\nImmediately upon signing up, you'll earn 500 flexible rewards points, which can be used at Shell gas stations. And for every dollar spent, you earn 1 point, with 100 points earning you $1 in savings. You'll also be privy to exclusive weekly deals and freebies.\nPiggly Wiggly, which operates stores across the Southeast, also rewards shoppers with a loyalty program should they choose to sign up.\nThrough the chain's Pig Points, you can score deals on food and gas on specific items in store.\nAt the gas station, you earn $1 off every purchase once you achieve 100 points.\nAlex Beene, a financial literacy instructor at the University of Tennessee at Martin, echoed the advice that shoppers should specifically look out for the fuel deals, granted free delivery can also be a compelling draw.\n\"When it comes to grocery store loyalty programs, fuel discounts are usually the gold standard. Grocery stores have both free and pay-for versions of their programs that offer a standard discount on gas that increases as customers spend more,\" Beene told Newsweek. \"However, for most looking for loyalty membership, it's more about free delivery and pick-up.\"\nPublix is also a fan-favorite grocery chain on the loyalty program bandwagon.\nThe store offers Club Publix, a free program that enables access to personalized deals, birthday freebies and digital savings. Specifically, you'll hear about many buy-one-get-one-free deals and weekly updates on the top sales items.\nPerhaps the biggest supermarket chain across the United States, Walmart has not let its loyalty program slide either.\nRead more: Capital One Walmart Rewards Mastercard Review\nWalmart+, however, is a bit pricier than some of the free options at its competitor stores.\nShoppers will have to fork over $98 to earn 10 cents off each gallon of gas at participating stations as well as free delivery for store orders more than $35. You'll also gain free next-day and two-day shipping from Walmart, and you'll be able to use a contactless checkout option for more easy shopping.\nWith the perks, the option might make sense if you're a frequent Walmart shopper and the savings would outweigh the $98 yearly fee.\nTarget, which likely remains Walmart's greatest competitor, has offered similar options through its Circle/REDcard.\nThe rules are a bit more straightforward: the card gives you a 5 percent discount every time you shop, whether that's in-store or online.\nThere's also automatic free shipping on most orders, and you can return items after a longer period.\n\"To maximize your grocery loyalty benefits, don't just sign up and forget about it. Stack those rewards with digital coupons, sales, and cash-back credit card offers,\" Ryan said. \"Many apps let you load digital coupons that are automatically deducted at checkout along with your loyalty discounts. It takes a little effort but can cut your grocery bill by 10 to 20 percent or more.\"\nShoppers should also consider using a credit card to help boost their grocery store purchase rewards. Several big-name cards offer special cash-back options, which could save you hundreds or even thousands in the long run.\nThe Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express, for example, supplies consumers with 6 percent cash back at U.S. supermarkets on up to $6,000 per year in purchases.\nMeanwhile, the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card offers three times the points on online grocery purchases, and the Citi Strata Premier Card gives the same three times points but on all supermarket purchases.\nJust keep in mind when using a credit card, there are undeniable risks. Shoppers are encouraged to use their credit cards like a debit card and avoid making purchases they wouldn't be able to afford with their monthly income, even if the rewards of using the card are plentiful.\n",

Gen Z (1997-2012), millennial (1981-1996) and Gen X (born between 1965 and 1980) age groups, the trend was roughly the same.\nBy roughly 10 percentage points, the number of men saying they played video games was usually higher among men than women. But Baby Boomers (born 1946-1964) had a different tune.\nWhile half of female Baby Boomers said they played weekly, only 44 percent of Baby Boomer men said the same. And among the Silent Generation (1928-1945), the numbers were about equal, with 30 percent of women playing weekly compared to 29 percent of men.\nKeeping your brain sharp is one key reason Baby Boomers and the Silent Generation might be drawn to play video games despite not growing up with them, but why are more women playing than their male counterparts despite the previous gamer stereotypes?\nAn earlier AARP survey found that the number of older adults playing video games was booming, up from 40.2 million in 2016 to 50.6 million in 2019, and the trend has only escalated.\nA higher number of women might look for brain stimulation in their hobbies than their male counterparts in the Boomer and Silent Gen age range, and they also may rely on games to maintain social connections.\n\"Nearly half of boomers (47 percent) and nearly a third (30 percent) of the silent generation are playing video games regularly,\" Quinn said. \"Older Americans tell us they are more likely to be motivated by keeping their mind sharp than younger gamers, and that's the same for all women despite generation.\"\nBaby Boomers were also the most likely to say video games provide brain stimulation, at 92 percent compared to just 84 percent of Gen Z-ers.\n\"Games improve my critical thinking skills by giving me a chance to solve complex problems,\" one anonymous 37-year-old woman said in the report.\nThe survey also found that gaming was an overwhelmingly white hobby, with 75 percent of players being white compared to just 12 and 19 percent being Black and Hispanic.\n",

Many homeowners who locked in rates when they were sitting at 2-3 percent for years are reluctant to list their homes and be forced to take a new loan at 7 percent, which is where rates for a 30-year-fixed mortgage have been hovering for months.\nThat's exacerbated a major affordability crisis in the housing market, particularly for first-time buyers. While there are some signs that listings have increased in recent weeks as spring kicked into gear—and the average 30-year-fixed rate has eased a bit from recent highs—there are few indications that prices are set to significantly cool anytime soon, especially as the Federal Reserve has pumped the brakes on any plans to cut interest rates in the immediate future.\nRead more: How to Get a Mortgage\nAccording to the Case-Shiller data broken down by metro area, San Diego posted the biggest gains among the 20 largest U.S. cities measured. Home prices in the southern California city were up more than 11 percent year-over-year, followed closely by New York, Cleveland and Los Angeles. Prices in the 20-city index were up 7.4 percent on an annual basis, slightly above the 7.3 percent gain a month earlier and evidence that demand for homes in urban areas — where inventory remains especially tight — remains strong.\nOn a month-over-month basis, the 0.3 percent rise in March was less than the 0.6 percent rise in February.\nThe Northeast region was the \"top performer\" with an 8.3 percent annual rise in prices, said Brian D. Luke, head of commodities, real and digital assets at S&P Dow Jones Indices, in a press release. \"COVID was a boom for Sunbelt markets, but the bigger gains the last couple of years have been the northern metro cities.\"\nRead more: How to Buy a House With Bad Credit\nIt's the ninth time national home prices have hit a new high in the past year, Luke said, and all 20 of the biggest markets have now seen price gains for four months straight.\nIn a sign of just how competitive the Northeast market remains even in the face of high rates, a 1,000-square-foot, 2-bedroom, 1-bathroom fixer-upper in Bergen County, N.J., outside of New York City, received 79 offers when it was listed for $398,000 in late March.

Just have a taste and it's clear why this national treasure of Finland is now storming North America,\" Larry Marcus, the co-founder and managing director of Marcy Ventures, told Newsweek. The firm has not disclosed the specifics of its investment.\nAccording to CB Insights, Finnish Long Drink has now raised over $41 million across 14 rounds of funding.\nThe venture capital firm backed by Jay-Z's investment is significant because of his billion-dollar track record in the alcohol space.\nLast year, he sold his controlling interest in D'USSE Cognac to Bacardi for $750 million.\nMarcy Venture Partners' portfolio include investments in Rihanna's Savage X Fenty lingerie line, streetwear marketplace StockX and robot-powered Stellar Pizza.\nIn 1952, Finland was preparing to receive an influx in tourists for the Helsinki Summer Olympics. In order to help vendors handle the new wave of thirsty customers, Alkoholiliike, the national alcoholic beverage retailing monopoly, introduced two brands of pre-mixed, ready-to-drink gin cocktails known in Finland as \"long drinks.\" (That's the \"legend of 1952\" reference printed on each Finnish Long Drink can.)\nIn Finland, the \"long drink,\" or \"lonkero\" which literally means tentacle, is commonly made with grapefruit soda and gin, though many add touches like cranberry juice and lime.\nAfter Finland joined the European Union in 1995, the government was no longer allowed to control the production of the drinks on its own, and several long drink brands were born.\nDespite the cocktail's popularity overseas — it's also sold in China, Japan and Taiwan — it's path in the U.S., where the canned cocktail and hard seltzer market has become extraordinarily crowded, is far from certain. Boston Beer, the alcohol behemoth and parent company of Sam Adams, tried marketing a brand called Bevy Long Drink that was pulled off shelves last year due to lack of sales.\nStill, the beverage maker has already seen staggering growth stateside, selling 1.8 million cases last year, up from 33,000 in 2019. Sales grew 114 percent from 2021 to 2022, the company told Newsweek. Through mid-April, retail sales were up 92 percent year-over-year, according to NielsenIQ data. Burns said the company sold over 100 million cans in that period.\n\"Our ambition is to ten times the size of the business,\" Burns said. \"People may find that crazy, but the data supports it's possible.\"\nFinnish Long Drink's off-premise sales — such as grocery and liquor stores — have seen triple-digit growth in the last year, per NielsenIQ, far outpacing similar canned cocktails made by better-known brands like Bacardi and Jack Daniel, which also benefit from far greater distribution.\nThe company also touts the \"highest net promoter score in alcohol,\" according to Burns. He said 91 percent of Finnish Long Drink's customers are likely to recommend the beverage to a friend.\n\"Most people don't realize that Long Drinks are bigger to Finns than Guinness is to the Irish,\" Burns said.\nNow Burns is eyeing this summer as a coming out party of sorts for the brand in the U.S.\n\"People are obsessed with the taste, and once they're introduced to what long drinks are and have the chance to try it, they fall in love,\" he said.\n\"It really is like nothing else in the market — the taste is uniquely refreshing which makes Long Drink perfect for a hot summer day be it lakeside, at the beach or by the pool.\"\nUpdate: 5/25/2024, 9:30 p.m.: This article and headline has been updated for clarity.\n",

        "content": "The FDA recently issued an update regarding a previous recall of Fiji Natural Artesian Water bottles over concerns they were contaminated with manganese. But what is manganese, and why is it a health risk?\nManganese is a common, naturally occurring mineral found in rocks, soil, and natural water sources. It is also an essential nutrient—found in a range of foods, including nuts, seeds and green, leafy vegetables—that supports a range of important bodily functions, such as bone health, reproductive health, immunity and wound healing.\nHowever, it is possible to have too much of a good thing. Chronic, excessive exposure to the element can result in a neurological condition called manganism. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, manganism symptoms are similar to those of Parkinson's disease and include trembling, stiffness, slow movement and depression. Additional symptoms, as listed by the National Institutes of Health, can include mania, insomnia, delusion, hearing loss and memory problems.\nThe U.K. government's Health Protection Agency said high manganese exposure could also affect brain development in children.\nIn March, the FDA announced a recall of over 70,000 cases of Fiji Natural Artesian Water bottles over concerns they were contaminated with manganese and three types of bacteria. The FDA has since lowered the classification of the water bottle recall to one that is \"not likely to cause adverse health consequences.\"\nWelders and people who work in steel factories are the most at risk of developing manganism because of the high levels of exposure in their working environment. However, manganese exposure can also occur through drinking water because of the natural mineral deposits in groundwater.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency has determined that in drinking water, manganese concentrations below 1 milligram per liter for up to 10 days are unlikely to cause any adverse health effects, even in children, the CDC reports. However, the FDA says manganese concentrations in bottled drinking water should not exceed 0.05 milligrams per liter.\nNewsweek has contacted the FDA via email and Fiji via its website for comment.\nIn a post on X, formerly Twitter, Fiji responded to questions regarding the March recall, writing: \"We learned of a quality issue affecting select FIJI Water 500mL (24-Pack) cases with PRD dates of Nov. 11, 2023, Nov. 12, 2023, Nov. 13, 2023, Nov. 24, 2023, and Nov. 25, 2023 sold through Amazon.com.\"\nThe brand added in a separate post: \"The notice sent by Amazon does not accurately reflect the issue. We were notified of a quality issue with complaints of discoloration in select product with PRD dates of Nov. 11, 12, 13, 2023, and Nov. 24, 25, 2023.\"\n\"FIJI Water remains safe to buy and consume,\" the brand said. \"This is a quality issue only affecting the specific lots sold on Amazon.com between February 1, 2024 and March 3, 2024 with PRD dates of Nov. 11, 2023, Nov. 12, 2023, Nov. 13, 2023, Nov. 24, 2023, and Nov. 25, 2023.\"\nIs there a health problem that's worrying you?

        "content": "An interactive map shows how Connecticut may be affected by sea level rise as climate change worsens.\nThe projections by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are incorporated in a national map showing that rising sea levels could encroach on several areas of the state. The map allows the viewer to see how different parts of the U.S., as well as individual states, may be affected if sea levels rise by different amounts up to 10 feet. It also calculates how populated areas would fare amid the rising levels.\nAreas marked in blue show the areas of Connecticut that could be submerged if sea levels do not stop rising.\nConnecticut is just one state facing significant challenges as sea levels continue to rise because of climate change. Coastal communities are particularly at risk. A combination of increasing temperatures, melting ice caps and thermal expansion of seawater is contributing to accelerated sea level rise, which is expected to have profound effects on the state.\nOver 61 percent of the state's population resides in coastal areas, according to the state's Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, and nearly 30 percent work within these regions.\nNeighboring states New Jersey and New York are also at risk. In fact, the map shows that much of the Eastern U.S. would be inundated with water if sea levels were to rise by just 3 feet.\nAt that point, water would start to go inland toward Connecticut's capital, Hartford, the map shows.\nA report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the United States is expected to experience as much sea level rise in the next 30 years as it did over the entire past century. This projection indicates that Connecticut's shoreline could see an additional 8 to 10 inches of sea level rise by 2050, with the worst-case scenario predicting up to 15 inches.\nHigh-tide flooding is already a concern in coastal Connecticut cities like New London and Bridgeport. These areas are experiencing more frequent flooding events, which are expected to increase as sea levels rise, according to data from the Yale Center on Climate Change and Health.\nConnecticut's response to sea level rise involves a combination of local initiatives and state-level planning. The state's adopted sea level change scenario predicts a rise of 1 foot 8 inches by 2050. This guides municipalities in preparing evacuation plans, hazard mitigation strategies and revisions to conservation and development plans.\nConnecticut has taken significant steps to prepare for the impact of sea level rise caused by climate change. Several projects involving community engagement, scientific research and strategic planning aim to enhance the state's resilience and protect its coastal communities from the increasing threat of flooding and rising tides.\n",

        "content": "An asteroid floating in our solar system has been discovered to have a very weird and unique double moon—and it might just change the way we think about how planets form.\nThe asteroid—officially titled \"Dinkinesh\" but nicknamed \"Dinky\"—was found to have a tiny moon orbiting it when NASA's Lucy spacecraft flew past it in November 2023. However, subsequent data revealed that the moon is actually two moons stuck together, marking the first time such a system has been observed around an asteroid.\nNow, a new paper in the journal Nature has revealed how this moon—known as a contact binary—may have formed, shedding light on how celestial bodies interact.\n\"Our ultimate goal is to understand the formation of celestial bodies,\" study co-author Jessica Sunshine, a professor of astronomy at the University of Maryland, said in a statement. \"How do planets form? How was Earth formed? We know that big planets are formed by smaller bodies, so studying these little asteroids lets us see how materials behave and interact on a smaller scale. With Dinky and the other asteroids we're flying by, we're laying the groundwork for understanding how planets are made.\"\nDinkinesh is situated in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and measures about 2,360 feet across. As Lucy approached the asteroid, it saw that its moon—named Selam—was actually two small moons joined together. Each of these two moons were around the same size at about 700 feet across, which is a rare trait among the other scant contact binaries we have seen in our solar system.\nSelam takes around 52.5 hours to orbit Dinkinesh, with an incredibly short distance of just under 2 miles between the two. The researchers estimate that Dinkinesh has a mass of about 16 times that of Selam.\n\"There's a lot more complexity in these small bodies than we originally thought,\" said Sunshine. \"With the additional observations taken by the spacecraft, we were able to better analyze features such as Dinkinesh's rotation speed and Selam's orbit pattern. We also have a better understanding of what materials they're possibly made of, bringing us a step closer to learning just how terrestrial bodies are created.\"\nThe Lucy spacecraft's high-resolution imaging system, L'LORRI, captured detailed images of Dinkinesh and Selam, revealing a trough and a ridge on Dinkinesh's surface. These features suggest that a portion of Dinkinesh's material was ejected into space due to its fast rotation and the bright glare of the sun.\nThe researchers theorize that this ejecta could possibly have led to the formation of Selam, with the rest showering back down onto the asteroid to form the ridges seen on the surface of Dinkinesh.\nIn the paper, the researchers note that this discovery offers new insights into the formation and structural dynamics of celestial bodies, challenging current theories and opening up new avenues for research into how systems like Dinkinesh's form and evolve.\n\"One of the things that's critical to understanding how planets like Earth got here is understanding how objects behave when they hit each other, and to understand that we need to understand their strength,\" co-author Hal Levison, a researcher at Southwest Research Institute, Boulder, Colorado, said in a statement.\n\"Basically, the planets formed when [smaller objects like asteroids] orbiting the sun ran into each other. Whether objects break apart when they hit or stick together has a lot to do with their strength and internal structure.\"\nThe findings also have potential for comparative studies with the asteroid Didymos and its companion, which was also explored by NASA's DART mission. Despite being in different regions—Dinkinesh in the main asteroid belt and Didymos near Earth—both systems exhibit striking similarities.\n\"I'm personally very excited to compare the Didymos binary system with this one, especially as they appear to share many similarities such as size, general shape and possibly composition despite being in totally different parts of the solar system,\" Sunshine said.\n\"The Didymos binary system is located in a near-Earth environment while the Dinkinesh system is located much farther away from Earth in the main asteroid belt,\" she said. \"They have very different features but we think they may have undergone similar processes to become what we know of them today.\"\nThe Lucy mission, launched in October 2021, aims to explore 11 asteroids over its 12-year journey, focusing primarily on the Trojan asteroids orbiting near Jupiter. Dinkinesh was a warm-up target added to the mission's schedule, demonstrating the spacecraft's capabilities and setting the stage for more ambitious encounters in the future. After a gravity-assist flyby of Earth in December 2024, Lucy will head towards another main belt asteroid, Donaldjohanson in 2025, before moving on to the Trojan asteroids in 2027.\n",

The projections are updated three times a year and show a range of scenarios that influence potential water use cuts based on varying reservoir levels.\nOne key takeaway from the latest projections is the zero percent chance that Lake Mead will fall below 1,000 feet before 2028. This is a notable improvement from January's projection, which estimated a 3 percent chance.\nHowever, the projections also show a 13 percent chance that the reservoir could fall below 1,020 feet by 2028, a figure that remains unchanged from January. The lowest recorded elevation for Lake Mead was 1,040.58 feet in 2022, highlighting the ongoing risks despite recent improvements. The variability in the projections underscores the impact of weather conditions, which can significantly alter the reservoir's future.\nAny changes in Lake Mead's water levels are important, as in recent years, the reservoir, which stores water for 25 million people living in the region, has fallen well below average.\nIn July 2022, the lake reached a record low of 1,040 feet, the lowest it has been since it was first constructed in the 1930s. This was mainly due to prolonged drought conditions that plagued the southwestern U.S. for years.\nThese conditions, paired with the region's overconsumption of water, meant that water resources were being used more quickly than they were being replenished.\nThe five-year projections are even more important as the 2007 Colorado River interim guidelines are set to expire in 2026. Alongside this, two groups of Colorado River states continue to debate how to manage the ongoing water scarcity crisis, including the operational strategies for reservoir releases.\nThe U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is expected to release a two-year projection in mid-June that will determine whether Nevada needs to implement further water usage cuts. Last year, Nevada had to reduce its Colorado River allotment by an additional 4,000 acre-feet based on June's projection.\nWhile the latest projections offer some hope for improved conditions at Lake Mead, the broader context of climate variability and interstate water politics suggests that significant challenges remain. The upcoming two-year projection will be a critical indicator for southern Nevada, potentially influencing water management decisions for the near future.\n",

The champion diverged from racing tracks to tackle 20-foot waves, describing a moment when he believed \"it was all over.\"\nThe harrowing incident underscores the risks extreme sports pose even to seasoned athletes like Hamilton. Surfing with professional Kelly Slater—who warned him of the dangerous conditions—highlights the level of challenge and thrill-seeking inherent in Hamilton's off-track activities.\nHamilton recounted being advised against entering the water due to the overwhelming surfing conditions at Pipeline. Ignoring the risks, he plunged into the waters, only to find himself struggling in the \"kill zone,\" an area so fraught with danger that one wrong move could be catastrophic. He explained:\n\"Biggest wipeout I had I was with Kelly Slater, on Pipeline. It was like 20ft waves and Kelly was like 'there's no way you're coming out there. You're crazy.'\n\"I turn around and see this set of four waves coming and that for me was like: 'it's over, it's all over.' As I threw my board, I dove down and grabbed the reef and I could hear this wave crash behind me. My board got ripped and snapped in half.\n\"I came back up, obviously gasping for air and the next one was coming so back down, grabbed the reef again as another wave comes over. So I did that three times. I got up, I'd nearly run out of air. I'd nearly drowned, but managed to swim back from there.\"\nSpeaking about his passion for surfing during an interview with DAZN in 2021, Hamilton commented (translated by Google):\n\"It's my favorite sport. There are no phones, you merge with nature and feel more connected than ever to the world. That's the best feeling ever.\n\"I'm crazy because I always try to get on the big waves. I try to go under the wave, go up, go from one side to the other, but I'm not able to, obviously. Normally I have to swim a lot.\n\"The last time I went, I paddled out to a wave the size of this building. It was incredible. I had never experienced anything so terrifying. But I didn't catch the wave, I stayed on the side watching. That day, my board broke in two, I lost it... It was something intense.\"\n",

However, he's going to be out significantly longer than the minimum two weeks.\nYankees manager Aaron Boone spoke to reporters ahead of the team's series finale against the Los Angeles Angeles on Thursday, and said Schmidt won't throw for 4-6 weeks. Schmidt had an MRI on Wednesday, saw Dr. Neal ElAttrache on Thursday, and they determined \"it's going to be a while\" until Schmidt returns to the mound. Obviously, if Clarke isn't throwing for 4-6 weeks, it's going to be significantly longer until he's back with the ball club.\nThis is a huge blow for the Yankees and their dominant rotation. The Yankees are in the midst of MLB history with 16 consecutive starts of five or more innings while allowing two or fewer runs. This streak began back on May 12 and has continued through Wednesday night's 2-1 win over the Angels.\nSchmidt has made three dominant starts over the last few weeks, which have contributed to a breakout year for the 28-year-old out of Acworth, Georgia.\nThe former first-round pick in 2017 has made 11 starts this season and has a 2.52 ERA, which is top 10 in the American League among qualified pitchers.\nHowever, he'll now miss a good chunk of the season and will be replaced by right-handed pitcher Cody Poteet for now, according to Boone.\nThere may be a new replacement on the horizon, though...\nWhile the Clark injury is tough news for the Yankees and their rotation, Boone did have an exciting update on the status of right-handed pitcher Gerrit Cole.\nCole, who hasn't pitched this season due to elbow discomfort, has been nearing a return and could make a rehab assignment as soon as this coming week, per Chris Kirschner of The Athletic.\nMore news: MLB Power Rankings: Yankees Rise, Dodgers and Rangers Plummet in Another Wild Week\nCole will likely need multiple rehab starts before he's able to return, but this puts him in line to return sometime in June, which has been the hope all along.\nCole made an appearance at Yankee Stadium last week in which he threw a 20-pitch live batting practice session, and came out of it feeling great. The next step will be a few rehab assignments, and then the reigning American League Cy Young award winner will be able to return to the Yankees.\n",

The charges stemmed from a misunderstanding outside the PGA Championship venue on May 17. This week, Jefferson County Attorney Mike O'Connell announced the decision, pointing to insufficient evidence to support the charges initially leveled against Scheffler.\nThis development is integral not only for Scheffler but also for the broader golfing community. It dispels the cloud of legal uncertainty that had been hovering over one of the sport's premier figures, ensuring his ability to continue in the sport undistracted. The incident, which involved a brief physical confrontation with Officer Bryan Gillis, had led to serious charges of second-degree assault. These charges could have had severe repercussions for Scheffler's career and reputation had they proceeded.\nThe confrontation took place in a traffic jam caused by a separate tragic incident where a man was fatally run over earlier that day. According to authorities, Gillis alleged that during the chaos, Scheffler's vehicle accelerated, contacting him and resulting in minor injuries. However, dashcam and other surveillance footage, supported by eyewitness accounts, contradicted these claims, leading to the eventual dismissal of the charges.\nScottie Scheffler reacted to the resolution of the case by expressing his respect for police officers and his desire to move on from the incident, as quoted by ESPN.\n\"I hold no ill will toward Officer [Bryan] Gillis. I wish to put this incident behind me and move on, and I hope he will do the same. Police officers have a difficult job and I hold them in high regard. This was a severe miscommunication in a chaotic situation,\" Scheffler stated.\nHe also made a point to remember the real victim of the day:\n\"I appreciate the support during the past two weeks and want to again encourage everyone to remember the real tragedy of May 17. My thoughts and prayers continue to be with John Mills and his family, and I hope to personally offer my condolences now that the case is over.\"\nJefferson County Attorney Mike O'Connell elaborated on the decision to drop the charges, stating:\n\"Based upon the totality of the evidence, my office cannot move forward in the prosecution of the charges filed against Mr. Scheffler. Mr. Scheffler's characterization that this was a 'big misunderstanding' is corroborated by the evidence.\n\"The evidence we reviewed supports the conclusion that Detective Gillis was concerned for public safety at the scene when he initiated contact with Mr. Scheffler. However, Mr. Scheffler's actions and the evidence surrounding their exchange during this misunderstanding do not satisfy the elements of any criminal offenses.\"\nWith legal distractions set aside, Scheffler plans to refocus entirely on his golfing career, with significant tournaments like the Memorial Tournament in Ohio and the U.S. Open in North Carolina on his upcoming schedule. Meanwhile, the Louisville Metro Police Department, criticized for the handling of this situation, particularly the absence of bodycam footage from Officer Gillis, may face internal reviews and possible adjustments in policy.\n",

This new kickoff rule was implemented to mitigate the low amount of kickoff returns the NFL saw in 2023, but the rule is also aiding teams in rethinking their entire special teams strategy.\nRead more: NFL News: Breakdown of Wild Proposed Kickoff Rule for 2024 Season\nPer the new kickoff rule, the kicker of the kicking team will kick off from their own 35-yard line. This is not much of a big change, but things get far trickier. The kicking team's other players will then line up on the receiving team's 40-yard line, while the receiving team will have a minimum of nine players line up anywhere from their own 30 to 35-yard line.\nThe new rule is meant to essentially shorten the field to also mitigate potential injuries from players having to spring nearly the entire length of the football field. The issue with this new way of kicking leaves the kicker by themselves as the last line of defense, should the returner get past the wall of the kicking team's defenders. The likelihood of a returner getting past the defenders might also be heightened with this new kickoff rule.\nBecause of the new rule, teams are already playing around with the idea of changing how they engage in kickoffs. Kansas City Chiefs special teams coordinator Dave Toub broke down the new ideas for kickers to reporters on Thursday.\nToub stated, \"I like to have somebody who can go back and is able to make a tackle,\" Toub explained Thursday. \"(Harrison) Butker is able to make a tackle, but I really don't want him making tackles all year long. If you watch the XFL, we watched every play, I bet kickers were involved in at least 25 to 40 percent of the tackles. In either trying to make a guy bounce back or making the tackle himself, or just missing the tackle. We don't want Butker in that situation. But he will be a kicker.\"\nToub also revealed that the Chiefs are playing with the idea of using defensive back Justin Reid in kickoff stations instead as he \"can go down there and make tackles.\"\nWhat makes this situation a bit more interesting for the Chiefs is that Butker recently made headlines for his commencement speech that was widely considered controversial. Butker's socially conservative comments were critical of Pride Month, implying that it is, \"the deadly sin sort of pride that has an entire month dedicated to it.\" He also implied that women should not enter the workforce and instead focus on being mothers.\nThe NFL was quick to make a statement about Butker's comments, stating, \"His views are not those of the NFL as an organization.\"\nChiefs players and head coach Andy Reid also stated their piece about the situation, with most stating they did not agree with Butker. So far, the NFL has not come down with any punishment for Butker because of his comments. However, it is a bit oddly timed that the team is now considering replacing him on the special teams front.\n",

After disputing an umpire's call on a check-swing appeal, Lopez tossed his glove into the stands as he walked off the field.\nSpeaking to reporters after the game, Lopez was quoted as calling the Mets \"the worst team probably in the whole f***ing MLB.\" Or did he say \"worst teammate,\" as he would later claim? Listen for yourself:\nOn Thursday, Lopez wrote a message in English and Spanish on his Instagram account clarifying his remarks.\n\"First and foremost, I apologize to my teammates, coaches, fans, and front office,\" Lopez wrote. \"I feel that I let them down yesterday, both on and off the field. I also want to clarify my post-game remarks, because I had no intention of disparaging the New York Mets organization. During that interview, I spoke candidly about my frustrations with my personal performance and how I felt it made me 'the worst teammate in the entire league.'\n\"Unfortunately, my efforts to address the media in English created some confusion and generated headlines that do not reflect what I was trying to express. I wish the team the best and hope that God continues to give me strength and guidance in my personal and professional life.\"\nAlthough the disputed quote was intended to be more critical of himself than his team, that's not what got him in hot water with Mets management. Anthony DiComo of MLB.com reports that the decision to designate Lopez for assignment did not depend on the substance of his remarks to reporters.\nMultiple reporters attempted to clarify with Lopez the sentiment he was trying to express. Still, others were quick to bring up the off-the-field struggles Lopez endured last season. Then a member of the Minnesota Twins, the pitcher was placed on the injured list in June 2023 because of a mental health issue.\nLopez's son, Mikael, has endured several well-documented health battles in his young life. Whether that was weighing on his father's heart Wednesday is perhaps an excuse the Mets were unwilling to accept.\nRegardless, the two sides have moved on from a situation that goes well beyond one widely circulated quote.\n",

        "content": "When interviewing potential hires, asking the right questions is key to finding the right candidate for your company. These lines of questioning can reveal a lot about a candidate's skills, personality and fit for your team.\nTo help you get the most out of your interviews, the members of Newsweek Expert Forum discuss their favorite questions to ask applicants. Here are 17 questions they recommend asking, along with what the responses can uncover and why they are so effective in evaluating candidates.\nAsk about their most and least favorite part of their job. This question gives great insight into what aspects of the work they find engaging and what disinterests them. If you listen and probe about how they tackle the least favorite aspects, there is so much that can be learned, including a sense of working style preference, if the job offered matches their interests and how they prioritize their work. - Michelle Tillis Lederman, Author, The Connector's Advantage\nI frequently ask potential hires to discuss a major mistake that they have made in the past and what they do differently now as a result of having made that mistake. How they answer such a question can provide a tremendous amount of insight not only into their problem-solving skills and ability to learn from mistakes but also into their willingness to accept responsibility for bad decisions. - Joseph Steinberg, CyberSecurity and Artificial Intelligence Expert Services\nThere are several, but one I like is to ask people what their goals are in life, how they plan to achieve them, what their limitations and strengths are and if they are confident about hitting those goals. That will tell me a lot about how a person thinks and will behave. - Zain Jaffer, Zain Ventures\nAsk candidates whether they are willing to work overtime, weekends and holidays if needed. I ask this because this speaks volumes to me during those times and their response is vital to me when hiring. It proves they are not only serious but will also be a dedicated employee. - Tammy Sons, Tn Nursery\nI like to ask about one lesson they've had to learn again and again. This question probes into a potential hire's capacity for self-reflection, adaptability and growth. It also gauges their capacity for honesty, humility and authentic communication while unveiling their ability to recognize patterns, learn from mistakes and showcase a commitment to ongoing personal and professional development. - Anna Yusim, MD, Yusim Psychiatry, Consulting & Executive Coaching\nAsk what is the most significant risk they have taken as a professional and what they learned from it. This question not only reveals their capacity for taking risks but also denotes their learning agility and resilience. Any response they give can denote their willingness to step out of their comfort zones. - Dr. Kira Graves, Kira Graves Consulting\nInterview questions for potential hires are designed to uncover facts and nuances about backgrounds, interests, experiences, preparation and commitment to an opportunity. One of the most revealing interview questions probes a person's failures and lessons learned. Candidates who respond with clarity demonstrate self-awareness and resilience, which are necessary for handling complex challenges. - Lillian Gregory, The 4D Unicorn LLC\nMy favorite question is asking where do they see themselves in five years. In asking this, I am looking for the prospective employee to tell me they expect to still be with our firm. It may seem trite, but identifying long-term team members is a critical part of our interview process. Who can grow with us as a firm? Who wants to make their career with us? - Jacob Kupietzky, HCT Executive Interim Management & Consulting\nI like asking about their least favorite job duties. Many candidates want to please interviewers and say they like everything. On the other hand, top professionals know exactly what they don't want to do in their next role. - Krisztina Veres, Veres Career Consulting\n\"What is the constructive feedback that you received in your most recent performance review? Why do you think you received this feedback? What have you done about it since?\" These questions at the surface level are telling, and so are the behavioral insights gleaned from the way the candidate answers the question. For example, it can demonstrate whether the candidate is self-aware and if they practice self-improvement. - Sabina Pons, Growth Molecules\nI ask about what they are in the middle of doing that they're excited about. This open-ended question surfaces what potential hires are passionate about, as well as the correlation between their strengths and the outcomes they are positioned to deliver as a result. The more aligned a candidate's strengths and passions are with the role, the better the likelihood of fit. - Karen Mangia, The Engineered Innovation Group\nI ask candidates to describe their ideal working environment specifically and in a bottom-lined manner. I also ask what that does for them when they have that environment. - Jay Steven Levin, WinThinking\n\"If you were suddenly elevated to the CEO position in your prior role, what would be the three to four pillars of your strategy? Why those pillars? And how would you go about implementing them?\" This is a challenging question that requires time for reflection but it provides exceptional insights about a leader's strategic thinking and their ability to translate their strategy into action. - Eric Michrowski, Propulo Consulting\nI have candidates describe a challenge they faced in their previous role, how they addressed it and what they learned from the experience. The question provides critical insights into problem-solving orientation, professional maturity, learning orientation, collaborative spirit or leadership and emotional intelligence. - Britton Bloch, Navy Federal\nAsk candidates to talk about a time when they felt overwhelmed with their workload or experienced burnout. Learn how they recognized it and what steps they took to address it. Additionally, what boundaries or self-care practices did they implement to prevent burnout and maintain their well-being in high-pressure situations? - Leah Marone, Corporate Wellness Consultant\n\"What major change have you made that has positively impacted your professional life?\" I like this question because it uncovers a candidate's approach to growth and challenges. It shows their self-awareness, willingness to evolve and adaptability, which are all essential qualities for any role. Additionally, their answer provides insight into what unique contributions they can bring to the team. - Gergo Vari, Lensa\nOne of my favorite questions to ask potential hires in an interview is, \"Can you tell me about a time when you faced a challenging situation at work and how you handled it?\" This question allows me to assess their problem-solving skills, resilience and ability to handle pressure. Their answer would tell me if they can think critically, adapt to difficult circumstances and take initiative. - Alan Wozniak, Business Health Matters (BHM) Executive Consulting\n",

        "content": "Pundits in the literary world have been bemoaning the decline of literary magazines for years. These complaints have only gotten louder since the pandemic, which has seen an even more visceral contraction of funding and infrastructure for these long-held vessels of literary import, especially in light of a world full of readers who are migrating toward digital formats.\nLiterary journals seem to be fragile entities these days, lacking in both financial support and staffing as educational budgets devoted to the arts dwindle. And their supposedly lower-brow cousins, popular genre fiction magazines like Asimov and The Dark, haven't necessarily been faring much better, with many suffering lack of support, whether that means diminished advertising or subscription revenues. In either case, the magazine market for short fiction writers is dramatically shrinking.\nLiterary publications of decades and even centuries past were patronized by the general public as opposed to just academic or high-brow readerships, and were one of the few means of escapist entertainment in existence before the advent of radio, TV, and films. Stories by the likes of Charles Dickens and Thomas Hardy in fact started off as serialized stories in popular magazine formats, launching the cliffhanger trope in order to entice the reader into buying the next issue. But as literary and genre-based magazines continue to vanish into the digital abyss, another format has been rising to fill the void and provide homes for short-form, printed fiction: The themed anthology.\nAnthologies seem to be making a comeback at small presses. Anthology submission \"calls\" spike in expectation of holidays like Halloween (horror and thriller-based tales) or Christmas (inspirational stories). I've seen sub-genres calling for everything from a revival of noir crime stories, like Devil's Party Press' Hard Boiled and Loaded with Sin, to stories based on song lyrics, to gory retellings starring public domain characters (The Horror Writers of America's upcoming members-only Scaring & Daring middle-grade anthology). Certain independent presses are making anthologies a repeat venture, like 18thWall Productions or Smart Rhino Publications.\nAnthologies seem to have a more viable business model than fiction-based magazines, since each can be done as a one-off project, as opposed to the continued overhead associated with a long-term magazine. Here are a few ways anthologies have advantages over the traditional magazine format:\nThe trend toward financing entertainment projects like films has begun trickling down to more grounded projects like themed anthologies — which, although burdened with initial printing costs, still typically have far lower budgetary requirements than cinematic investments.\nPlatforms like Kickstarter and GoFundMe are being used more frequently to launch themed literary projects. Ventures funded by individual public donations are not reliant on public funding for their survival — so they don't have to worry about their grants being cut.\nAlthough anthologies are cropping up as a mainstay for independent publishers, major publishing houseshave also backed anthology projects. Strategies for such projects include hiring a high-profilewriter in the genre in question as an editor, which not only lends cachet to the finished product but often makes it easier to recruit other high-caliber, name-brand authors to contribute to the piece.\nSuch projects typically also leave slots for up-and-coming storytellers, recruited through more broad submission calls, providing the opportunity for lesser-known authors to be associated with established professionals in their genre. For example, the relaunched Weird Tales magazine recently published the 100 Years of Weird anthology, featuring classic pieces previously featured in the magazine, from \"the giants of speculative fiction\" such as R. L. Stine, Ray Bradbury, H. P. Lovecraft, and Isaac Asimov, mixed with some more contemporaries in the genre.\nAlthough the prestige of appearing in a literary magazine like The Paris Review will hardly be replaced, reading for the pleasure and adventure of it all (as opposed to for more high-brow purposes) has its value. It's also often more marketable — and at least somewhat more lucrative. Let's face it — more people go out of their way to purchase and read genre fiction.\nAnthologies tend to take a less academic and more entertaining, pop-culture approach to collections, drawing on a high-quality talent pool that reaches far beyond the finite world of literary fiction. A more mainstream approach to literature also tends to promote a broader range of thought, as opposed to the similitude that tends to pervade many academic environments of late.\nAcademia also leans toward avoiding a host of topics that this echelon has deemed triggering, which veers toward the suppression of concepts that still need to be discussed and aired within our society. Or at least, within the safe outlet of our entertainment.\nDepending on the business model, anthologies can be self-sustaining projects. These projects often require submission fees from authors in order to cover basic costs for professional cover designs and basic printing fees.\nYet as platforms like Amazon and IngramSpark evolve, the world of print-on-demand book production has shifted the upfront costs away from independent publishers and authors. Posting a book for sale on either of those platforms is free for independent authors, and author costs for print copies are minimal.\nSo, although the slow deterioration of literary and fiction-bearing publications is a sad state of affairs, it's true that nature abhors a vacuum — and market voids tend to be filled one way or the other. The emergence of cleverly themed anthologies could be the saving grace of the short-form fiction world, whether they appear as recurring offerings from a roster of specialty publishers, or as a one-off labor of love from an individual editor, providing near-endless reading experiences for story lovers of all genres.\n",

        "content": "As evidenced by recent communications from the SEC, corporate boards are increasingly being made to bear ultimate responsibility when it comes to cybersecurity; while the management of cybersecurity risk is the responsibility of CEOs — who normally delegate much of the day-to-day management to a CISO or the like — the oversight of that management is the responsibility of directors.\nYet, despite what seems to be a decades-long barrage of daily news reports of cyberattacks wreaking havoc, when it comes to overseeing the mitigation of cyber risk, corporate boards often fail to perform as needed and intended. It is not hard to understand why such a problem exists; cybersecurity is a relative newcomer to the list of major risks that businesses face, and cyber risks evolve far faster than do other \"classic\" forms of risk, such as those related to accounting, legal, or physical dangers. The business world has far less relevant collective experience managing cyber risk than it does most other forms of risks — and there is even less wisdom that we can leverage from prior generations when it comes to actually overseeing the management of such risks.\nBoards, of course, do not ignore cybersecurity — to the contrary, today's directors are, generally speaking, both well aware of the importance of cybersecurity and highly committed to ensuring that their respective management teams properly mitigate against cyber risk. Boards regularly not only pay homage to cyber risk but back up their lip service by encouraging senior management to allocate steadily increasing budgets for defense against it.\nBut, as the saying goes, \"the road to hell is paved with good intentions\"; while boards certainly want to do what they are supposed to in order to oversee the management of cyber risk, the sad reality is that boards of directors often fail to achieve their mission in this regard, primarily because many boards simply do not have members with sufficient enough relevant knowledge, experience, and skills to understand how to meaningfully fulfill the board's role vis-à-vis cybersecurity. Such a phenomenon also creates a danger; in some cases, ill-conceived board actions can even harm organizational cybersecurity rather than help to improve it.\nIn some cases, boards lacking adequate representation of people with appropriate cybersecurity-related backgrounds can go for long periods of time without appearing to suffer from any problems from the deficiency. In fact, entities with such boards may even boast of having made great investments in information-security programs; eventually, however, after some form of cybersecurity \"incident\" occurs, the false sense of security quickly erodes, the investments are revealed to have been made in a far from optimal fashion, and the barrier to cyberattacks that many thought was the virtual equivalent of the walls of a fort is discovered to appear to be closer in nature to that of Swiss cheese.\nSometimes, cybersecurity-related discussions in boardrooms seem to offer great promise but are, in reality, unproductive sessions in which directors attempt to perform part of the job of the CISO instead of focusing on their responsibility to oversee the CISO's management of cyber risk. Sometimes, important issues may be raised, but, because directors believe that they understand the matter under discussion better than they actually do, they don't realize that important issues remain unresolved. On other occasions, there isn't enough experience in the room to understand the matter under discussion; I am even aware of a board meeting in which a director joked that he needed a translator in order to understand a presentation by the CISO.\nAs fiduciaries, boards are tasked with ensuring that their respective management teams have implemented proper plans to ensure that their respective businesses are adequately resilient in the event of cyberattacks (which are, over time, inevitable) and that any remaining exposures are limited to known, acceptable, and manageable risk levels. As a result, cybersecurity risk is becoming a staple of internal audit functions. Yet, because cybersecurity is a relatively new discipline, many organizations plan and measure cybersecurity-related matters using KPIs that may sound to accountants and lawyers as if they were appropriate and effective criteria for measuring success, but which are, in fact, improperly selected and severely flawed.\nBoard members often hear, and accept at face value, reports of cybersecurity success based on criteria that are not only not meaningful, but often misleading. How many times have I heard of organizations that measured the number of breaches per quarter — without any knowledge of how many attacks were launched to begin with, without understanding the relative potential damage from the various compromises, and ignoring the fact that, by far, the most harmful breaches are likely to be the ones that have not been reported because they have not been detected?\nAlong that line, it is important to understand that boards are tasked to oversee risk — that is, ensuring that senior management has properly implemented appropriate risk management plans — not to perform actual risk management. Yet, when it comes to cyber risks, it is not uncommon to find directors dedicating considerable amounts of time to discussing cybersecurity matters that should be handled by the CISO and remain outside of their areas of focus, while, simultaneously, failing to discuss key elements of what they actually do need to cover.\nI have seen board meetings get sidetracked when directors unnecessarily involved themselves in a detailed discussion about the results of a recent company-wide phishing simulation; instead of focusing their attention on how well the company could withstand a phishing attack — or any form of cyberattack — the folks in charge of overseeing the management of cyber risk expended considerable time and energy on speculating why the employees of particular departments outperformed their counterparts vis-à-vis not falling prey to spoofed emails. The board needs to understand how well the company can withstand the damage of an attack — not whether it is 27% or 28% of employees who need to take a training class.\nIn short, it is of critical importance for boards to ensure that they have members with cybersecurity experience — but time should be taken to ensure that it is the right type of cybersecurity experience; simply adding someone to a board because they worked in the cybersecurity field can lead to problematic circumstances, and ultimately, nasty surprises.\n",

        "content": "Today's leaders accept business disruptions as a given, regardless of whether the drivers of change originate from inside or outside company walls.\nThe rapid adoption of technologies like AI, next-generation cloud services, IoT devices, and more are only accelerating the pace of innovation required by organizations. As leaders, we need to prepare for these evolutions because there's a growing expectation for us to proactively plan for each new wave of disruption.\nYet, while 97% of senior executives now consider organizational resilience as very or somewhat important, nearly half still say they're not fully equipped to manage disruption when it occurs.\nThat's a problem.\nFrom starting my career at West Point and serving as a captain in the military to decades spent working for some of the world's largest technology and data companies, every leadership role I've held has involved finding ways to make the most of disruption.\nThese experiences have taught me a vital lesson: As leaders, our ability to guide our organizations and employees through disruption isn't just talk. Finding opportunities for growth amid uncertainty is a responsibility we must take seriously and a skill set we as leaders can refine.\nIntention alone won't bridge the gap between disruption and opportunity. Leading effectively means getting your hands dirty and providing critical support when it's needed most.\nAcross my diverse leadership experiences, here are three tactics that have served me well:\nAny new challenge — whether it's a major market shift or a pandemic — is best faced head-on. To avoid inaction, my leadership team and I focus on what we call \"big rocks.\" These are key areas where relatively immediate improvements generate outsized, long-term business impacts. Examples of big rocks might include improving customer experience or moving the needle on automation.\nThis philosophy is driven by the reality that it's impossible for me to fine-tune every last business detail (and not the best use of my time either). I'm responsible for charting a course and securing buy-in from our teams. Beyond that, I have to trust that the right talent is in place to execute our company vision in the face of evolving challenges.\nFreeing myself from the expectation that it's my job to fix every problem and address every detail has helped me become a more proactive and future-forward leader — a leader ready to inspire progress, not stand in the way of it. I couple this mentality with owning our strengths. A clear awareness of the areas in which your business is solid frees up resources to effectively tackle the disruptions that truly require your attention to keep up. For example, working in the telecommunications space, I rarely lose sleep over our business model becoming obsolete. As technology continues to evolve, fiber will remain a necessity to power that evolution. Knowing this, we can instead concentrate on innovating our offerings to stay ahead of changing customer demands.\nNot questioning every last detail means I can focus on the bigger picture, apply myself directly to opportunities to evolve the business, and then share that vision with my company and other leaders.\nMy theory is that when our competitors sneeze, it's only a matter of time before we catch a cold. If you haven't already, make a habit of monitoring developments across your industries and competitors. Paying close attention to the market is a simple, yet effective indicator of trends or challenges heading your way.\nThere's no single way to source this information. You might host a customer advisory board or, like my team, produce a weekly digest covering relevant company, industry, and competitor news. It can even be as straightforward as plugging in more often with team members who regularly interact with key stakeholders.\nIt's the intention behind your efforts that matters most. This level of organizational foresight can be difficult to achieve at the employee level, but as leaders, we have the networks and experiences to spot trends as they're happening — and before they land on our doorstep.\nWhether it's economic instability, a healthcare crisis, or quick-turn technology innovations, an agile and supportive company culture can prove the difference between a team that goes under and one that rises above.\nAs a recent example of this dynamic at play, consider that three-fourths of workers shared that their employer's organizational values helped them navigate the COVID-19 pandemic — and 94% of managers reported that a positive workplace culture builds a resilient team.\nAs leaders, there are multiple steps we can take to ensure cultural components help mitigate the impact of disruption on our organizations.\n• We lead by example. We have the organizational visibility and reach to positively impact culture and set the tone for those we work with, both directly and indirectly.\n• We pull the right strings. We're in a position to merge tactical and strategic initiatives that center around core cultural gains. This might look like advocating for upgrading systems that benefit employee experience while working alongside AI to increase efficiency and scale.\n• We know when to ask for help. It's just as important to ask for help as it is to lead. For example, at my company, we've prioritized bringing in trusted corporate culture leaders to help guide me and my direct reports on key initiatives.\nAs leaders, it's time to rethink our default reaction to disruption. Don't panic.\nThe more we face disruptions head-on, the better we become at leading our organizations through challenges. In many ways, it's when we're needed most.\nWith the right planning, strategy, and mindset, we can view disruption as an opening for innovation and differentiation. Previous roadblocks morph into opportunities that push our organizations forward, pressure testing both operational mechanisms and cultural connections so we emerge stronger on the other side.\n",

        "content": "Imagine this scenario: a hospital interpreter receives an unexpected call informing her that her son's preschool teacher quit and they need to keep him home for the foreseeable future. She loved her job, it paid well, and she was essential in bridging communication gaps between patients and healthcare providers. But she had to leave that great job, and her son had to leave the school he loves, because the teacher couldn't afford to remain in the profession.\nThis scenario is far from isolated — many of the readers of this article have great former employees who left for similar reasons. It reflects a broader, systemic issue impacting countless families and, by extension, businesses across the nation. As business leaders, it underscores a critical question: how can we prepare to address our teams' childcare dynamics? How can we support our families and — in the process — build the economic resilience of our businesses?\nThe link between inadequate child care and economic strain is well-documented but bears repeating due to its substantial impact. A report by the Council for a Strong America reveals that the U.S. loses an estimated $122 billion annually due to childcare challenges that affect parents' ability to work effectively. This figure encapsulates lost earnings, diminished productivity, and reduced tax contributions. But the cost is not solely monetary — it also manifests in reduced workplace diversity and stifled professional growth, particularly among women who disproportionately bear the brunt of childcare shortages.\nAnd as the US Chamber Foundation notes: businesses are already paying for the lack of sufficient childcare. A survey highlighted in the report shows that 62% of employers cited child care as a reason they had lost employees from the workforce, and that doesn't even capture the costs of absenteeism or related stress. Beyond individual businesses, these disruptions ripple through every sector of the economy.\nThe opportunities for businesses investing in child care are robust. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation published a toolkit demonstrating how businesses can support child care for their employees (they have a lot of options), noting that businesses see very tangible benefits including reductions in absenteeism and increases in productivity. These benefits represent a fundamental improvement in the quality of work-life for employees, fostering a more committed and content workforce.\nMoreover, employees are just more likely to remain with an employer who actively supports their work-life balance, reducing recruitment and training costs associated with high turnover. An additional layer of benefit comes from enhanced company reputation. Businesses recognized for their supportive practices attract top talent and often see increased consumer favorability, which can drive sales and increase market share.\nThe benefits of child care support also extend into fostering a more inclusive workplace. By alleviating one of the key barriers to full workforce participation — especially for women and single parents — businesses promote diversity and equality. This not only enriches the workplace culture but also introduces a broader range of perspectives and skills into the organization, strengthening its adaptability and innovation capability.\nSo far we've focused on the short-term effects of child care on our teams. Investments in early childhood care and education also generate remarkably high long-term returns — ranging from enhanced educational achievements to longer-term economic productivity. Supporting the brain development of the next generation through evidenced-based 'serve-and-return' practices is not only an investment in children's potential but an integral strategy for securing a robust future economy.\nThis is all to say: our influence is not limited to our own companies. When business leaders share their perspectives on child care in the public sphere, they not only contribute to the policy debate but often steer it toward meaningful reform. Ever seen a legislator vote against something that is supported by both the Chamber of Commerce and Early Learning teachers? Me neither.\nWhile we may have influence, we also have competing priorities demanding our attention. If you want help from folks who make it easier to engage in this work, the Council for a Strong America has a coalition called Ready Nation, which is a group of business leaders advocating for early childhood investments.\nOur hospital interpreter's experience is not just a personal ordeal for her; it is a narrative echoing across the business landscape, calling for a reevaluation of how child care is integrated with workforce management. By recognizing the extensive benefits and acting on the business case for childcare support, companies can transform these challenges into strategic opportunities.\nIn doing so, they not only assist their employees and fortify their operations but also pave the way for a more resilient and thriving economic future. We have both a significant opportunity and a profound responsibility to advocate for and implement effective childcare support, rallying not just for the well-being of our enterprises but for the betterment of our communities.\n",

        "content": "Melinda French Gates, one of the world’s preeminent philanthropists, said Monday she would resign as co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation that she has helped lead since 2000.\nThe foundation has made nearly $78 billion worth of grant payments in the nearly 25 years since its founding.\nFrench Gates made the decision “after considerable reflection, based on how she wants to spend the next chapter of her philanthropy,” the foundation’s CEO, Mark Suzman, wrote in a statement Monday. “Melinda has new ideas about the role she wants to play in improving the lives of women and families in the U.S. and around the world. And, after a difficult few years watching women’s rights rolled back in the U.S. and around the world, she wants to use this next chapter to focus specifically on altering that trajectory.”\nAs part of her separation agreement from former husband Bill Gates, French Gates said she will receive an additional $12.5 billion for her charitable work.\n“This is not a decision I came to lightly,” she said in a statement posted on X. “I am immensely proud of the foundation that Bill and I built together and of the extraordinary work it is doing to address inequities around the world.”\nFrench Gates said she plans to leave the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation on June 7, and she will share more about her future charitable plans in the near future.\nThe organization will change its name to the Gates Foundation, and Bill Gates will become the sole chair, Suzman said.\n“I am sorry to see Melinda leave, but I am sure she will have a huge impact in her future philanthropic work,” wrote Bill Gates in a separate statement Monday, also posted on X.\n“Looking ahead, I remain fully committed to the Foundation’s work across all our strategies, and to realizing the opportunities we have to continue improving the lives of millions around the world,” he wrote.\nFrench Gates’ exit had been telegraphed for several years. Bill Gates and French Gates announced their divorce in May 2021. They said at the time they would allow themselves a kind of trial period through 2023 to determine if they could continue working with one another to oversee their massive charitable foundation.\nSuzman announced in July 2021 a contingency plan “to ensure the continuity of the foundation’s work.”\n“If after two years either decides they cannot continue to work together as co-chairs, French Gates will resign her position as co-chair and trustee,” Suzman said.\nGates will remain in control and, essentially, buy French Gates out of the foundation, Suzman said at the time. French Gates would receive “personal resources” from Gates for her own philanthropic work — resources that would be “completely separate from the foundation’s endowment.”\nIn January 2022, the foundation announced four new members to its board of trustees to help bolster the foundation’s governance in the wake of the divorce. It marked the first time the Gates foundation added outsiders to the charity’s board in its two-decade history. The charity had no trustees beside Bill and Melinda French Gates since Bill Gates Sr.’s death in 2020 and Warren Buffett’s resignation in June 2021 after 15 years on the board.\n“I want to reassure you that the millions of people our work serves and the thousands of partners we work alongside can continue to count on the foundation,” said Suzman in a post on the foundation’s website Monday afternoon. “The foundation today is stronger than it has ever been.”\n“I know we all wish Melinda the best in her next chapter,” he added, noting that French Gates “will not be bringing any of the foundation’s work with her when she leaves.”\nThe $75.2 billion Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s mission is to improve health care in developing countries, enhance educational opportunities and reduce poverty by providing grants and support to various initiatives and organizations around the world.\nFrench Gates also founded Pivotal Ventures, a separate charity that focuses on removing barriers for minorities and women in the United States, in 2015. She committed $1 billion to the organization in 2019.\nThe Microsoft cofounder and French Gates have both pledged to donate the vast majority of their wealth to the foundation as well as to other philanthropic endeavors.\nIn an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria in January, Gates said he and partners like Buffett have given away about $100 billion into the foundation. With plans to spend $9 billion a year, Gates anticipates he’ll have given away all of his money in about 20 years.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments and context.\nCNN’s Nicole Goodkind, Allison Morrow and Jenn Korn contributed to this report.\n",

        "content": "Ghost Shark and Manta Ray protect the undersea realm. Sounds like the plot of a future Marvel movie, but in actual fact, it’s what could be the future of Pacific naval defenses.\nGhost Shark and Manta Ray are the names of prototype uncrewed underwater vehicles – UUVs or drones – introduced recently by Australia and the United States respectively.\nExperts say the submersibles could represent the future of undersea warfare, showing the ability to exert power while minimizing the danger to human life.\nThe use of drones in aerial warfare has become commonplace. The US used them extensively during conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan beginning in the 1990s, and newer, cheaper drones have become key pieces of military hardware for both sides in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nKyiv has also built naval surface drones, which have inflicted heavy losses on the much larger and more expensive ships of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet.\nAerial and surface sea drones can be controlled using satellites and light and radio waves. But those don’t function in the same way in the depths.\nA 2023 study published in the Swiss journal Sensors points out that underwater communications require more energy but still see significant data loss to variables including water temperature, salinity and depth.\nMakers of the new generation of military UUVs aren’t saying how they would overcome communications problems.\nBut when Australia unveiled Ghost Shark last month, it called the prototypes “the most advanced undersea autonomous vehicles in the world.”\n“Ghost Shark will provide Navy with a stealthy, long-range autonomous undersea warfare capability that can conduct persistent intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR) and strike,” a statement from the Australian Defense Ministry said, adding that it expects the first production models to be delivered by the end of next year.\nAustralian officials and those from manufacturer Anduril Australia said they could not share any of the specs on Ghost Shark as those remain classified.\nBut they touted the speed with which the submersible has gone from idea to testing, with the program having started just two years ago.\n“Being ahead of schedule, on budget, it’s pretty unheard of,” Shane Arnott, Anduril’s senior vice president for engineering, told reporters.\n“Delivering the first Ghost Shark prototype ahead of schedule sets a new standard for capability development at the speed of need,” Australia’s chief defense scientist, Tanya Monro, said in a statement.\nEmma Salisbury, a fellow at the British think tank Council on Geostrategy, said the Ghost Shark seems much like the Orca extra-large UUV being developed in the US.\nRelated article\nA Ukrainian pilot outlines how drones powered by jet skis sunk a Russian warship\n“I assume that they are all intended for roughly similar mission sets – persistent intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and strike capability, particularly in the anti-submarine domain,” Salisbury said.\nThe US Navy called the Boeing-built Orca UUV “a cutting-edge, autonomous, unmanned diesel-electric submarine with a modular payload section to execute a variety of missions” in a December news release on the delivery of a first Orca test platform, an early prototype.\nHaving a modular payload means the Orca in theory could carry different weapons varieties depending upon the task or be fitted with specialized equipment for reconnaissance or possibly intelligence gathering.\nThe release said the Pentagon would acquire five more of the UUVs, without giving a timetable. But the US Orca has been in the works for more than a decade, the Navy release said, a sharp contrast to the speed with which Australia has developed Ghost Shark.\nChris Brose, Anduril’s chief strategy officer, said the company and Australia are in the “process of proving” that “these kinds of capabilities can be built much faster, much cheaper, much more intelligently.”\nAnduril Australia said the entirely domestically developed Ghost Shark would be made available for export after it joins the Australian naval fleet.\nMeanwhile, back across the Pacific, the Orca isn’t the only UUV being developed in the US.\nAmerica’s latest UUV entry is Northrop Grumman’s Manta Ray, a prototype of which was tested off Southern California in February and March.\nThe Defense Advanced Research Products Agency (DARPA), the Pentagon branch in charge of developing new technologies, says Manta Ray’s strength is in its modularity, the ability to switch out payloads depending on the mission.\nIt can be broken down and fit into five standard shipping containers, move to where it’s going to be deployed, and reassembled in the field, according to Northrop Grumman.\nThe prototype was built in Maryland and then reassembled on the California coast.\n“The combination of cross-country modular transportation, in-field assembly, and subsequent deployment demonstrates a first-of-kind capability for an extra-large UUV,” Kyle Woerner, who heads the Manta Ray program at DARPA, said in an agency news release.\nHe also noted the modular transport method means the Manta Ray can save internal energy for its mission, rather than using it to get to the deployment site.\nLike the Orca, the Manta Ray hasn’t come together as quickly as Ghost Shark. Its program began in 2020 and DARPA didn’t give a goal for the Manta Ray – or some variant of it – to join the US fleet.\nRelated article\nA Houthi missile was just seconds from hitting a US warship. The Navy used its ‘last line of defense’\n“DARPA is engaging with the U.S. Navy on the next steps for testing and transition of this technology,” the agency’s release said.\nMeanwhile, China, named by the US military as its “pacing threat” in the Pacific, is also making advances in UUVs, Salisbury said.\n“While details are scarce, as with most Chinese capabilities, they have been developing them for at least 15 years and likely now have something similar to the Orca (but with torpedoes) in the testing phase,” she said.\nSubmarine expert H I Sutton says on his Covert Shores website that, according to an analysis of open-source intelligence, Beijing is believed to have at least six extra-large UUVs under development.\nBesides Australia, the US and China, other countries working on UUVs include Canada, France, India, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Norway, Russia, South Korea, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, according to Sutton.\n",

        "content": "Chanu Gupta has lived in India’s financial capital Mumbai nearly his whole life, since arriving as a child from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.\nBut when polls open in the city, the 59-year-old street vendor won’t be able to vote in the nationwide election – along with millions of internal migrant workers who are a major backbone of the country’s economy.\n“I cannot go vote as I don’t belong to Maharashtra state,” Gupta told CNN in Mumbai’s shopping district Dadar, standing next to the roadside cart where he sells shaved ice and cold drinks. “I have voting rights in another state.”\nUnder India’s election rules, eligible voters can only cast ballots in their constituencies – meaning those working outside of their state have to return home to vote.\nThat’s all but impossible for many out-of-state workers, especially underprivileged daily-wage workers in the unorganized sector. And it’s a huge group – one study estimates there were about 600 million internal migrants in 2020, making up 43% of the country’s nearly 1.4 billion population at the time.\nThese workers are often from poorer rural parts of India, in search of work in bigger cities. Even then, they earn low wages that are usually sent home to support family members.\nPerhaps nowhere is this starker than Mumbai – India’s richest city and the birthplace of the Bollywood movie industry. Often referred to as the “city of dreams,” Mumbai draws migrants from across the country hoping to find wealth and success.\nMore than 43% of Mumbai’s population were classed as migrants in 2011 during the last national census, according to migration think tank Knomad. Many come from states with higher poverty and unemployment rates such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and Gujarat.\nSigns of that diverse mix are everywhere in Mumbai – the varied languages spoken, the many day laborers across the city, from auto-rickshaw drivers to construction workers and sugarcane juice vendors lining the streets.\nFor these workers, forgoing daily wages to head home to vote would come at a high cost – both in the money they would spend getting there, and lost wages. And those losses have a ripple effect on the family members back home dependent on their income – from children missing out on tuition fees to elderly parents’ rent and food costs.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic only underscored the volatility of migrant workers’ circumstances when millions lost their jobs almost overnight and were forced to go home.\n“Despite the living expenses being relatively high in large cities as compared to villages, their wages are considerably low causing poor living conditions including limited or non-existent public services such as water and sanitation,” said one United Nations-led study that examined the impact of the pandemic on this segment of the workforce.\nGupta said his shaved ice business relies on the hot summer months when the election takes place. “If I go to vote, I lose my business. Earning my living is more important to me than voting as I have to support my family,” he said.\n“There are many migrants like me who are in Mumbai to earn money and are not able to vote.”\nMany Indian citizens abroad – part of the massive global Indian diaspora – face the same problem, though their circumstances vary considerably.\nRelated article\nBillions spent, jungle-trekking poll workers and voting at 15,000 feet. What to know about the world’s biggest election\nMost are low-income laborers who helped build the economies and glittering cities of oil-rich Arab nations, while some are middle or upper-class students pursuing an international education or professional career in Western countries.\nAccording to government figures, there are 13.6 million such “non-resident Indians,” or NRIs, globally. The biggest group is in the United Arab Emirates, with 3.4 million NRIs, followed by 2.5 million in Saudi Arabia; next is the United States with 1.2 million.\nThe plight of NRIs in Gulf nations – many of whom live in cramped dormitories and labor camps – was also highlighted during the pandemic when businesses shut down, wages dried up and border restrictions prevented them from returning home, leaving them in limbo.\nFor these overseas Indians, there is no such thing as online voting or postal ballots. Instead, NRIs must register as an “overseas voter” then travel to their hometown in India to be physically present in their constituencies to vote.\nLocal media reports highlight some dedicated voters with the means to fly back and vote, such as professionals in the United Kingdom or Dubai. But they remain a tiny minority of NRIs who do so.\nAccording to the Election Commission of India, in the last national elections in 2019, more than 71,000 people registered as “overseas voters” – less than 1% of the total NRI population at the time.\nIndian authorities have pushed hard in recent years to increase turnout, urging all 968 million eligible voters nationwide to cast their ballots – a massive feat that includes setting up more than a million polling stations from remote forests to mountain peaks.\nThe ECI has also launched voter literacy initiatives and social media campaigns targeting young voters.\nThese efforts saw the highest voter turnout in the country’s history in the 2019 election, with more than 67% of Indians going to the polls.\nThe massive group of disenfranchised migrant workers stands in sharp contrast to these achievements – with no solution in sight.\nIn a 2011 study that surveyed workers across five Indian states, 60% of respondents had “missed voting in elections at least once because they were away from home seeking livelihood options.” It added that many migrants left home as young as age 13 to look for work – and did not have time to get their voter IDs when they became eligible at age 18.\nThe ECI acknowledged this problem in a 2022 report, raising the question of how to improve voter participation among internal migrants.\nOne issue the voting body highlighted was the absence of any clear definition of an internal migrant, adding that their inability to vote is a key reason “contributing to low voter turnout.”\nThe ECI said it had proposed remote voting machines to address the problem. But in 2023, the government said there were no such plans.\nThat means for now, voting remains an unlikely reality for many migrant workers.\n“I cannot say now whom I would vote for if I was in my hometown,” said Gupta, the Mumbai vendor. “That is the last thing on my mind – my focus right now is earning my livelihood.”\n",

        "content": "New analyses of the longest clinical trial yet of the weight-loss drug Wegovy are shedding light on how quickly it helps people lose weight, how long they sustain that weight loss and how safe the medicine is over four years of use.\nRelated article\nAt least 25,000 people in the US are starting weight-loss drug Wegovy each week, drugmaker says\nThe analyses – of a trial called Select, whose results showed last year that Wegovy significantly reduced heart risk in addition to helping with weight loss – also suggest that the drug may protect the heart in ways beyond weight loss alone, researchers said, raising new questions about how the wildly popular medicines in this drug class should be used – and covered by insurers.\n“The implications are profound,” said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist and scientist at Yale University and Yale New Haven Hospital who was not involved in the research, noting that a second study this week showed a similar finding for heart failure. “We have not encountered a drug with such a breadth of heart benefits.”\nMore than 25,000 people in the US are starting Wegovy every week, drugmaker Novo Nordisk said this month. And in a KFF poll released Friday, 6% of respondents said they were currently using a drug in this class, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists. That translates to more than 15 million Americans.\nOne important question about these blockbuster medicines is how widely – and how long – they’ve been studied. The Select trial, which was funded by Novo Nordisk, showed last year that Wegovy reduced the risk of a heart attack, stroke or heart-related death by 20% in people with existing cardiovascular risk with obesity or who are overweight. It included more than 17,600 people from 41 countries between 2018 and 2021 and followed them for several years.\nResearchers have continued to mine the data, and the new analyses, presented Monday at the European Congress on Obesity and published in the journal Nature Medicine, show results for people taking Wegovy as long as four years. Here are some major takeaways:\nThe analysis showed an average weight loss of just over 10% for people who used semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy, compared with 1.5% for study participants who got a placebo. The researchers, led by Dr. Donna Ryan of Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, noted that the trend showed that participants on the medication typically lost weight for about 65 weeks, or a year and three months, before reaching a plateau.\nA previous clinical trial showed even greater average weight loss for Wegovy: about 15% on average over 68 weeks, compared with 2.4% for people who got a placebo. The researchers on the new analysis noted that, in addition to some differences in the people who enrolled in each trial, the previous study was designed specifically for weight loss and included more structured lifestyle interventions about diet and exercise compared with the Select trial, which was designed to test whether the drug prevented cardiac events.\nThe results showed that the 10% average weight loss for people using Wegovy was sustained for up to 208 weeks, or four years.\nPatients stayed on the medicine while they sustained the weight loss. Other studies have shown that many people regain weight after stopping the drugs, including one published in December from Novo Nordisk competitor Eli Lilly: People using the GLP-1 drug Zepbound, which uses the active ingredient tirzepatide and targets a second hormone called GIP, lost an average of 21% of their body weight over 36 weeks. The participants were then split into two groups, and those who stayed on the medicine lost an additional 5.5% of their body weight, while those who unknowingly switched to a placebo regained 14% of their weight.\nHowever, not everybody regained so much weight. The study also looked at how many people maintained at least 80% of the weight loss after the initial 36 weeks, and while many more who continued on the drug did – almost 90% - almost 17% of people who were switched to a placebo maintained that much weight loss without the drug.\nIn the new analysis, the researchers reported that after two years, about 68% of people taking Wegovy had lost at least 5% of their body weight, while 21% of people on a placebo did. Almost 23% of people on Wegovy lost at least 15% of their body weight, compared with 1.7% on a placebo. And almost 5% of people on the drug lost more than 25% of their body weight, compared with 0.1% on placebo, showing that the top-line findings from studies are just averages; everyone has a different experience with medicines.\nOverall, more people on Wegovy decided to stop participating in the trial because of side effects than people who got a placebo: 17% of those on the drug versus 8% on placebo, a result that was previously reported. And the side effects were ones that are widely known with these medicines: mainly gastrointestinal disorders like nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and constipation, which usually affected people in the first few months of the study as the dose of the medicine increased.\nThe researchers noted that there were no new safety signals seen in the latest analyses. Acute pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas, wasn’t seen at a higher rate among those on Wegovy than placebo, although gallbladder disorders like gallstones were: 2.8% for people on Wegovy, compared with 2.3% for people on placebo. Both are included in warnings in the drug’s prescribing information because they’d been seen previously in trials.\nA key question when the full results of the Select trial were initially presented was whether the 20% reduction in heart risk was driven by weight-loss alone or some other protective effect of the drug. The new analysis suggests that there is something else at play.\nThat’s because the reduction in risk of heart attack or other events was seen even in people using Wegovy who didn’t lose weight.\nRelated article\nWeight-loss drug Wegovy offers benefits for people with diabetes and common form of heart failure, study finds\n“You probably don’t even need to lose weight to get the cardiovascular benefit” with semaglutide and similar medicines, said Dr. Daniel Drucker, a pioneer of research into GLP-1 at the University of Toronto who wasn’t involved in the new analyses. “That’s because that’s what GLP-1 does: It’s cardio-protective, at least in animals, independent of whether or not you have diabetes, independent of whether you have obesity, and you don’t require weight loss – it’s not the whole story.”\nAn analysis led by John Deanfield of University College London found that the reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in the study for those on Wegovy, compared with placebo, was similar among people who lost 5% or more of their body weight and those who lost less than that or even those who gained weight.\n“This suggests alternative mechanisms of improved cardiovascular outcome beyond reduction in adiposity,” or body fat, the researchers concluded.\nA separate study published Monday about heart failure, for which Wegovy has shown a major benefit, suggested the same thing, Krumholz said.\n“These two studies show that these anti-obesity medications are also heart-health drugs,” he wrote in an email. “The benefits to the heart for people with established cardiovascular disease or a certain type of heart failure occur regardless of the amount of weight loss.”\nDrucker suspects that GLP-1 drugs provide these kinds of benefits by reducing inflammation.\n“We can’t ignore the reduction in blood pressure or triglycerides, and the reduction in body weight must help a little bit, and glucose must help a little as well,” he said.\nBut based on his lab’s research, he said, “one of my favorite theories is inflammation, because we know that people with cardiovascular disease do have increased inflammation in their blood vessels and in the heart.”\nSign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\nDrucker said studies have shown that GLP-1 drugs tamp down harmful inflammation, which his lab is studying. He even noted that he receives communications from people with conditions like Covid-related brain fog, ulcerative colitis and arthritis – driven by inflammation – who think their symptoms have improved while using GLP-1 medicines. Those links would need to be borne out in clinical studies to be considered definitive.\nThe results in the Select trial, he said, raise the question of whether people who don’t have obesity or aren’t overweight but who have had a heart attack or stroke could benefit from taking a drug like Wegovy to prevent another event – another thing that would need to be studied.\nAnd, Drucker said, the results suggest that insurers should cover the medicines, which cost about $1,000 per month or more without it, more widely.\n“We probably really need to rethink these criteria for reimbursing the medicines, because they are not going to be helpful in terms of actually improving health and saving lives and saving health care dollars,” he said. “You don’t even need to lose weight to have a reduction in heart attack, strokes and death.”\n",

        "content": "Move over Met Gala. On Saturday, stars gathered on the steps of The Music Center in Los Angeles for the Gold Gala — a celebration of Asian Pacific influential talent across entertainment, fashion, technology and more, hosted by the non-profit Gold House.\nAnd they were dressed to represent — many proudly embracing Asian designers and cultural heritage through their red carpet looks.\nActor Karrueche Tran stunned in a striking red ao dai with a sheer overlay and headpiece by Vietnamese American fashion designer Thai Nguyen. “I knew I had to represent my culture, half of who I am, in a major way,” she wrote on Instagram. Tran has a Vietnamese mother and African American father.\nTaiwanese drag queen Nymphia Wind, who recently won “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” told CNN that her ensemble by Singaporean designer Sheng Cheong — a dress and cape featuring a bold print of neon yellow and white “laser cut clouds” — was intended to “reimagine what club kids would look like in the Forbidden City.”\nElsewhere, Bollywood filmmaker Karan Johar wore an ornately embroidered suit jacket by Rimple and Harpeet — an Indian fashion brand that specializes in handcrafted pieces inspired by ancient crafts and vintage textiles — and Indonesian singer Agnez Mo accessorized with golden hair pins and an elegant hand fan.\n“Anything goes here and that’s what is so celebratory,” TV personality Jeannie Mai told CNN of the event, which is sometimes described as the “Asian Pacific Met Gala.” “It’s the one place where you can really represent and be invited to do so.”\nThe glitzy affair honors the Gold House’s annual A100 list — one hundred Asian Pacific leaders who have made a significant impact on culture and society. Author and TV host Padma Lakshmi, actor Lucy Liu and the cast and creator of Netflix’s Emmy-award winning series “Beef” were among honorees.\nFor actor and comedian Joel Kim Booster, the significance of a gala feting so many people in the AAPI community, was not lost.\n“Events like this are so exciting to me because when I was coming up, I think there was a lot of energy like, there’s only going to be one of us in the room,” he said.\n“It’s so rewarding to be in a space like this where we’re all coming together and supporting each other. It’s not something that I grew up imagining I’d have for myself.”\nThere have been barriers across industries; in Hollywood, Asians have historically been underrepresented or stereotyped. But that has changed in recent years.\nA joint study by Gold House and the USC Annenberg found the percentage of speaking Asian characters in top box-office films in the US rose from 3.4% in 2007 to 15.9% in 2022. The roles themselves are more complex.\nThe age of streaming has also ushered in more opportunities for diverse and daring storytelling — on and off screen.\nFX’s Shogun, for example, became an instant hit when it premiered in February. Not only does it feature a predominantly Asian cast who speak mostly in Japanese — behind the scenes, Japanese experts in everything from samurai dramas to a “master of gesture,” were brought in to ensure authenticity.\n“I think what the industry has realized is that Asian creativity and Asian talent is a) different and b) lucrative. So that’s been wonderful to see people take chances, and how we’ve knocked it out of the park,” Lakshmi told CNN.\nMany acknowledge there’s more work to be done all around.\n“It’s an exciting time to see the Asian diaspora coming together to really tell our own stories, in our time, in our space,” said fashion designer and the gala’s creative director Prabal Gurung.\n“It’s great to see that visibility. There’s a long way to go still, obviously we feel that way. But progress is being made.”\n",

        "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\nScientists have accomplished a whale of a feat. They’ve identified previously unknown complexity in whale communication by analyzing thousands of recorded sequences of sperm whale clicks with artificial intelligence.\nVariations in tempo, rhythm and length of the whales’ click sequences, called codas, weave a rich acoustic tapestry. These variables hint that whales can combine click patterns in multiple ways, mixing and matching phrases to convey a broad range of information to one another.\nWhat sperm whales are saying with their clicks remains a mystery to human ears. Still, uncovering the scope of whales’ vocal exchanges is an important step toward linking whale calls to specific messages or social behaviors, the scientists reported May 7 in the journal Nature Communications.\n“This work builds on a lot of prior work focused on understanding the calls of sperm whales. However, this is the first work that has started to look at sperm whale calls in their wider communicative context and in the context of exchanges between whales, which has made some of the findings possible,” said study coauthor Dr. Daniela Rus, director of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT, in an email.\n“Understanding what aspects of their codas they can control and vary helps us understand how they can encode information in their calls,” Rus said.\nRelated article\nGreat apes tease each other just like humans do, says new study\nThe researchers dubbed their catalog of sound combinations a “phonetic alphabet” for sperm whales, comparing variations in the whales’ click sequences to the production of different phonetic sounds in human speech.\nBut while the team’s findings are interesting, that term offers a misleading perspective on whales’ vocal interactions, said Dr. Luke Rendell, a researcher at the University of St. Andrews in the United Kingdom whose work focuses on communication in marine mammals, in an email.\n“The presentation of the ‘phonetic alphabet’ — it’s nothing of the sort,” said Rendell, who was not involved in the research.\n“The way the tempo variation is used is completely different to how, say, we use elements of an alphabet to construct linguistic expression,” he said. “There’s no evidence of that, and it’s not a super helpful interpretation because it forces everything into a restricted and somewhat over-sold perspective of ‘is it like human language or not,’ when there are a much broader range of interpretations available.”\nSperm whales produce their clicks by forcing air through an organ in their heads called the spermaceti, and these sounds can be as loud as 230 decibels — louder than a rocket launch and capable of rupturing human eardrums — another team of scientists previously reported in the journal Scientific Reports.\nFor the new study, the researchers used machine learning to detect patterns in audio data collected by The Dominica Sperm Whale Project, a repository for observations of sperm whales that inhabit the Caribbean Sea. The recordings represented the voices of approximately 60 sperm whales — a subset of a group of about 400 whales known as the Eastern Caribbean clan — and the vocalizations were recorded between 2005 and 2018.\nPrior research had identified 150 types of codas in sperm whales worldwide, but the Caribbean whales used just 21 of those codas.\nThe scientists examined the timing and frequency of 8,719 coda sequences — in solitary whale utterances, in choruses and in call-and-response exchanges between whales. When visualized with artificial intelligence, previously unseen coda patterns emerged.\nRelated article\nThese snakes not only fake their own deaths, they use gory special effects to do it\nThe study authors defined four features in codas: rhythm, tempo, rubato and ornamentation. Rhythm describes the sequence of intervals between clicks. Tempo is the duration of the entire coda. Rubato refers to variations in duration across adjacent codas of the same rhythm and tempo. And ornamentation is an “extra click” added at the end of a coda in a group of shorter codas, Rus explained.\nThese so-called ornament clicks “occur more towards the beginning and end of turns” during vocal exchanges between whales, “behaving like discourse markers,” Rus said.\nThe discovery that whales could synchronize variations in coda tempo was “a really interesting observation,” Rendell said.\n“I am less convinced by the ‘ornamentation,’” he added. “It occurs very rarely, and I think we need more evidence that they aren’t just production glitches,” or filler sounds, “like when we say ‘um’ or ‘err.’”\nIn all, the program detected 18 types of rhythm, five types of tempo, three types of rubato and two types of ornamentation. These coda features could all be mixed and matched to form an “enormous repertoire” of phrases, the study authors reported. What’s more, meaning could be tweaked even further depending on the placement of a coda — following or overlapping other codas — within an exchange or chorus involving two or more whales.\n“Actually, many of us have been waiting for advanced technology to allow us to do something like this for decades!” said Dr. Brenda McCowan, a professor at the University of California Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, in an email.\nMcCowan, who was not involved in the research, was part of another team that, in 2021, conducted an interactive “conversation” with a humpback whale in waters near Alaska. For about 20 minutes, a curious whale repeatedly responded to a recording of a humpback song transmitted from the scientists’ boat.\n“This particular playback (with the humpback in 2021) was an opportunistic experiment with an inquisitive whale engaging us both behaviorally and vocally, and completely at her own volition,” McCowan said.\nRelated article\nA lone orca killed a great white in less than two minutes. Scientists say it could signal an ecological shift\nSuch interactive experimentation with whales, along with observations of whale behavior, could be an important part of unraveling the syntax of sperm whale click sequences, the authors wrote in the study.\nTheir machine learning method may also prove useful for studying other types of animal vocalizations, McCowan added.\n“Tempo, rhythm, rubato and ornamentation are likely to be found in other species of whales,” McCowan said. “We already know this is true of humpback song. But there is also evidence for this type of patterning in other aquatic, terrestrial and arboreal species to which this approach could be applied.”\nBut although this technique is helpful for identifying certain aspects of communication, it’s no Rosetta stone, Rendell cautioned.\n“Machine learning is great for finding patterns in large datasets,” he said, “but it doesn’t create meaning.”\nMindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine.\n",

Trump attorney Todd Blanche is expected to try to shred Cohen’s credibility with the jury during cross-examination by painting him as a convicted perjurer who has changed his story more than once.\nHere are the takeaways from Day 16 of the Trump hush money trial:\nThrough roughly five hours of testimony Monday, Cohen walked jurors through how he worked with former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker on Trump’s behalf during the 2016 campaign to kill negative stories; how he kept Trump apprised of his hush money negotiations with Keith Davidson, the attorney for Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal; and how Trump approved and was aware of how Cohen would be falsely repaid in 2017 for the Daniels payment as legal services.\nCohen is the glue that brings together the other witnesses the jurors have heard from so far, connected through text message email and phone calls to Pecker, Davidson, Dylan Howard, Hope Hicks and others who were allegedly involved with the hush money payments.\nCohen described his conversations with Trump during the Daniels hush money negotiations, which prosecutors backed up using Cohen’s phone records to show when the two had spoken. He also connected the payment to Trump’s campaign.\n“I had to get this done,” Cohen said on the stand.  “This would be catastrophic to the campaign.”\nAfter Cohen and Davidson agreed to a $130,000 settlement payment on October 11, 2016, Cohen said he tried to drag out the process until after the election at Trump’s direction – claiming he would need 10 days to get the money together and noting that the office was closed on Yom Kippur.\nHoffinger asked why Cohen did that.\n“Because after the election, it wouldn’t matter,” Cohen said.\n“According to who?” Hoffinger asked.\n“Mr. Trump,” Cohen said.\nDaniels got fed up with the delays, leading to Davidson briefly canceling the settlement agreement, before they renewed the deal at the end of October.\nThe day before Cohen wired the money, he had two calls with Trump the morning in which he said he told Trump he was going to open the account for the LLC that would wire the money to Daniels.\n“I wanted to ensure that once again he approved what I was doing because I require approval from him on all of this,” Cohen said.\nHoffinger asked whether Cohen would have gone to the bank without Trump’s approval.\n“No,” Cohen said. “Everything required Mr. Trump’s sign-off; on top of that, I wanted the money back.”\nCohen described how he lied on his bank statements – lies that led to federal charges against him in 2018 – by saying that Essential Consultants LLC was being used for real estate consulting.\nWhen asked whether his bank would have opened the account had he been truthful, Cohen said, “I believe that they probably would not.”\nTrump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records – 11 invoices, 12 vouchers and 11 checks – records that prosecutors say stem from the monthly reimbursements Cohen received in 2017 for the hush money payment he made to Daniels.\nOn Monday, jurors heard through Cohen for the first time evidence directly connecting Trump to those reimbursements.\nCohen described how he was furious in December 2016 when his annual Christmas bonus had been cut by two-thirds.\nHe said he immediately went to Trump’s then-chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, “and in some colorful language expressed to him how truly pissed off and angry I really was. This makes no sense at all.”\n“I was even for myself unusually angry,” Cohen said. “I used quite a few expletives.”\nAfter the new year, Cohen said he went to Weisselberg about getting repaid for the $130,000 payment. “Let’s do it,” he said Weisselberg told him.\nThe jury was then shown Cohen’s First Republic bank statement, which showed the $130,000 settlement payment and Weisselberg’s handwriting detailing how Cohen should be repaid $420,000.\nRelated article\nRudy Guiliani’s radio show has been cancelled after he repeatedly discussed false 2020 election conspiracy theories\nCohen testified that he saw Weisselberg write on the document, while telling jurors that his money would be “grossed up” to account for taxes, because he was being paid in monthly installments as income, instead of as a reimbursement.\nImportantly, Cohen said that after their meeting, he and Weisselberg went to Trump’s office to speak to him about it. Cohen said he was given the title of personal attorney to the president around the same time but wasn’t going to be paid for that title.\nHoffinger asked whether he was being paid for future legal services.\n“That was what it was designed to be,” Cohen said.\n“What was it actually?” Hoffinger asked.\n“Reimbursement of my money,” Cohen said.\nCohen, who used to say he’d take a bullet for Trump in the height of their relationship, testified Monday about everything he did to protect his former boss.\nAs Cohen described each media story he killed and nondisclosure agreement he locked down ahead of the 2016 election, it was always in the name of protecting Trump.\nWhen it came to the settlement agreement with Daniels, Cohen said he kept control of a document revealing the identities of “David Dennison” and “Peggy Peterson” so that he could protect Trump.\nAnd he testified that he used the Essential Consultants LLC to facilitate the payment to Daniels “to protect him and to isolate him from the transaction.”\nHoffinger asked Cohen whether he would sometimes bully people. Cohen confirmed he would.\n“The only thing that was on my mind was to accomplish the task to make him happy,” Cohen said of Trump.\nCohen also testified that it’s “fair” to say he was once Trump’s “fixer” and told the jury he’d sometimes lie for Trump – including to his own wife.\nCohen said he opted to front the $130,000 to Daniels from his home equity line of credit on his personal property because his wife would’ve noticed the large sum missing from their joint personal bank account.\nCohen painted Trump – whom he often called “boss” – as a micromanager who insisted he be kept informed of the ongoings of any situation, including the more discreet instances like the nondisclosure agreements with McDougal and Daniels.\nCohen admitted he also kept Trump constantly informed because he wanted credit for handling Trump’s matters, whether it was negotiating invoices or suppressing negative media stories.\nCohen said he always wanted Trump to know situations were handled and he wanted “to get credit for accomplishing the task.”\nUnlike his typical public persona, the jury saw a subdued Cohen who gave slow and deliberate answers on direct examination.\nCohen rarely looked over at Trump sitting at the defense table, training his eyes mostly on the prosecutor questioning him.\nAnd aside from reviewing some documents and passing a few notes to his attorneys, Trump spent the majority of the day with his eyes closed. The former president glanced up at Cohen a few times, but there was never an obvious moment of eye contact.\nCohen did prompt a few headshakes of what looked like disapproval from Trump, including when Cohen mentioned Trump’s wife, Melania.\nCohen claimed Trump wasn’t worried about his wife’s feelings when the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape went public before the election – testimony contrary to what former Trump aides Hicks and Madeleine Westerhout told the jury.\nHe testified, “‘Don’t worry, he goes, ‘How long do you think I’ll be on the market for? Not long.’ He wasn’t thinking about Melania. This was all about the campaign.”\nAt one point, it seemed like Trump had heard enough of Cohen’s devoted-employee story, shaking his head with a pursed-lipped smile when Cohen testified that he used a shell company to pay Daniels to protect Trump.\nTrump shook his head with a sarcastic smile when Cohen admitted he was disappointed he wasn’t considered for chief of staff when Trump took office.\nThroughout the four weeks of the trial, Trump has looked to having supporters at court – both on the streets outside of the Manhattan courthouse and within the confines of Judge Juan Merchan’s courtroom – and has complained about not having more support.\nLast week, Trump’s son Eric Trump; his senior campaign adviser, Susie Wiles; and Sen. Rick Scott of Florida all appeared in the gallery behind the former president.\nOn Monday, Trump had his biggest entourage of GOP lawmakers yet – including potential vice presidential hopefuls.\nSens. J.D. Vance of Ohio and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama were in court, as was New York Rep. Nicole Malliotakis from Trump-friendly Staten Island, and the attorneys general of Alabama and Iowa.\nThey joined Trump for the high-profile Cohen testimony, sitting in the gallery behind the former president at the defendant’s table. Eric Trump and attorney Alina Habba were also there to support Trump.\nThe Republican politicians stood behind Trump while he gave his new conference before entering the courtroom Monday morning. And after the first break of the morning, they went outside to give their own account to the cameras to denounce the proceedings they had just witnessed.\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n",

        "content": "Nobody has anything nice to say about Michael Cohen.\nDonald Trump’s former fixer and lawyer is expected to take the stand Monday as the key witness in the Manhattan district attorney’s case against the former president, prepared to give testimony connecting to Trump the $130,000 hush money payment Cohen made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election.\nThrough three weeks of testimony, jurors have already heard plenty about Cohen through numerous witnesses, who have painted an unflattering portrait of an aggressive, impulsive and unlikeable attorney.\nDavid Pecker, former head of National Enquirer parent company American Media Inc., said Cohen was “prone to exaggeration.” Former Trump aide Hope Hicks said Cohen liked to call himself a “fixer” – a role she said was possible only because “he first broke it.” And Daniels’ former attorney Keith Davidson said he only worked with Cohen because he was a “jerk” whom Daniels’ then-manager Gina Rodriguez – along with everyone else – didn’t want to deal with.\n\n“Gina called me up to tell me that: ‘Some jerk called me and was very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me. And I, um, would like you, Keith, to call this jerk back,’” Davidson testified in the third week of the trial.\n“I hate to ask it this way, but who was that jerk?” asked Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass.\n“It was Michael Cohen,” Davidson responded.\nNow Cohen is the witness whom prosecutors are relying on to deliver testimony that can help them prove Trump falsified business records when he allegedly reimbursed Cohen for the $130,000 to Daniels to keep her from going public about a past encounter ahead of the 2016 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied the affair.\nCohen is the only witness who will testify about Trump’s alleged involvement in both the decision to pay Daniels and the plan to reimburse Cohen for advancing the money. Cohen will likely serve as the narrator for the prosecution and take the jury from the initial meeting in which Pecker, Cohen and Trump allegedly agreed to buy negative stories that could hurt Trump’s presidential run to the payment made to Daniels just days before Election Day to an Oval Office meeting in February 2017, just weeks after Trump was sworn in.\nProsecutors allege that during the February meeting, Trump and Cohen agreed how Cohen would be paid back. That arrangement, prosecutors say, included a false story that Cohen was working under a retainer agreement. The paperwork, from the invoices and general ledger entries to the checks signed by Trump, make up the 34 criminal charges in the case.\nProsecutors have waited to call Cohen until the end of their case, after introducing phone records, emails, text messages and bank records that they hope bolster his credibility with the jury. They have not tried to hide from the jury that he and other witnesses have plenty of problems.\n“We are going to be very up-front about the fact that several of the witnesses in this case have what you made might consider to be some baggage,” Steinglass told a panel of prospective jurors during jury selection.\nThe testimony will pit Trump against Cohen, who once said he would take a bullet for the former president. They last saw each other when Cohen testified in Trump’s New York civil fraud trial last fall. Cohen’s testimony was brief, but the showdown was tense.\nThis week the stakes are higher, with a potential criminal conviction and possible jail sentence on the line for Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.\nIt brings to a close a long journey for Cohen, who is still aggrieved that he served three years in prison and home confinement after pleading guilty to federal campaign finance charges related to the payoff, among other crimes.\nCohen met with prosecutors more than a dozen times and testified before the grand jury in the hush money trial. He has immunity on state charges for his role in the alleged conspiracy.\nHe will also face blistering cross-examination by Trump attorney Todd Blanche. The former president’s lawyers are expected to hammer at Cohen’s credibility, including digging into his past, and suggest to the jury that Trump had no idea what deal Cohen struck or how it was recorded on the books of his company.\n“Even before he takes the stand, Cohen has been attacked and undermined by the prosecution’s own witnesses. On one hand, he could be damaged goods before he takes the stand. But he also might benefit from low expectations if the jury finds him to be better than advertised,” said Elie Honig, a CNN senior legal analyst and former state and federal prosecutor.\nThe charges filed against Trump date to events that transpired during the 2016 election. But in many ways, the case against Trump stems from his former fixer’s decision to plead guilty in 2018 in federal court to two counts of making unlawful campaign contributions in violation of federal campaign finance laws. He implicated Trump directly in the scheme and admitted that he orchestrated to pay Daniels on Trump’s behalf.\nCohen also pleaded guilty to tax charges and to lying to Congress about Trump’s business venture to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison, which he served behind bars and under house arrest.\nCohen’s plea prompted the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office to launch the investigation surrounding the hush money payments that led to Trump’s indictment last year.\nCohen became dedicated to antagonizing Trump. He published two books, “Disloyal” in 2020 and “Revenge” in 2022, and launched a podcast, “Mea Culpa” – all of which spent plenty of time bashing Trump and cheering on his prosecution.\nOn social media, Cohen continued to attack Trump in the weeks leading up to the trial, and even after it began. The social media jabs reached the point that Judge Juan Merchan told prosecutors Friday to give Cohen a message “from the bench” that he should stop speaking about the case. (Merchan has said he cannot legally gag a witness.)\nTrump has often punched right back in interviews and on social media, including in several instances that violated the judge’s gag order on the former president barring discussion of witnesses in the case.\nBeginning with the first witness in the case, Pecker, jurors have heard criticisms from witness after witness of Cohen ahead of his own expected testimony.\nPecker, who met with Cohen and Trump at a key Trump Tower meeting in 2015, was asked by Trump attorney Emil Bove whether Cohen was “prone to exaggeration.”\n“Yes,” Pecker said.\nBove then asked Pecker whether he could not trust everything Cohen said. The judge sustained an objection to the question, telling Trump’s attorney in a sidebar discussion that it was not the right place to “impeach” Cohen’s credibility.\nMore witnesses would keep doing so anyway.\nCohen’s former banker, Gary Farro, then testified that he was specifically given Cohen’s account because he could be firm with individuals who “may be a little challenging.” Farro said it was fair to call Cohen an “aggressive guy.”\n“Anything he did need, he called me, and it was always something that was urgent,” the banker said.\nArguably the most negative assessment of Cohen came from Davidson, who negotiated the hush money deal with Cohen on Daniels’ behalf in 2016. Davidson described a 2011 conversation about a blog post on Daniels and Trump on thedirty.com, where Cohen unleashed a “barrage of insults and insinuations and allegations.”\n“I don’t think he was accusing us of anything. He was just screaming,” Davidson said.\nDaniels’ former attorney went on to explain how he ended up involved in the hush money deal, when Daniels’ manager asked him to help finalize the deal for a nondisclosure agreement.\nAsked why he got involved, Davidson said: “The moral of the story was: No one wanted to talk to Cohen.”\nDavidson recalled under questioning from Steinglass that after Trump was elected in 2016, he got a call in December from a “very despondent and saddened” Cohen.\n“He said something to the effect of: ‘Jesus Christ. Can you f**ing believe I’m not going to Washington? After everything I’ve done for that f**ing guy. I can’t believe I’m not going to Washington. I’ve saved that guy’s a** so many times, you don’t even know.’”\nOthers who didn’t interact with Cohen as much as Davidson didn’t have much better things to say. Jeff McConney, the former Trump Organization controller, was asked what Cohen’s position was at the company.\n“He said he was a lawyer,” McConney responded.\n“Did he work in the legal department?” asked prosecutor Matthew Colangelo.\n“I guess so,” McConney said derisively.\nAnd Hicks, who worked at the Trump Organization before becoming a key aide on the 2016 campaign, described to jurors how Cohen – Trump’s fixer – was prone to inflate his influence on the campaign.\n“There were times where Mr. Cohen did things that you felt were not helpful to what you were trying to accomplish, right?” Bove asked Trump’s 2016 campaign press secretary.\n“Yes,” Hicks responded. “I used to say that he liked to call himself ‘a fixer’ or ‘Mr. Fix It,’ and it was only because he first broke it that he was able to come and fix it.”\n",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.\nMichael Cohen, the erstwhile lawyer and fixer of former President Donald Trump, was one of the first witnesses I interviewed as part of the first Trump impeachment: That was because I was investigating the identical 2016 alleged election interference now at issue in the former president’s hush money criminal trial.\nThe hard-charging Cohen had been by Trump’s side since 2006, had negotiated the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels to benefit the Trump campaign and was about to report to prison after pleading guilty in 2018 to campaign finance violations for that payment and to other crimes.\nI expected someone very different from the person I met, who was candid, remorseful and funny, if profane and possessed of a hatred of Trump. Cohen has never wavered since in the key details he provided me about the election scheme and its cover-up that will also be at the center of his testimony in Trump’s Manhattan criminal trial starting Monday. As we approach his keenly anticipated appearance, I think he, like Daniels did last week, will exceed expectations in how he presents to the jury.\nThe District Attorney’s Office has set that up with their work throughout the trial. They have methodically bolstered Cohen’s upcoming testimony with a series of credible witnesses and corroborating documents, gradually narrowing the universe of uncorroborated evidence that Cohen will provide.\nCohen will undoubtedly be the subject of a vigorous cross-examination that will likely include the many lies he now admits having told when he was associated with Trump, as well as Cohen’s guilty plea for perjury. But the prosecution’s effective strategy has significantly shortened the leap of faith the jury will have to take to believe him (as I did when I interviewed him).\nHere is how the prosecution has supported Cohen’s testimony in advance across three major aspects of the case.\nTrump’s intent was to benefit his campaign\nFirst, Cohen is expected to testify, based on his conversations with Trump, that the purpose of the payment to Daniels and the later alleged business record falsification was to benefit Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. The prosecution has already presented extensive evidence of this to the jury. For example, the former chief executive of American Media and the publisher of the National Enquirer, David Pecker, testified that he met with Trump and Cohen at Trump Tower in Manhattan in 2015 to hatch the “catch and kill” conspiracy with the explicit purpose of benefiting Trump’s campaign.\nPecker explained that for the scheme to further benefit Trump’s campaign, he later set in motion the hush money payment to Stormy Daniels. So when Cohen testifies that he discussed the payment with Trump and that his purpose included benefiting the campaign, that just represents the carrying forward of an intent that has already been corroborated.\nCNN legal analyst Norm Eisen is in the courtroom for former President Donald Trump’s Manhattan criminal trial and chronicling what he sees for this CNN Opinion series. Read previous installments:• You can’t deny the skill of Trump’s defense lawyers• The Trump team swung for the fences. Thanks to Stormy Daniels, they struck out• What Trump may not have expected from Stormy Daniels’ testimony\nTo take another example, the jury also heard evidence of Trump’s own words suggesting that the purpose of the scheme was to benefit his campaign. Former Trump aide Hope Hicks testified that when the Daniels scandal emerged in 2018, the former president told her that it was better to be dealing with Daniels’ allegation of a sexual encounter with him at that time, because “it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election.”\nHicks further testified that Trump admitted to her that he knew Cohen had paid Daniels. Trump claimed Cohen made the payment on his own and not at Trump’s direction, but Hicks did not believe him. She explained it was implausible that Cohen would have paid Daniels absent Trump’s instruction.\nThe Trump Tower meetings: Formulating the scheme\nCohen will likely testify about a second meeting at Trump’s office that took place between October 10 and October 28, 2016, with former Trump Organization finance chief Allen Weisselberg in attendance, where Trump agreed to pay Daniels the $130,000. According to Cohen, Trump said “it is not a lot of money, and we should just do it, so go ahead and do it.” Trump then allegedly directed Cohen and Weisselberg to “figure this all out.” The two allegedly met again in early January in Trump Tower to do that, and then confirmed it with Trump.\nKeith Davidson, Daniels’ former attorney who negotiated her hush-money payment, made clear during his testimony that he believed Trump was responsible for final approval of the funds. He testified that he was under the belief that Cohen needed Trump’s approval to wire any funds and that Trump was the source. Davidson maintained that he never believed Cohen was the ultimate source of the funds, affirming the money was expected to come from Trump or an associated corporate body.\nFormer Trump Organization accountant Deborah Tarasoff also told the jury that Trump was directly involved in reimbursing Cohen. Tarasoff detailed how payments shifted from the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust to being personally made by Trump in 2017, reflecting a deeper personal engagement. She recounted processing checks for Trump’s signature, including one for $70,000 signed by Weisselberg and Eric Trump and a $35,000 check from Trump’s personal account.\nThis evidence was pivotal in challenging the defense’s assertion that Trump was detached from the transactions, clearly showing he actively repaid Cohen, including during his time in the White House.\nRelated article\nHere are all the bad things witnesses have said about Michael Cohen, Trump’s former fixer who is set to testify Monday\nThe White House meeting: Reimbursing Cohen\nCohen is also expected to testify that he met Trump in the White House in February 2017, and there Trump again agreed to the repayment plan that Weisselberg had concocted. Trump then proceeded to personally sign checks to Cohen from the Oval Office for the rest of the year. The DA’s office has already elicited testimony that corroborates this meeting and reimbursement scheme and highlights Trump’s frugality and check-signing practices.\nFor example, Trump Organization controller Jeffrey McConney was able to testify to Weisselberg’s handwritten note — “I’ve been looking at his handwriting for 35 years,” McConney said, confirming he recognized it — that spelled out the exact repayment scheme that Trump used to reimburse Cohen for the hush money. This key physical evidence from McConney and Weisselberg, who may not testify himself, independently establishes the “grossed up” amount that Trump then paid Cohen after their February 2017 meeting.\nMadeleine Westerhout, a former Trump aide who sat just outside the Oval Office and had direct line of sight to Trump’s desk, was able to testify both to scheduling Cohen’s physical presence at the White House for the February reimbursement meeting and to Trump’s business practices early in his administration. She spoke at length about how Trump continued to focus on personal and Trump Organization business minutiae while in the White House.\nThis supports the notion that Trump would have, in the same time period, paid close attention to the $35,000 checks he was signing for Cohen. Westerhout also read aloud her email confirming, to Cohen the February meeting at the White House.\nSign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook\nLastly, Sally Franklin, a senior vice president at book publisher Penguin Random House, quoted from Trump’s own books and own words about his check-signing and other practices that corroborate Cohen’s story over and over again.\nFor example, in “Trump: Think Like a Billionaire,” a chapter titled “How to Pinch Pennies” contained Trump saying, “I received a check for fifty cents, and we at The Trump Organization deposited it. They may call that cheap; I called it watching the bottom line… As I said before, I always sign my checks so I know where my money’s going. In the same spirit, I also always try to read my bills to make sure I’m not being overcharged.”\nTo be sure, the defense will come after Cohen on cross with his prior lies in service of Trump, his perjury conviction and more. But because Cohen is so strongly corroborated, believing him will not require a leap of faith for the jury — more like a short hop. When that is combined with the brutally unfiltered, heart-on-his-sleeve person I first met back in 2019, you get a witness who may surprise us all, and certainly the jury, by exceeding expectations.\n",

        "content": "The changing language used by the Ukrainian military in 72 hours of daily updates tells the story: “Ongoing defensive fighting.” “Significantly worsened.” Russian “tactical success.”\nYou rarely ever hear Kyiv’s top brass sounding downbeat, but their steep southerly trajectory reflects the grave place Ukraine finds itself in. Russia is not just advancing slowly in one place; it appears to be advancing in four, across the frontline.\nMoscow knows it is on the clock: in about a month, the $61billion of US military aid will start to translate into Ukraine having the weapons it has been begging for. So, Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to be throwing whatever he can at it, knowing the fight will likely only get tougher for his forces in the summer ahead.\nFirst, and most acutely troubling, is the northern border near Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city. Russian forces have crossed the border in multiple locations and claim to have seized nine villages. Their move 3 to 4.5 miles (5 to 7 kilometers) into Ukraine, in the border area above Ukraine’s second city of Kharkiv, is arguably their fastest advance since the first days of the war. Russia has thrown five battalions at the border town of Vovchansk, Ukrainian officials said, which has been hit hard by airstrikes over the weekend.\nThe town of Lyptsi is at risk, say some military bloggers, and from there Russian forces could hit Kharkiv with artillery. This is a nightmare for Kyiv for two reasons: firstly, they liberated this land from Russian forces 18 months ago, yet failed, clearly, to fortify the area enough to prevent Moscow sweeping back with the ease with which they were swept out.\nAnd secondly, Russia can again tie up Ukraine’s over-stretched army with constant and grinding pressure on Kharkiv, exacting a toll with crude shelling on a vast urban center.\nRelated article\nShifting his fishing buddy sideways in the Kremlin, Putin chooses an economy expert for the war in Ukraine. Here’s why\nThen there is the rest of the front, where progress in Kharkiv region has been mirrored by old, exhausting fights suddenly seeing new Russian success. This should be the greatest cause for concern to Kyiv, as it suggests a coordinated bid to push in all directions and leave Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky with ugly choices about where to send limited resources, and where ultimately to sacrifice.\nMoving slowly south from Kharkiv, closer to Bakhmut, the town of Chasiv Yar has been under intense pressure – a valuable height above two key Ukrainian military towns, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, which could prove an exhaustive pressure point over the summer on Kyiv’s supply lines. Netailove and Krasnohorivka slightly further south show Russian forces making further gains to the west of Avdiivka, and threatening another key hub – Pokrovsk. If Ukraine begins to fall back further here, its grip on the remnants of Donetsk region could be at risk.\nAnd then overnight, Deep State Map, a Ukrainian military analysis group, said the southern village of Verbove was under greater threat – one of the minimal gains from Kyiv’s stymied summer counteroffensive last year. All across the board, the news is bad: it is a growing calamity.\nUkraine’s rhetorical response has been telling. Its leaders have, for once, openly said how bad it is. They appear to be shuffling commanders around – which is not something you do in the heat of battle without desperate reason. There is vocal criticism of the failure to prepare and fortify the northern border regions over the past year. Indeed, along much of the front line where there is not active fighting, and in the near-rear to active frontlines, fortifications seem wanting, if not entirely absent. It may be that Kyiv believed so much in its counteroffensive last summer, that it failed to entertain the idea of bad news this summer.\nKyiv’s larger problem is global attention. Trenchant statements from European ministers, and even visits from senior Biden administration officials, cannot cut through the fatigue or the notion that helping Ukraine win is something governments see they strategically must do, rather than something their publics actively demand. It is becoming a war the world wishes would go away – side-lined by the horrors of the Middle East – exactly when its outcome is most perilous and vital for European security.\nRelated article\nPutin replaces Russia’s defense minister with a civilian as Ukraine war rages and defense spending spirals\nPutin used the weekend to reshuffle some of his cabinet – moving Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to a more procedural role as National Security Council head, and perhaps further away from the wartime cookie jar. An accountant, Andrey Belousov, will take his place. But this is not necessarily a sign of retribution for failure, or a reset: the same old boys still get nice jobs. It smacks more of Moscow economizing, integrating the war more fully into the economy, and settling in for the longer haul.\nThe opposite is happening in the West, where the congressional dysfunction pausing that paused the US’s $61 billion in aid has already wreaked havoc on Ukraine’s military effort. Its forces are losing now because of that six-month delay in ammunition reaching them. Europe talks big about making up the gap, but it cannot. And Washington DC will now be in a whirlwind of electioneering ahead of the US elections in November just when Kyiv needs American certainty most.\nThe news is not just bad, it is worsening daily. The ground on the front lines is drying out, bringing us into the season to attack. Russia has momentum unlike anything seen since March 2022. Ukraine is being forced to admit just how bad the situation is. Much of the world may be tiring of this war, but Putin is not.\n",

        "content": "Three bewildered children sit on the roof of a mosque in Baghlan province, northern Afghanistan, their eyes blinking away mud that covers their entire bodies.\nBeside them, a rescuer lowers their baby brother, 2-year-old Arian, to the rooftop, a sheet tied around his waist that was used to pull him from the raging floodwaters below.\n“Take it, let’s get take off the rope from his body,” the rescuer says on the video. “Bring his mother to hold him in her arms and be warm.”\nIn the past few days, at least 300 people have been killed in flooding in 18 districts across at least three provinces in northern Afghanistan, according to the United Nations’ World Food Programme (WFP), with at least 200 injured.\nVideos show raging torrents of mud washing away mud houses – and people, their limbs flailing, in the fast-moving brown current, as would-be rescuers watch from higher ground, beyond reach.\nThe rescued children, ages 3, 5 and 6, were among eight siblings who were at home with their parents in Folo, in the Bulka district of Baghlan, when the flooding hit.\nTheir uncle Barakatullah, son of Haji Wakil Besmillah, the local school headmaster, told CNN something ominous seemed to be brewing late last week when severe wind swept through the district and neighboring areas, enveloping everything in darkness.\n“Visibility was so poor that we couldn’t even see each other,” he said.\nThen the rain started falling gently during Friday prayers – an unusual event for locals, who say it doesn’t rain very often so high in the mountain region, home to around 10,000 people, he added.\nAs the rain got heavier, suddenly the situation “turned dire.”\n“People fled to higher ground, seeking refuge in mountains and hills. Unfortunately, some individuals who were unable to leave their homes fell victim to the floodwaters,” he said.\nAerial photos show belongings piled in plastic bags on rooftops, among them the hooded figures of women forced to cover their entire bodies even in times of disaster.\n“Women who were rescued are forced to wear mud-soaked garments, while even infants as young as 2 to 3 months old are clothed in similarly soiled attire,” Barakatullah said.\nIn Folo, more than 100 people are believed to have been killed, he said – mostly women and children.\nSome burials began over the weekend, but many more are already believed to be buried deep beneath mud.\nThe torrent swept away animals and farmland in an area already facing severe food shortages, according to Timothy Anderson, head of the WFP in Afghanistan.\nHe said the areas hit by floods had already been marked vulnerable to starvation after a difficult summer when searing heat brought drought.\n“It was already pretty grim. And now it’s catastrophic,” he told CNN.\nMost years, locals expect to see flash flooding, he said. But this year, it’s been far worse.\nThe loss of the homes and their land is devastating for survivors, who were already among some of the country’s most impoverished people, Anderson said.\n“When people lose a bit of livestock, that’s actually their livelihood,” he said.\nRoad access to the worst affected areas has been cut by floodwaters, forcing the WFP to use donkeys to send in supplies.\nWithin the first day, the WFP had distributed high energy biscuits and food for children. They’re also supporting local bakeries to supply free bread. In the next days, teams will start distributing food to feed families for a month – what happens next is unclear.\nAnderson said 17 joint assessment teams are being sent to the area, along with other UN partners. He said it’ll take four or five days for the teams to properly examine the impact of the floods on people, and their housing and infrastructure.\nThis latest natural disaster comes after drought in Afghanistan, and is being seen as an example of a climate crisis hitting those who have least contributed to rising global temperatures.\n“They’re not net emitters of carbon,” said Anderson of the WFP. “This is a subsistence agriculture community and society. So, they’re bearing the brunt of it, without having necessarily contributed to the issue very much.”\nHe said during the recent dry months, efforts had been made to help the community capture rainfall in dams and irrigation canals to sustain crops. Now those efforts have been washed away, posing another challenge.\n“The need is massive, not just in Afghanistan. The world is seeing the impacts of much larger, more severe events, whether that’s drought, rainfalls cyclones,” Anderson said.\nRichard Bennett, the UN’s special rapporteur on human rights in Afghanistan said the recent floods “are a stark reminder of Afghanistan’s vulnerability to the climate crisis.”\nAnd in a statement Sunday, Teresa Anderson, the Global Climate Justice Lead at ActionAid International, said: “The climate crisis continues to rear its ugly head.”\n“With the latest incident, Afghanistan joins a long list of Global South countries grappling with floods this year,” she said.\n",

        "content": "The Biden administration has assessed that Israel has amassed enough troops on the edge of the city of Rafah in Gaza to move forward with a full-scale incursion in the coming days, but senior US officials are currently unsure if it has made a final decision to carry out such a move in direct defiance of President Joe Biden, two senior administration officials told CNN.\nOne of the officials also warned that Israel has not come anywhere close to making adequate preparations – including building infrastructure related to food, hygiene and shelter – ahead of potentially evacuating more than one million Gazans are who currently reside in Rafah.\nIf Israel were to proceed with a major ground operation into Rafah, it would be going against months of warnings from the US to forego a full-scale offensive into the densely populated city. Biden himself voiced that warning in his most explicit terms yet last week, telling CNN’s Erin Burnett that the US would withhold some additional arms shipments to Israel if they were to take such a step.\n“The president was clear that he would not supply certain offensive weapons for such an operation were to occur,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters at the White House Monday. “It has not yet occurred.”\nAs the war enters its eighth month, US officials are increasingly questioning Israel’s approach to the war, including publicly suggesting it is unlikely to achieve its stated aim of destroying Hamas and eliminating its leadership.\nOn Monday, Kurt Campbell, the State Department’s number two official, said there have plainly been tensions between the two countries on “what the theory of victory is.”\n“Sometimes when we listen closely to Israeli leaders, they talk about mostly the idea of some sort of sweeping victory on the battlefield, total victory. I don’t think we believe that that is likely or possible,” Campbell said, in a seeming allusion to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s repeated references to a “total victory.” “We view that there has to be more of a political solution. That’s one of the reasons why the president’s team has been so engaged with the surrounding region,” Campbell said at the NATO Youth Summit co-hosted by the Aspen Institute.\nGoing “headlong into Rafah” could have dire consequences, Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned on Sunday.\n“Israel’s on the trajectory, potentially, to inherit an insurgency with many armed Hamas left, or, if it leaves, a vacuum filled by chaos, filled by anarchy and probably refilled by Hamas,” Blinken said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\nAnd though the US believes Israel will be unable to completely destroy Hamas, the administration believes Israel has achieved many of its initial war aims. State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said last week that Hamas has been “significantly degraded.”\n“You have seen their ability to launch the kind of attacks that they did on October 7 significantly degraded, if not completely eliminated,” he said. “They couldn’t launch an attack of that scale today.”\n“Their weapons production factories underground have been eliminated. Most of their battalion leadership in the north and in central Gaza has been eliminated. So Israel has achieved a great number of its military objectives,” he continued.\nIt remains unclear whether senior Hamas leaders are present in Rafah, but the US is continuing to assist Israel in its mission of trying to eradicate as many senior members as possible, including by providing significant intelligence assistance in trying to track down figures including Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’s leader in Gaza.\nAs Biden continues to call for Israel and Hamas to reach a temporary ceasefire and hostage release agreement, in private, senior US officials have not gone as far as to urge Israel to consider a permanent end to the fighting, according to the senior administration official. However, the Biden administration has been ramping up the pressure on Israel to start focusing much more in earnest on post-war Gaza plans – so far, to little effect.\nIsrael’s lack of interest on the so-called “day after” plans has been a source of growing frustration for Biden advisers, according to one of the senior administration officials, who went as far as to describe Israel as displaying the attitude of believing that post-war Gaza is somebody else’s problem to figure out.\nIn public and in private, this official said, Israel has offered no clear views on two major questions: post-war governance and who would oversee the strip’s security whenever the war eventually comes to an end.\nBlinken publicly called on Israel to engage more seriously on developing a plan for post-war Gaza over the weekend. So far, the engagement has been sorely lacking, Blinken said.\n“We’ve been working for many, many weeks on developing critical plans for security, for governance, for rebuilding. We haven’t seen that come from Israel,” Blinken said on CBS. “We’ve been working with Arab countries and others on that plan. We need to see that too. We have the same objective as Israel. We want to make sure that Hamas cannot govern Gaza again.”\n",

        "content": "On the rare days that the hills surrounding Port-au-Prince fall silent, people notice.\n“If you can’t hear shooting somewhere, the gangs are probably running low on ammunition,” a police source in the Haitian capital told CNN. “But when there’s a lot of shooting, they’ve definitely received a fresh shipment.”\nFor over two months, Port-au-Prince has been cut off from the world, its international seaport and airport shuttered following an explosion of gang attacks in late February. All major roads are blocked by gang checkpoints. For most people living here, there is no way out – and no way to bring in desperately needed food and medicine.\nEncircling the Caribbean nation is another closed perimeter, this one created by Haiti’s neighbors. The Dominican Republic has sealed the island’s shared border and airspace. The Bahamas has launched a naval blockade to keep Haitians from fleeing the crisis by boat; the UK has sent a warship to ward off anyone seeking refuge in Turks and Caicos, a British overseas territory; and the US state of Florida has increased marine and aviation patrols.\nAnd yet guns, bullets and drugs keep pouring in, crossing international waters and airspace to reach the embattled country – most of the firepower originating from the US.\n“Haiti doesn’t produce guns and ammunition, yet the gang members don’t seem to have any trouble accessing those things,” says Pierre Esperance, executive director of Haiti’s National Human Rights Defense Network.\nSince the start of the year, thousands of people have been killed in gang-related violence and hundreds kidnapped, including at least 21 children, UN figures show. Stopping the flow of guns to Haiti would likely have an immediate impact on the bloodshed, according to police and human rights experts.\n“We have to cut the gangs’ weapons supply lines. This is absolutely the most important thing now,” the police source told CNN. “Because when they don’t have bullets, their machine guns become nothing more than clubs.”\nAnd as a Kenyan-led multinational security support force (MSS) prepares to deploy to Haiti, starving the gangs of ammunition should be a top priority for the US, says William O’Neill, the UN Designated Expert of the High Commissioner on the situation of Human Rights in Haiti.\n“All of these countries that are contributing their young men and women (to the MSS), how can we make it safer for them to do their job? One way the US could help immediately and directly would be to really seriously crack down on the flow of illegal weapons,” he said.\n“The gangs have literally nothing else; their only currency is intimidation and fear.”\nEighteen months ago, the UN Security Council imposed an arms embargo on Haiti, which bans the export of weapons to anyone in the country other than the government. The US has also taken independent steps to crack down on illicit exports, appointing a regional coordinator for firearms prosecution in the Caribbean and a special unit to investigate transnational crimes in Haiti.\nYet the guns keep coming. In January, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) warned that Haiti-bound firearms and ammunition were being “routinely incorporated into outbound shipments at warehouses near seaports and airports” in Florida, citing interviews with US customs officials.\nRelated article\nGangs forced out Haiti’s government. This FBI ‘Most Wanted’ gang leader claims they’re liberating the country\nThe following month, Haiti’s gangs put their weapons to devastating use, taking the country hostage in an explosion of coordinated violence that forced then-Prime Minister Ariel Henry to resign, and led to the creation of a transitional governing council that has so far been mired in disagreement.\n“The planes have not stopped flying. There continue to be exchanges of both ammunition and arms across the border,” Sylvie Bertrand, the UNODC regional representative, told CNN recently, urging the global community to enforce the arms embargo.\nBut amid today’s chaos, experts say it is likely becoming easier than ever for the gangs to resupply, as they now control major routes and infrastructure to bypass official controls.\n“There are always weapons coming in. There are always bullets,” Vitel’homme Innocent, leader of the Kraze Baryé gang, told CNN in April, his masked entourage bristling with a globally manufactured assortment of firepower.\nWeapons experts who later analyzed some of CNN’s images from the encounter said they could spot weapons and accessory parts originating from Israel, Turkey, the Czech Republic, probably Brazil – and, overwhelmingly, from the United States.\nThe guns Haiti’s gangs wield are a mix of stolen and smuggled, and the United States is by far the main source of the latter, according to UN experts.\nFrom 2020 to 2022, over 80% of the weapons seized in Haiti and submitted to US authorities for tracing were manufactured in or imported from the United States, UNODC reported in January, citing the most-recent available tracing data.  They are typically purchased in the US from federally licensed retail outlets, gun shows or pawn shops through “straw man” intermediaries, the agency also found.\nIt’s all part of a phenomenon that experts in Latin America and the Caribbean call the “iron river” – a flood of guns bought in US states with lax gun laws, and then shipped across the region to criminal groups. The Mexican government, which has been outspoken about the issue, currently has a $10 billion lawsuit pending against several US gun manufacturers whose products, it says, arm powerful cartels.\nA senior agent at the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), which investigates the diversion of lawfully purchased guns to illegal ends, told CNN that Miami is a significant source of weapons sent to Haiti, which have historically been trafficked in small freighters by family networks.\n“Those are difficult to enforce because they’re not your typical commercial freighter… it’s relatively easy to conceal a small number of firearms in those shipments,” he said. Texas, Louisiana, and Georgia are also sources of weapons trafficked to the Caribbean, where the ATF has a specialized gun intelligence unit to track and stop such flows, he added.\nAsked whether the US was doing enough, he emphasized that combatting gun trafficking was a top priority. “It is a very high priority of the United States government and ATF’s role in that, to stem the flow of illegal firearms, whether domestic or international, and particularly places like Haiti where the rule of law is under extreme threat.”\nIn January, Joly Germine – leader of the gang 400 Mawozo – pleaded guilty to US charges over a gunrunning scheme that saw dozens of rifles, handguns and a shotgun purchased legally in Florida under false pretenses, and smuggled into Haiti.\nFrom above, traces of Haiti’s extensive smuggling networks come into focus: the scars of a clandestine airstrip in its sun-bleached Central Plateau, a dock jutting from gang-held territory into the still waters of the Gulf of Gonave.\nSea and air are the main means of transport for the guns and the drugs trans-shipments that fund more weapons purchases, experts say. And while Haitian authorities have seen some successes in seizing illicit cargo over the years, the dramatic peaks and plains of this “land of mountains” add difficulty for an already understaffed police force and customs agency.\nHaiti’s secluded and sparsely populated rural areas are ideal for landings and take-offs by small planes aiming to avoid observation. There are at least 11 known informal or clandestine airstrips in the country, according to UNODC, many originally built for humanitarian purposes following the country’s devastating 2010 earthquake.\n“Here, you don’t have anything around you. So, you just go, probably in the middle of the night, with a couple vehicles parked on each side of the improvised runway so the pilot can identify the area. They land, drop off or pick up stuff, and take off again all outside of Haitian jurisdiction,” a security expert in Port-au-Prince told CNN.\nThe sea is the preferred option for arms smugglers given the weight of their cargo. Haiti’s roughly horseshoe shape offers over 1,100 miles of coastline, a challenging distance to comprehensively patrol for Haiti’s coast guard.\nHaiti’s south in particular has emerged as a strategic location for smugglers, the UNODC reported in April, offering entry points for cocaine from South America, cannabis from Jamaica and firearms from across the region.\n“One popular method of moving illegal products involves “banana boats,” go-fast vessels that arrive at night, beach on coastal banana plantations, and are subsequently destroyed after unloading their cargo,” the UNODC report details.\nGuns and ammunition that arrive in the south are frequently sent onward to Port-au-Prince via the gang-controlled Route National 3, it also said, identifying the Mariani gang, Grand Ravine gang, and 5 Segond gang as “major players in the organization and distribution of arms, munitions and drugs.”\nIn 2022, 5 Segond group attacked Haiti’s largest flour mill. It would have been an incongruous target if not for its location, positioned right next to Port-au-Prince Bay with a large jetty to accept deliveries. Just about a mile inland lies a major highway, and in between the two is a massive warehouse; a perfect distribution set-up for any import entrepreneur.\nToday, the entire area is controlled by 5 Segond, with security sources telling CNN that they believe the mill has been taken over and no longer functions.\n“Izo has the jetty, so he has access to the sea. And boats keep coming in and out of that area, which again is completely controlled by his gang… and is kept under tight control, with barricades in the surroundings,” the same security expert said, referring to 5 Segond’s rapper frontman Andre Johnson, who often posts videos of gang members flashing guns and paramilitary gear set to music on social media.\nContraband arriving via secretive small boats and planes is just part of the picture. Last month, Haitian National Police and Customs agents seized more than two dozen firearms, including 12 assault rifles, and nearly a thousand cartridges from a shipping container that had arrived in Haiti’s northern city of Cap Haitien.\nDrugs and arms smuggling has a long history in Haiti, much of it facilitated through official channels by government agents and even, in one 2022 case, by a rogue Episcopal church staffer who allegedly hid guns and thousands of rounds in a shipping container reportedly labeled as church donations, before it was seized by customs agents in Port-au-Prince.\nCustoms officials trying to do their job on the front lines in Haiti can face threats to their lives. In 2018, local press reported that several customs agents at the Malpasse border crossing between the Dominican Republic and Haiti were burned alive after an argument erupted in the course of a cargo inspection.\nAllegations of smuggling and gang affiliations have also been made at the highest levels of Haiti’s government. Four former Haitian senators have been sanctioned by the US for alleged drug trafficking, as have multiple past presidents and prime ministers of Haiti for allegedly financing the country’s gangs. They’re part of what gang leader Innocent refers to as the country’s “oligarchs,” who historically created and armed local gangs to become their enforcers-for-hire as they profited from white-collar crime schemes.\n“As a Haitian human rights defender, I can’t say that all the responsibility for these guns is on the US – I think it’s the Haitian government too. They need to regain control of the port, they need to control customs. The problem is corruption,” says Esperance, the human rights advocate.\nRelated article\nHunger in Haiti is spreading amid gang violence, aid workers warn\nThat’s why, he says, the planned deployment of an international police force to restore calm to Haiti is destined to fail unless the US and global community also commit to fighting corruption, building frameworks for good governance, and closing legal loopholes abused by the country’s elite.\n“Now, of course, the government is completely destabilized, it’s easy for the gangs to smuggle weapons themselves. But how did they begin? Just two years ago, smuggling was going through official channels, and it happened that way because everyone was corrupt,” Esperance said.\nBertrand, the UNODC representative, also emphasized the importance of building up Haiti’s institutions as its new government takes shape. Her agency is working to strengthen the country’s customs authority and coast guard, for example, including providing much-needed equipment from protective gear to cargo scanners.\n“It’s time for people in Haiti to live peacefully – for their kids to go back to school, for them to be able to eat every day.” And that means, she says, ensuring that “national authorities are well-trained, well-equipped, and ready to face and curb down the level of violence.”\nCNN reached out to Homeland Security Investigations, part of the US Department of Homeland Security; the US Department of Commerce’s Office of Export Enforcement, Haiti’s National Police and Haiti’s General Customs Administration for comment.\n",

        "content": "Acclaimed Iranian filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof says he has fled his home country to an undisclosed location in Europe after a court in Iran sentenced him to prison on national security charges.\nRasoulof condemned the Iranian government in an Instagram post on Monday, calling it a tyrannical and oppressive regime, and posting a video that showed him crossing the country’s mountainous border.\n“If geographical Iran suffers beneath the boots of your religious tyranny, cultural Iran is alive in the common minds of millions of Iranians who were forced to leave Iran due to your brutality and no power can impose its will on it. From today, I am a resident of cultural Iran,” he said.\nIn a separate statement dated May 12, Rasoulof said he had decided to escape Iran after his lawyers told him his prison sentence would be implemented on short notice.\n“I had to choose between prison and leaving Iran. With a heavy heart, I chose exile,” he said in that statement, which was provided by a spokesperson.\nCNN has reached out to Iranian authorities for comment. His lawyer Babak Paknia said last week that an Iranian court had sentenced Rasoulof to eight years in prison and flogging after it found his films and documentaries to be “examples of collusion with the intention of committing a crime against the security of the country.”\nRasoulof is among several high-profile artists to have been caught up in a widening crackdown on dissent by Iranian authorities since nationwide protests broke out over the 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini, who was arrested for allegedly not wearing her headscarf properly.\nRasoulof, whose recent films have been critical of the Iranian government, was among a group of artists and filmmakers who signed a letter criticizing the violent response of security forces to quell a 2022 protest over a building collapse in the southwestern city of Abadan that killed more than 40 people.\nRasoulof won a Golden Bear for best film at the Berlinale festival in 2020 for “There Is No Evil” and his film “A Man of Integrity” was recognized for a “Certain Regard” honor at the Cannes Film Festival in France in 2017.\nRelated article\nIran sentences renowned director to 8 years in prison and flogging, lawyer says\nThe filmmaker’s latest work, “The Seed of the Sacred Fig,” is set to premiere at Cannes next week, but it’s unclear if he will be able to attend.\n“We are very happy and much relieved that Mohammad has safely arrived in Europe after a dangerous journey,” said Jean-Christophe Simon, the distributor for Rasoulof’s latest film.\nThe Films Boutique and Parallel45 executive added that he hopes that Rasoulof will be able to attend the Cannes premiere for his film “in spite of all attempts to prevent him from being there in person.”\nRasoulof said on Instagram that he will now work to quickly finish the last technical steps of his film’s post-production.\n“Many people helped to make this film. My thoughts are with all of them, and I fear for their safety and well-being,” he said, accusing the Iranian government of pressuring members of his production team with interrogations, court filings and travel restrictions.\nRasoulof didn’t specify how he escaped Iran, saying only that he did it secretly with the help of friends and acquaintances.\nIn 2022, an Iranian court sentenced Rasoulof to one year in prison and banned him from making films for two years on the charge of “propaganda against the system,” according to Human Rights Watch. Iranian authorities have previously arrested him multiple times and confiscated his passport because of his work, HRW said.\nAdditional reporting by Michael Rios\n",

        "content": "A Chinese citizen journalist who has been behind bars for four years over her reporting on the initial Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan is due to be released Monday after serving her sentence, according to supporters and a court verdict.\nZhang Zhan, a former lawyer, was one of the few independent Chinese journalists reporting in Wuhan after the metropolis of 11 million people went into a complete lockdown, offering a rare, unfiltered glimpse into the reality on the ground as Chinese authorities imposed tight censorship on media coverage.\nShe was detained in May 2020 and sentenced months later to four years in prison for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” – a charge commonly used by the Chinese government to target dissidents and human rights activists.\nZhang is due to finish her sentence on Monday, according to the court verdict on her case obtained and published by human rights groups.\nSupporters and rights groups have called on the Chinese government to free Zhang on schedule.\n“So far I have not received any confirmation that Zhang Zhan has left the prison and is home with her family. We are all still waiting,” said Jane Wang, a UK-based advocate for the Free Zhang Zhan campaign.\n“I understand that her parents and brother have been under enormous pressure and warned severely not to give media interviews. Friends’ calls are also left without answers… these are extremely worrying signs,” she added.\nReporters Without Borders (RSF), which awarded Zhang its Press Freedom Award in 2021, called on “the international community to put pressure on the authorities to ensure her unconditional release on Monday,” in a post on social platform X Friday.\nRelated article\nThis Chinese virologist shared crucial Covid-19 data. Then his research hit hurdles\nIn early February 2020, just days after Wuhan went into lockdown, Zhang traveled some 400 miles from Shanghai to the central Chinese city to report on the spread of the virus and subsequent attempts to contain it, just as authorities tightened censorship on state-run and private Chinese media.\nFor more than three months, she documented snippets of life under lockdown in Wuhan and the harsh reality faced by its residents, from overflowing hospitals to empty shops, as the world braced for the spread of the virus. She posted her observations, photos and videos on WeChat, Twitter and YouTube – the latter two of which are blocked in China.\n“I can’t find anything to say because everything is covered up. This is the problem this country is facing now: any opposing opinions from us might be (dismissed as) ‘rumors,’” she said in a video two weeks after arriving in Wuhan, donning a face mask.\n“Even our own voices are out of our control. They imprison us in the name of pandemic prevention and restrict our freedom…If we cannot obtain the truth, if we cannot break their monopoly of the truth, the world will be meaningless to us.”\nHer posts came to an abrupt stop in mid-May, and she was later revealed to have been detained by police and brought back to Shanghai.\nChina’s Foreign Ministry declined to confirm whether Zhang had been released from prison at a regular news conference on Monday afternoon.\n“I don’t know the relevant information, but what I can tell you is that China is a country governed by the rule of law. Anyone who violates the law should be punished by law,” said ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin.\n“At the same time, China fully protects the legal rights of defendants and prisoners in accordance with the law,” he added.\nHuman rights advocates who have long worked on China say Zhang is likely to live under close surveillance from authorities even if she does walk out of prison.\n“While Zhang is released from prison, it won’t mean she will be free,” said Yaqiu Wang, research director for China at advocacy group Freedom House.\n“If the Chinese government’s past record is of any indication, she will face continued harassment and surveillance by authorities. But if Zhang Zhan’s past actions are any indication, she will keep fighting against efforts to silence her.”\nSarah Brooks, Amnesty International’s China director, said she was concerned that Zhang’s ability to travel or to make contact with relatives and others, especially those outside China, may be severely restricted.\n“Zhang Zhan should never have been jailed in the first place; now, having served her time, our hopes are with her and her family for a safe reunion and road back to health and, if she chooses, her important human rights work,” she said.\n“The Chinese government’s jailing of Zhang Zhan has been a shameful assault on her human rights, and her release must mark a new beginning.”\nSupporters and rights groups are also concerned about Zhang’s access to medical treatment upon her release, given her poor health conditions while in prison.\nThe 40-year-old has been on multiple hunger strikes since being detained and was briefly hospitalized. In 2021, Zhang’s mother said her daughter was so frail that she could not hold her head up for lack of strength and was in desperate need of medical care.\nDuring a previous hunger strike, Amnesty International alleged Zhang was shackled and force fed, treatment the group said amounted to torture.\nChina’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not previously respond to CNN on allegations of Zhang’s mistreatment in detention.\nIn a lengthy statement issued in July 2020, the Foreign Ministry denied the Chinese government had cracked down on journalists who “exercised their right to freedom of speech on the Internet” during the pandemic.\n“In China, no one gets punished or penalized simply because of making remarks,” the statement said. “The Chinese government has all along conducted its Covid-19 response in an open and transparent manner, and has made widely recognized achievements.”\nZhang was one of a number of independent reporters who were detained or disappeared during the outset of the pandemic, as Chinese authorities clamped down on coverage of the virus and propaganda outlets went into overdrive portraying Beijing’s response as effective and timely.\nChina is the biggest jailer of journalists in the world, according to Reporters Without Borders, which ranks it at 172 out of 180 countries around the world in its annual Press Freedom Index.\nAuthorities tightly control the press at home while blocking most foreign media outlets via the Great Firewall, its vast online censorship and surveillance apparatus.\n",

An eruption in December killed 23 climbers and spewed ash as high as 3,000 meters (9,843 feet) into the air, covering entire towns, roads and vehicles in the surrounding areas.\nMount Marapi erupted again in January, during which Indonesian government authorities warned residents and visitors not to go within a 4.5 kilometer (2.8 mile) radius of the crater where the eruption took place.\n",

        "content": "Georgia’s parliament is set to pass a highly controversial so-called “foreign agents” bill that has triggered widespread protests across the former Soviet republic nestled in the Caucasus Mountains.\nTens of thousands of people in capital city Tbilisi have been protesting the legislation. Critics warn that it mirrors a foreign agents law already passed in Russia and could jeopardize Georgia’s bid to join the European Union.\nBut Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze has said the government is not planning any “substantial changes” to the bill, and has vowed to get it passed on Tuesday, when lawmakers in the former Soviet country are expected to vote.\nHere’s what you need to know about the proposed law and the uproar it has caused.\nThe bill would require organizations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as “agents of foreign influence” or face crippling fines.\nThe legislation was drafted by the Georgian Dream party, which along with its allies controls parliament. The proposal will receive a vote on Tuesday and it is expected to pass.\nGeorgia President Salome Zourabichvili called the bill “an exact duplicate” of its Russian counterpart in an interview with CNN.\nShe has vowed to veto the bill, but that won’t mean much. Georgia’s government is a parliamentary system, so Zourabichvili is effectively a figurehead. Real power lies with Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze. Georgian Dream’s billionaire founder, former Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, also wields significant political influence.\nA couple of reasons.\nThe proposed law is modeled after a similar one in Russia that the Kremlin has used to increasingly snuff out opposition and civil society. Many Georgians fear their foreign agents bill will be used to the same way it has been in its northern neighbor: to quash dissent and free expression by going after nongovernmental organizations with financial ties overseas.\nGeorgian Dream contends the legislation will promote transparency and national sovereignty and has hit back at Western criticism over the proposal.\nBut the law’s possible passage has touched on a more existential question: whether Georgia’s future lies with Europe or Russia.\nGeorgia has, like Ukraine, been caught between the two geopolitical forces since achieving independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.\nMany Georgians feel deep hostility toward the Kremlin, which invaded Georgia in 2008 and occupies about 20% of its internationally recognized territory – about the same proportion that Russia occupies in Ukraine.\nGeorgian Dream has long been accused of harboring pro-Russian sympathies, especially given that Ivanishvili made his fortune in the Soviet Union.\nPassionately. So much so that lawmakers at one point came to blows over the bill.\nPolling shows that about 80% of Georgians support joining the European Union rather than drifting further into the Kremlin’s orbit, and many of those in favor of deepening ties with the West have taken to the streets.\nCNN's Anna Coren speaks to Giorgi Revishvili about Georgia's foreign agents bill, known to critics as the so called \"Russian law.\"\nRelated video\nExplaining the controversy surrounding Georgia’s foreign agents bill\nMass demonstrations against the bill in Tbilisi have been going on nightly for a month. About 50,000 people came out Sunday evening in the capital, which is home to about 1 million people, to speak out against what they’ve dubbed “the Russian law.”\nThere have been counter-protests as well. One saw the reclusive Ivanishvili deliver a rare speech to a crowd of supporters bussed in to Tbilisi from Georgia’s rural regions, where Georgian Dream enjoys more support.\nThe address showed deep paranoia and an autocratic streak. Ivanishvili claimed that Georgia was being controlled by “a pseudo-elite nurtured by a foreign country” and pledged to go after his political opponents after October’s elections.\nYes, just last year.\nGeorgia’s government tried to pass the same law but was forced into an embarrassing climbdown after a week of intense protests, which saw citizens waving EU flags buffeted back by water cannons.\nThe bill was reintroduced in March, about a month after Kobakhidze became Prime Minister. This time, authorities seem determined to push the legislation through.\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan wrote on X that Washington is “deeply alarmed about democratic backsliding in Georgia.”\n“Georgian parliamentarians face a critical choice – whether to support the Georgian people’s Euro-Atlantic aspirations or pass a Kremlin-style foreign agents’ law that runs counter to democratic values,” he said. “We stand with the Georgian people.”\nThe Kremlin has claimed that the law was being used to “provoke anti-Russian sentiments,” adding that protests against it were being stirred by “outside” influences.\n“This is now the normal practice of a huge number of states that are doing everything to protect themselves from outside influence, from foreign influence on domestic politics. And all countries are taking action in one form or another, but all these bills have the same goal,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in April. “Once again, there is no way to link this bill and the desire to secure Georgia’s internal politics with some kind of Russian influence; this is not the case.”\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement earlier this month that she was following the developments in George with “great concern” and reiterated Brussels’ unease over the law.\n“Georgia is at a crossroads. It should stay the course on the road to Europe,” she said.\nDefinitely.\nGeorgia first applied for EU membership in 2022 and was granted candidate status in December, an important but still early step in the process of becoming a member of the bloc. However, Brussels said last month that the law’s passage would “negatively impact” Georgia’s path to EU membership\n“Georgia has a vibrant civil society that contributes to the country’s successful progress towards EU membership. The proposed legislation would limit the capacity of civil society and media organizations to operate freely, could limit freedom of expression and unfairly stigmatize organizations that deliver benefits to the citizens of Georgia,” EU officials said.\n“The EU urges Georgia to refrain from adopting legislation that can compromise Georgia’s EU path, a path supported by the overwhelming majority of Georgian citizens.”\nCNN’s Anna Chernova contributed to this report.\n",

As Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan touched down at both cities’ airports, folk dancers performed on the tarmac and, in contrast to the subdued welcome the couple received in Paris, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban were on hand to greet them.\nChinese state media played up the warm diplomacy, with headlines proclaiming China’s “ironclad” bond with Serbia and “golden friendship” with Hungary. Both countries, major recipients of Chinese investment, announced upgrades of their relations with China during the visits – a symbolic win for Xi that analysts say could play a role softening European policy on China in fraught areas such as trade, security and human rights.\nBut in the rest of Europe, the red-carpet welcome afforded Xi by Vucic and Orban – both widely seen as illiberal and Russia-friendly – may not play as well, analysts say, and emphasizes the shrinking number of European capitals where Xi would meet such a warm embrace.\nChina-Europe relations have been frayed by the European Union’s growing list of economic grievances with China, which could yet spiral into a full-blown trade war. Also in the mix are suspicions across Europe about Beijing’s global ambitions and influence, especially over its support for Russia – including allegations it is supplying dual-use parts which help the Kremlin’s war against Ukraine.\nMaking his first visit to Europe in five years, Xi was pressed on these issues early last week by French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Both are sure to closely watch any summit between Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin in China, expected to happen soon.\nIn Paris, Xi stressed that China was playing no role other than “contributing to reaching peace” in Ukraine, and denied there was industrial “overcapacity” in China flooding the European market.\nSuch tensions vanished when Xi met Vucic and Orban.\nHis visits to Serbia and Hungary “send a very good message to a Chinese (domestic) audience that ‘we have close friends in Europe… Hungary and Serbia are real friends that we can do business with,’” said Philippe Le Corre, a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis, speaking at an event hosted by the center as Xi’s tour got underway last week.\nBut the countries’ inclusion in his itinerary was “embarrassing” for Paris, because both Orban and Vucic attended the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing last October alongside Putin, Le Corre added.\nXi’s visits to Serbia and Hungary helped him toward another goal – chipping away at a world order he sees as dominated by the United States.\nWith the inking of a joint statement, Serbia’s Vucic became the first European leader to commit to joining China in building a “community with a shared future.” The loosely formulated concept calls for a collaboration on shared interests, suggesting countries shouldn’t interact based on alliances, or be judged on their domestic politics and human rights record.\n“That is the highest level of cooperation of two countries and I am proud that as a president of Serbia I had an opportunity to sign that declaration with President Xi,” Vucic said Wednesday of the accord, which came alongside a free-trade agreement and other pledges from Xi on expanding agricultural imports and direct flights.\nXi also marketed a shared worldview during his meeting with Orban in Hungary, which is a member of both the EU and NATO. Orban, whose increasingly authoritarian rule has raised alarm within the EU, defied mounting concerns within both blocs to upgrade his country’s relations to an “all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership.”\nRelated card\nChina has a sweeping vision to reshape the world – and countries are listening\nAs well as being another symbolic win for Xi, this could encourage Orban to push back against efforts within the EU to “derisk” supply chains and slap tariffs on Chinese goods, analysts say. Speaking in Budapest Thursday alongside Orban, Xi appeared to allude to that, saying he hoped Hungary would use its rotating EU presidency beginning in July to “promote the stable and healthy development of China-EU relations.”\nThe two leaders also signed some 18 cooperation agreements, which Orban said covered sectors such as railways, IT, and nuclear energy. Xi declared the two countries would “deepen economic, trade, investment, and financial cooperation” and advance “key projects,” including the Budapest-Belgrade railway.\nBoth Serbia and Hungary are already key destinations for Chinese investment, with Hungary emerging as an increasingly important production hub in Europe for Chinese automotive suppliers including electric vehicle (EV) makers. In France earlier this week, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told journalists that Chinese company BYD was “welcome” to open a factory in France; but the EV giant appears to have already chosen its first foothold for car production in Europe, pledging late last year to open a plant in Hungary.\nBeijing may also be hoping other countries on the continent take note, with analysts saying all this plays into Xi’s efforts to frame parts of Europe as benefiting from clearheaded views on China, versus others who are mimicking American efforts to contain it.\n“Being close to these countries fits China’s domestic narrative that there are ‘smart countries’ in Europe who really understand China and do not support the United States – and China is working with these countries for the good of Europe,” said Liu Dongshu, an assistant professor of public and international affairs at Hong Kong’s City University.\nBut Xi’s itinerary also underscores his limitations within Europe, others say, including in Central and Eastern Europe where Beijing previously made extensive efforts to deepen connections and win goodwill, including through Xi’s flagship Belt and Road infrastructure drive.\nA Chinese mechanism to bolster relations with 16 Central and Eastern European nations has slowly lost support, in part because investments didn’t materialize at the expected scale, and also because China’s support for Russia soured relations in a region with a recent history of Soviet domination.\n“The unlimited partnership and Beijing’s moral and material support to Moscow has infuriated many (Central and Eastern European) countries’ leadership and population,” said Tamas Matura, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis. “This has definitely weakened China’s position in Europe.”\nRelated article\nIn Europe, Xi looks to counter claims China is aiding Russia in Ukraine\nMeanwhile, longstanding tensions with Nordic countries and Italy’s exit earlier this year from the Belt and Road, as well as recent visits to China by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, meant none of those countries were ideal for Xi to visit, Matura added. France, he said, was likely seen by Beijing as creating a potential for a diplomatic opening given its advocacy for Europe’s strategic autonomy from the US.\nBut there were few tangible signs from the trip that friction with Western European countries and the EU would abate, despite both Macron and Von der Leyen stressing the importance of dialogue and Xi’s two-day visit with the French president, which included a more personal trip to the Pyrenees and the signing of 18 cooperation deals.\nAnd despite their limited economic heft – with 16 million people between them, and a combined GDP about a tenth of France’s, according to IMF figures – Serbia and EU member Hungary may become increasingly valuable to Beijing as tensions with the bloc continue, and the threat of a trade war looms.\n“Orban and Vucic are both the kind of illiberal leaders who are positioning their countries between the rivaling geo-political blocs, hoping to avoid too strong dependence on any one of them,” said former Hungarian member of Parliament Gabor Scheiring, an assistant professor of comparative politics at Georgetown University in Qatar. “They don’t care about democracy or human rights. For them, foreign policy is strictly pragmatically about economic interests.”\nAnd that could be a boon for China.\n“Hungary and Serbia are strategic gateways for Beijing toward Europe…  the value of the two countries as gateways to Europe will increase as the trade war escalates,” he said.\nCNN’s Xiaofei Xu contributed to this report.\n",

        "content": "There’s nothing quite like settling back into your train seat, the urban skyline out the window fading into lush natural landscapes as you make your way to your next destination.\nAccording to rail experts, an increasing number of luxury travelers are looking to experience this sensation, all part of a global shift towards slower and more sustainable tourism activities.\nAnantara is among the hospitality giants now tapping into this demand, with the high-end hotel brand offering a new five-hour luxury train experience in southern Vietnam that connects the popular resort destinations of Na Trang and Quy Nhon – its second route in the country.\nThe first “The Vietage by Anantara” luxury train carriage launched in 2020 – a six-hour journey connecting Da Nang and Quy Nhon.\nAnanatara’s head of PR and marketing for Vietnam, Kate Jones tells CNN the new carriage heads in the opposite direction and aims to expose travelers to even more of Vietnam’s beautiful views. Like the first Vietage carriage, it will be attached to Vietnam’s state-run commercial railway that runs up and down the country.\n“The main difference is that the new route connecting Nha Trang and Quy Nhon passes through many more coastal areas than the journey between Da Nang and Quy Nhon,” says Jones.\n“There is a selection of really quite stunning bays and some striking coastline facing the East Sea. There are some mountainous areas and still plenty of rice paddies and lotus ponds, but the coastal scenery is the biggest view ‘pull’ for this five-hour journey.”\nThis is slow travel at its best – the trains hit an average speed of 51.9 kilometers per hour (32.2 mph) according to Anantara.\nThat gives guests on the Quy Nhon-Nha Trang route plenty of time to enjoy their complimentary afternoon tea set, which includes local caviar, Vietnamese artisanal cheeses, a selection of cold cuts and premium Vietnamese teas.\nFor the six-hour journeys between Da Nang and Quy Nhon, passengers are served a pre-ordered three-course gourmet meal.\nGuests on either route also get complimentary snacks, free-flow wine, cocktails, mocktails, teas, coffee and soft drinks, plus a 15-minute head and shoulder treatment.\nThe Vietage carriage is fitted out with a sit-up bar, restroom facilities and six private booths that seat two, each of which comes with power outlets, charging stations, free wifi and amenity baskets with pillows, blankets and other essentials.\nTravelers can reserve their seats online at Thevietagetrain.com, while those wanting to combine their rail journeys with a stay at one of Anantara’s properties – – Anantara Hoi An Resort, Anantara Quy Nhon Villas or Avani Quy Nhon Resort – can book packages through those individual hotel websites.\nThe cost of a one-way Vietage journey is $420 per person. The new route departs from Nha Trang Train Station at 2 p.m., arriving at Dieu Tri Station in Quy Nhon at 6:29 p.m. For those preferring to travel in the opposite direction, trains depart Dieu Tri Train Station at 2:15 p.m. - arriving at Nha Trang Train Station at 6:36 p.m.\nRelated article\nThis train route is being revived after over 100 years\nThe original route departs from Da Nang Train Station at 8 a.m., arriving at Quy Nhon’s Dieu Tri Station at 2:03 p.m. There is also an evening option that departs Quy Nhon at 7:00 p.m., arriving in Da Nang at 12:53 a.m. the following day. This Vietage journey is slightly cheaper, costing $315 per passenger.\nAs for demand, Jones says many are turning to rail travel rather than “rushing through airports to get from A to B.”\n“The domestic aviation industry in Vietnam right now is also facing some challenges with the disappearance of two airlines and a reduced fleet with the national carrier, so overall air travel is currently not popular, plus overly expensive,” she says.\n“The Vietage is the only experience of its kind in Vietnam and, of course, with the return of the Belmond train, the awareness of luxury rail travel is growing in Southeast Asia.”\nIn addition to traveling slowly and more sustainably, Jones says rail travelers gain real visual insights into the country, taking in scenes like “rural villages, fishermen casting their nets, farmers in fields with the water buffaloes – things you definitely don’t experience at 35,000 feet.”\n",

        "content": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.\nFor decades, Western companies made a fortune betting on the inexorable rise of the Chinese consumer. Now an economic slump and the emergence of ferocious local competitors means those bets look less safe as price wars erupt.\nDiscounts and special deals are being offered across consumer brands from food and clothing to consumer electronics and cars, reflecting a dramatic shift in consumption patterns in the world’s second largest economy.\nOne of the most intense price wars is raging in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, where a “life and death” race has manufacturers scrambling for survival.\nTesla’s China market share shrank to 4% in April, almost halving from 7.7% in March, according to data released by the China Passenger Car Association on Friday. Deliveries from its Shanghai factory, its largest globally, fell 18% last month from a year earlier.\nThe sharp drop contrasts with rising sales by its biggest Chinese rival BYD, which reported a 29% jump in pure EV deliveries.\n“Everyone has changed the way they think about China,” said Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder and managing principal at J Capital Research. “The business climate has changed entirely.”\nLast month, Tesla (TSLA) announced aggressive price cuts in the country, shortly after also reducing prices in the United States and Germany. The move added to a series of price reductions that it has made in its biggest overseas market since late 2022.\nLast year, the Chinese economy grew 5.2%. Outside the pandemic years, that was its slowest pace of annual expansion since 1990, when gross domestic product increased only 3.9% because of international sanctions following the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.\nConsumers have curtailed spending as their job and income prospects worsened. A prolonged crisis in real estate, which accounts for 70% of household wealth, and a stock market meltdown have added to their woes.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk makes a surprise visit to China, it coincides with Beijing's auto show where reports suggest he is trying to export his company's self-driving technology. CNN's Marc Stewart has more.\n\nRelated video\nElon Musk makes surprise visit to China, meets senior trade officials\nIn the 1990s, “every company in the West” was hiring consultants and having boardroom meetings about how to do more in China, according to Stevenson-Yang. But now the consultants are gone and rather than talking about how to tap into rapid growth, the C-suite discussions are all about “getting out, protecting one’s operations or balancing supply among several countries.”\n“China now is somewhere around the status of a Brazil — big, important but difficult,” she added.\nThe country’s economic woes aren’t confined to Tesla and the EV industry either. They’re hitting other American corporate giants like Apple (AAPL), Starbucks (STUX) and McDonald’s (MCD): all struggling to adjust their business strategies for a rapidly changing market.\nWorries about the future have forced Chinese consumers to be more budget-conscious, said Yang Wang, senior analyst for Counterpoint Research. As a result, purchases associated with premium or luxury have taken a back seat.\n“Certainly Chinese consumers are experiencing ‘downgraded consumption’ in general,” he said.\nApple’s overall revenue in Greater China — including mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao — fell 8% to $16.4 billion in the fiscal quarter ending March 30.\nMeanwhile, Huawei, a Chinese tech champion that the West once tried to kill off, has been advancing rapidly. Its smartphone sales soared 70% in the first quarter of 2024, boosted by the successful launch of its Mate 60 series, according to data compiled by Counterpoint Research.\nRelated article\nHuawei sales are soaring in China as Apple sinks\n“[China] is the most competitive market in the world,” said Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, at an earnings call with analysts earlier this month. He added that he continues to feel optimistic about the Chinese market in the long term.\nThe US smartphone maker has cut prices for iPhones sold in China, which helped its shipments jump in March, according to data published last week by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, a government-backed research firm. It marked a turnaround from the previous two months of 2024, when Apple saw a deep slump in iPhone sales.\nThe price reductions were led by Apple and third-party retailing platforms, with some iPhone 15 models offered at discounts of as much as 20%.\nCoffee chains have also scrambled to undercut each other’s prices. Last February, Cotti Coffee, a startup founded by two former Luckin Coffee executives, began a campaign to slash latte prices to as low as 9.9 yuan ($1.4).\nThe move prompted Luckin, which is the country’s largest coffee chain, to match that price. Cotti then slashed latte prices again to 8.8 yuan ($1.2).\nThe aggressive discounts have affected global brands. Even Starbucks, which had signalled it had no interest in a price war in China, started offering coupons that effectively lowered its latte prices to below 20 yuan ($2.8). They normally sell for 30 yuan ($4.2).\nRelated article\nIn China’s battle of the lattes, Luckin Coffee keeps beating Starbucks\nThe average check paid by a Starbucks customer declined 9% in China in the first quarter of the year, mainly because of promotions and lower sales of higher priced merchandise, the company said.\n“Our consumers are now more cautious in their spending,” said Belinda Wong, chairwoman and co-CEO of Starbucks China, on an earnings call in January. “You see mass influx of mass market competitors focus on fast store expansion and low price tactics to drive trial.”\nFast food chains have also gotten into the act.\n“Poor man’s deal” has become a trending term among Chinese youth since 2022. It initially referred to McDonald’s “1+1 = 13.9-yuan pair as you wish” $1.90 set meal, which was extremely popular among customers.\nOther Western fast food chains have subsequently jumped on the bandwagon, launching their own low-price set meals.\nOnline guides for getting weekly fast food discounts have gone viral on social media.\n“Mondays at McDonalds for free McNuggets, Tuesdays at Tastien for a ‘one-for-one’ offer, Wednesdays at Dominos for 30% off, Thursdays at KFC for the ‘crazy Thursday’ deal, Fridays at Burger King for a half-priced weekday set deal, then heading to Wallace for the weekends. Repeat next week,” according to one guide.\nNanchengxiang, a Beijing-based fast food chain, has even launched an ultra-cheap “ 3 yuan (41 cents) breakfast buffet,” setting a record low price for all you can eat meals.\nThe set, dubbed by many netizens as “a must-have for poor people working in Beijing,” has more than doubled sales during breakfast hours, according to canyin168, a data tracking and analytical website in the catering industry.\nThe “depressed” consumer sentiment is likely to stay for a while, said Yang from Counterpoint Research.\nSome Western brands “inevitably” will be forced to reconsider pricing to defend market share.\nHowever, that will be “no easy fix,” as foreign brands are at a disadvantage vis-a-vis domestic brands due to higher operating costs, he added.\nRelated article\nChina will focus on ‘high-quality, sustainable growth,’ central bank chief says\nHe doesn’t think they’re likely to pull out of the country though.\nOver the medium to long term, China is still set to drive global economic growth and contribute to the largest growing cohort of middle-class consumers.\n“With depressed economic prospects in most developed countries, and still some catching up to do for key emerging market growth markets like India, China could still offer the most lucrative market globally, even with depressed consumption levels,” he said.\nBut expectations will have to be lowered.\n“I think the fundamental mistake that many Western companies made in China was to believe in the myth of a rising middle class,” said Stevenson-Yang.\n“In reality, Chinese people had a ton of money from capital gains in real estate and the stock market; They never had big increases in income. The economy is not reverting to the poverty levels of the 1980s, but there is a lot of dialing back being done.”\n",

        "content": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex embarked on what was officially dubbed a 3-day private visit to Nigeria, yet it unfolded with all the grandeur and attention typically reserved for royal tours.\nTheir first day saw them receive a red-carpet welcome complete with cultural dancers following their arrival in the Nigerian capital of Abuja, where they kicked off a multi-day mental health summit at Lightway Academy.\nThere, they also unveiled a partnership between their Archewell Foundation and the GEANCO Foundation to provide students with school supplies and menstrual products.\nThe pair had been invited to the West African nation by the country’s highest-ranking military official, Christopher Musa. After meeting him at the Nigerian Defence Headquarters, Meghan signed a guest book thanking officials for “welcoming me home.”\nDespite the private nature of their visit, the couple’s itinerary resembled previous official tours they carried out before stepping back as senior working royals in 2020.\nThey were warmly received everywhere they went, with Nigerians showcasing their famed hospitality. The couple were showered with gifts, including a touching portrait of a young Harry with his mum.\nFor both Nigeria and the Sussexes, this visit held significant weight.\nIt was an opportunity for Nigeria to demonstrate its capability to host such high-profile guests and dispel any doubts raised by skeptics, especially considering the country’s standing in the eyes of the UK’s Foreign Office as one of the most dangerous countries to visit in the world.\nNigeria has security issues with a terrorist insurgency in the northeast and northwest. However, it is a huge country —  larger than the US state of Texas  — and the other areas visited by the royal couple over the past several days are relatively safe.\nRelated article\n‘We love you’: Harry plays volleyball with army veterans as he and Meghan get warm welcome in Nigeria\nMeanwhile, for Prince Harry and Meghan, this marked their first major trip to Africa since relinquishing their official royal duties.\nIt was a chance for them to engage in a hearts-and-minds charm offensive, which they executed with aplomb.\nMeghan, in particular, embraced exploring her Nigerian ancestry after discovering several years ago that she is 43% Nigerian through a genealogy test.\nOn Saturday, she co-hosted a women’s leadership event with Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director-General of the World Trade Organisation, for about 50 leading women from across Nigerian society and politics, business, media, and culture.\nDuring a panel discussion, moderated by Nigerian media mogul Mo Abudu, the duchess spoke passionately about uncovering her Nigerian roots and its significance to her own identity.\nShe described Nigeria as “my country,” adding that “being African American, part of it is not knowing so much about your lineage or background, where you come from specifically. And it was exciting … to discover more and understand what that really means.”\nIt was here that Meghan’s natural ability to connect really shone through. She chatted effortlessly with attendees, posed for selfies and engaged in heartfelt conversations.\nAt another event on Sunday at the prestigious Delborough Hotel in Lagos - where the great and good of Nigerian society had gathered to welcome the coupl -  she appeared visibly moved when three powerful traditional rulers honored her with royal titles.\nThe Obi of Onitsha, His Majesty Igwe Nnaemeka Alfred Ugochukwu Achebe christened Meghan “Ada Mazi,” which means “the daughter of the Igbo ancestral palace.”\nWhile, the Oluwo of Iwoland, southwest, Nigeria, Oba Abdulrasheed Adewale Akanbi christened her with the Yoruba name of “Adetokunbo” which means “royalty from across the seas.”\nTheir engagements during the three-day visit were centered around their core passions: sports rehabilitation, mental health, and women’s empowerment.\nFor Harry’s part, the duke demonstrated his compassion and connection to his late mother, Princess Diana, as he visited wounded soldiers at a military hospital in Kaduna, 150 miles from Abuja.\nHis first stop was to drop in on the governor of Kaduna state, Senator Uba Sani, where he was again welcomed by a troupe of dancers and a red carpet. Governor Sani sat opposite him and praised Harry as a “symbol of courage and “praised his service to his country.”\nHe added, “Please give our regards to the Duchess of Sussex, Princess Meghan.”\nHarry toured about six wards and met young men recuperating from their injuries. Many had been shot, ambushed by Boko Haram or lost limbs due to blasts. One moment captured by a photographer showing Harry holding a wounded soldier lying on the hospital bed during the visit resonated deeply and went viral on social media.\nCorporal Yusef, 23, who had been shot through the knee, spoke with the duke, who asked him about his rehab. “Are you going to try for the Invictus Games team? Are you preparing for that?… We will see you there,” Harry suggested.\nTheir visit also extended to cultural experiences, such as witnessing a vibrant dance performance and a polo match at the historic Lagos Polo Club.\nPolo holds special significance for Harry and the event provided a platform to showcase his longstanding commitment to the sport and its charitable endeavors.\nAmid the festivities, the couple expressed gratitude for Nigeria’s warm reception. As they bid farewell to Nigeria, Meghan declared: “I can’t wait to come back!”\n",

        "content": "From the blooming azaleas of Augusta National to the breathtaking lighthouse at Turnberry in Scotland, golf is renowned for its natural beauty. The same cannot be said, however, for the sport’s primary mode of transport.\nBut one Danish company is on a mission to put the art in golf cart.\nCopenhagen-based Garia is the self-described “world’s first and only” luxury golf and leisure car brand (that’s car, not cart), whose aims to regenerate the traditional golf buggy have led to ambitions that lie far beyond the confines of the 18-hole course.\nSuch goals seemed a long drive away in 2005 when Anders Lynge, still in design school, met Soren Bak Hansen during an internship at a car company. A short while later, having spotted a gap in the market, the duo founded Garia.\n“When it came to the golf cart 18 years ago, they all looked the same – there weren’t any serious high-end products out there,” Lynge told CNN.\n“If you lived in a high-end community – paying hundreds of thousands of dollars of membership fees, a $10 million house, whatever you had – the whole lifestyle of these people, from their cars to their clothes, watches; everything was super personalized.\n“We thought it was strange that they all had the same type of golf cart … So the idea behind Garia was basically to say, ‘How can we make a product that fulfils the lifestyle of these people, that has the same sort of quality that they’re used to from every other product they surround themselves with?’\n“That really changed our focus to say, ‘Hey, let’s do that: the ultimate golf car.’”\nAchieving that aim was easier said than done when the team was effectively tasked with reinventing the wheel and – as Lynge remarked – an unattractive one at that.\nThere are several reasons for the uniformity of the traditional golf buggy, narrow and vertical in shape, Lynge explained. The universal requirement of having to fit onto golf courses and their various cart paths – needing to perform 180-degree turns in a cul-de-sac – limits design creativity.\n“It’s like trying to do a new bicycle or a new motorcycle,” Lynge said. “You’re so heavily constrained from a technical standpoint.\n“It’s the worst kind of shape you can have – it doesn’t look very dynamic. You want something that’s sort of Lamborghini-shaped – very low and wide – but the golf cart is the exact opposite.”\nYet solutions emerged: extending the wheelbase, enlarging the cabin, unprecedented 12-inch alloy wheels without hubcaps that replaced the traditional “deep dish” look, and a double wishbone front suspension – common in sports cars – to boost handling.\nGaria’s vehicles may look bigger and more “muscular” than the average golf cart, but the proportions are the same as any other standard buggy. This is simply a visual “trick” – and far from the only one.\nA storage box tucked behind the seat serves to lift the beltline, slashing cabin space to give it more of a car feel, while accent lines and wheels pushed out to the edges help ground the vehicle.\nLynge toyed extensively with positive and negative space, taking inspiration from Porsche’s 911 to use convex and concave shapes across the car. It makes warehouse storage a “nightmare,” but the visual payoffs are worth the trouble, Lynge says.\nIn fact, it is rare that any two Garias look exactly the same.\nUsing an online configurator inspired by Nike’s shoe customizer, prospective buyers can hand-pick almost every aspect of their vehicle; from body and roof color – 44 options and rising – to wheels and interior features like refrigerators and cup holders. There are millions of possible combinations, Lynge insists.\nGerman luxury car modification firm Mansory, which works with clients including Bentley and Lamborghini, provides a range of accessories and even a full carbon-fiber car.\nRelated article\n16-year-old amateur Kris Kim wows golf world by making cut on PGA Tour debut\nOther collaborations have included German Bugatti supplier Kussmaul, which Garia paired with to build a single, special edition chrome car capable of doing 0 to 40 kilometers per hour (25 miles per hour) in less than two seconds.\nAnother involved Mercedes, whom Lynge first made contact with after winning a competition run by the car giant to design a golf cart. Lynge took the prize ceremony event as an opportunity to pitch a dream that would be realized in 2016 – a Garia golf car inspired by Mercedes-Benz Style.\nRetailing at just under €80,000 ($86,000), the fully carbon-fiber car had twice the battery life and twice the power of a typical Garia, topping out at speeds of 69 kilometers per hour (43 miles per hour).\n“Really expensive … super exclusive, but also the coolest golf car you’ll ever see,” Lynge said.\nIts scarcity means only a select few will have been seen on European roads.\nMaking street legal models was always the plan for Garia, but achieving certification is no easy feat. Extensive – and therefore expensive – safety and crash testing is required to gain road-status, and requirements differ across regions.\nWhile Europe allows for greater speeds, the US employs a strict 40 kilometers per hour (25 miles per hour) legal limit on such vehicles. But that did not discourage Lynge, who saw the prevalence of golf communities in the US as a potentially lucrative market for Garia. The company was sold by the Lars Larsen Group to American golf and utility giant Club Car in 2022.\nThe base version of Garia’s two-seater golf car – without any customization or additional features – has a manufacturer suggested retail price of €14,939 ($16,100), with the four-seater edition starting from €20,189 ($21,770). The street legal variants for both Europe and the US come in at €18,959 ($20,440) for the two-seat model and rise to €21,219 ($22,880) for four seats.\n“We very much felt that these cars are so fun to drive and they are fun to interact with,” Lynge said. “I don’t know the exact percentage, but a great part of our cars are also bought by people who don’t play golf. They are just in a holiday house.”\nAs he looks to the future, Lynges envisions Garia branching out of golf and into the leisure space, becoming “more-and-more car-like” with each passing year, making vehicles suited to urban mobility.\n“If you drive around London, how fast do you even need to go? Forty-three miles per hour is plenty of opportunity, right? There is some weird sort of space there as the market changes into full electric where everything is sort of up in the air,” he said.\n“I don’t know where we’re going to land, but I feel like we have some interesting lessons with us in this journey we’ve been on that puts us in a good position to do mobility, maybe in a wider sense, than just golf.”\n",

        "content": "A month after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the historian Yuval Noah Harari made a bold claim that seemed delusional.\nHarari made his claim in an essay on the heroism of the Ukrainian people. He praised embattled Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, who refused to flee his country when death seemed certain, telling his would-be rescuers that he needed ammunition, not a ride. He marveled at the outnumbered Ukrainian soldiers on Snake Island who told a Russian warship to “go f**k yourself,” and the civilians blocking Russian tanks with their bodies.\n“Nations are ultimately built on stories,” said Harari, author of “Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind.” “Each passing day adds more stories that Ukrainians will not only tell in the dark days ahead, but in the decades and generations to come … This is the stuff nations are built from. In the long run, these stories count for more than tanks.”\nBut there’s another type of story that’s gained traction in the US — the kind that can cause a nation to unravel. The new hit movie, “Civil War,” which has earned more than $100 million worldwide at the box office, is the latest example of a disturbing trend: We no longer seem to know how to tell well-crafted stories that counter those that depict American democracy as doomed.\nIn “Civil War,” tanks trample democracy. The film depicts a near-future America that has been torn apart by seceding regions and militia violence. It features a fascist leader in the White House, an attempted coup and Americans casually killing one another in the streets. One critic called it writer-director Alex Garland’s “very in-your-face attempt to imagine the unimaginable in America.”\nIt’s hard to imagine any other future for the United States when you consider the popularity of movies like “Civil War.” Most of the stories about the state of America that gain traction in popular culture are the ones that end in its failure. They’re the opposite of the hopeful, unifying stories any country needs to overcome tough times.\n“Civil War” is part of a growing entertainment genre that, to borrow a phrase from former President Donald Trump, could be called “American carnage.” Dystopian movies and TV shows like “The Walking Dead,” “The Purge,” “The Hunger Games,” “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “The Last of Us” all imagine a hellish future in America triggered by an environmental, political or civic collapse.\nThere’s nothing wrong with dystopian thrillers. They serve as cautionary tales and are as old as the book of Revelation. But the messages they send may be more dangerous than the violence depicted onscreen: The collapse of democracy is inevitable. Americans can never transcend their tribalism. Resistance is futile.\nThere’s something wrong when we churn out stories about superheroes in spandex banding together from different galaxies to save the universe, but we can’t tell a popular story that shows Americans coming together to save our country.\nIt didn’t used to be this way. There was another time when democracy in America was under threat, and filmmakers responded by making stirring movies aimed at lifting Americans’ spirit and equipping them for the battles ahead.\nConsider “Casablanca,” the classic 1942 film. It proves that you can tell a gripping story about patriotism without being sappy or boring. In the film, Humphrey Bogart plays Rick, the cynical owner of a Moroccan nightclub at the onset of World War II. The movie is remembered today for its classic lines (“Here’s looking at you kid”; “We’ll always have Paris”; “Round up the usual suspects”).\nYet there’s another classic line uttered by Rick — “I stick my neck out for nobody” — that hints at deeper reasons why “Casablanca” was made. The film is set before Pearl Harbor, when many Americans didn’t want to get involved in a European conflict. Adolf Hitler’s Nazi war machine seemed unstoppable. Fascism was on a global march. Democracy’s future seemed grim.\nRick responds to the impending crisis with apathy and cynicism. But when his old flame, played by actress Ingrid Bergman, walks into his club one night, she not only rekindles their romance but his idealism.\n“The movie was a patriotic rallying cry that affirmed a sense of national purpose,” wrote Cristóbal S. Berry-Cabán in an essay. “The film emphasized group effort and the value of individual sacrifices for a larger cause. It portrayed World War II as a peoples’ war, typically featuring a diverse group of people and ethnic backgrounds who are thrown together, tested, and molded into a dedicated (force) fighting fascism.”\nOther films of that era made similar storytelling choices. Legendary Hollywood director Frank Capra made a series of seven patriotic films during World War II called “Why We Fight” that rallied Americans in the fight against fascism.\nThe entertainer Frank Sinatra, a paragon of mid-20th century American masculinity, starred in a short film called “The House We Live In.” It would be labeled “woke” today. In the film, Sinatra intervenes when he sees a group of youths chasing a Jewish boy. He tells them that “religion makes no difference, except to a Nazi or someone who’s stupid.” The film was eventually selected by the Library of Congress as being “culturally and historically” significant.\nSinatra would later record a song with the same title as the film, which he would perform throughout his career. It included lines like, “The faces that I see. All races and religions. That’s America to me.”\nOther World War II-era films like “Don’t be a Sucker,” which emphasized racial and religious tolerance in America, emphasized the same message. It went viral after the 2017 neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\nThose black-and-white films may seem dated and idealistic in an America that has been through the Vietnam War, Watergate, 9/11 and January 6. But a country needs a unifying story like a human being needs oxygen.\n“Stories are essential to holding a nation together,” says Kermit Roosevelt III, a historian and author of “The Nation That Never Was: Reconstructing America’s Story.” “You have to have something that motivates people to make sacrifices for the nation. If you’re going to fight a war, you have to have people who are willing to lay down their lives. But we more often call on people to make sacrifices for others, to bear burdens, promote justice and help out the less fortunate.”\nThat doesn’t mean we return to the days of making clumsy propaganda films. But Roosevelt says we should keep in mind that most stories contain some elements of propaganda.\n“We have this idea that propaganda is bad or ideology is bad,” Roosevelt says. “But I think that history and education are inherently ideological, and there’s a perspective there and you’re trying to impart lessons.”\nSome of America’s most gifted political leaders knew that lesson well. Two of the most consequential presidents in recent memory — Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama — were master storytellers. They told stories that made Americans believe in democracy, in one another and in their country’s future.\nReagan’s skills were on display when he told a story about American vitality in his farewell speech that echoed Sinatra’s “The House We Live In.” He said the source of America’s greatness was immigrants.\n“While other countries cling to the stale past, here in America we breathe life into dreams,” Reagan said. “Thanks to each wave of new arrivals to this land of opportunity, we’re a nation forever young, forever bursting with energy and new ideas, and always on the cutting edge, always leading the world to the world to the next frontier. This quality is vital to our future as a nation.”\nFormer President Obama cited his personal story as a reason to believe in America, despite the country’s history of not living up to its ideals. The son of a White mother from Kansas and a Black father from Kenya, Obama said his journey to national prominence was proof that the American dream was possible.\n“I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on Earth is my story even possible,” he during his speech at the  2004 Democratic National Convention, which would eventually catapult him to the White House.\nIt’s easy to dismiss Reagan’s and Obama’s storytelling as the product of clever speechwriters. What candidate doesn’t call America great, or vow that anything is possible in the land of the free and home of the brave?\nBut the dominant American political figure of recent years does not typically tell such unifying stories about his country. Former President Trump coined the term “American carnage” during his 2017 inaugural address. He routinely describes an America that more resembles the failed state depicted in the “Civil War” movie, with his declaration in January that “We are a nation in decline, we are a failing nation.”\nTelling that kind of story hasn’t appeared to hurt Trump any more than it hurt the makers of “Civil War.” And, truth be told, stories of American greatness can ring hollow to the descendants of enslaved Americans, the Japanese Americans interned during World War II and those dismayed today by politicians and judges who disregard democratic norms.\nHow can we tell a story today that doesn’t ignore the brutality of American history but still inspires hope for the future?\nThere’s another figure from the past who may help us.\nWalt Whitman, the 19th century writer dubbed “the poet of democracy,” said that America was his greatest poem. Through poetry, Whitman did what so many seem incapable of today — he made a multiracial, multireligious democracy in America visceral and exciting, not a civics lesson.\nIn “Songs of Myself,” Whitman vividly described America as “the Nation of many nations,” and said of himself and his country,” “Of every hue and caste am I, of every rank and religion.”\nRead Whitman today and one is struck by his expansive definition of what it means to be an American. No one is excluded — he treats the “boatman and clam-diggers, the farmer, the deacon, the runaway slave, the prostitute and the president with equal reverence, “For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.”\nThe historian Ian Beacock said Whitman offers an answer for those who wonder how they can defend democracy against stories that predict its demise. He suggests they take Whitman’s approach: “State an emotional case for democracy that appeals as much to those who already possess power as to those yet without it.”\nIt starts with being honest about the appeal of other modes of government, like fascism, he says.\n“It’s obvious that being free and equal is better than being dominated,” Beacock wrote.” But is it better than dominating? Exerting power over others is a seductive feeling, too, if a dark and dangerous one.”\nMany democracies simply “unravel” because their citizens get complacent, Beacock says. Democracy is hard to sustain because of its constant demands for compromise. People often go shopping for alternatives that seem like less work, he says.\nWhitman told stories about democracy that engaged people’s feelings, not just their intellect, Beacock says.\n“This is perhaps Whitman’s core contribution to democratic thought and practice: the reminder that democracy’s defenders mustn’t neglect political feelings (“Logic and sermons never convince”) and that self-government must appeal to the human heart if it is to last long. “\nThe Austrian philosopher Ivan Illich was once asked about the most revolutionary way to change a society. He said:\n“Neither revolution nor reformation can ultimately change a society, rather you must tell a new powerful tale, one so persuasive that it sweeps away the old myths and becomes the preferred story, one so inclusive that it gathers all the bits of our past and our present into a coherent whole, one that even shines some light into our future so that we can take the next step…”\nHow Americans in 2024 decide to tell their national story is up for debate. What shouldn’t be up for discussion, though, is the need for such stories. Isn’t it time we tell a new story of a future America where the White House isn’t going up in flames and citizens aren’t murdering one another?\nThe box office success of “Civil War” ensures, though, that more “American carnage” stories are likely headed our way. Though the film doesn’t take any political sides, it amplifies the same message that autocrats in Russia and China are making through their propaganda: America is hopelessly divided and degenerate, and democracy is doomed.\nMaybe it’s time to rediscover what Americans of another era knew. Those old black-and-white films about what makes America special may seem corny now. But they understood that you must defend democracy not only with tanks, but with stirring tales that reverberate for generations to come.\nIf you believe democracy is under threat in America, find a “new powerful tale” that inspires us to believe it has a future.\nBut don’t dispense platitudes or give us a civics lesson.\nTell us a story.\nJohn Blake is a Senior Writer at CNN and the author of “More Than I Imagined: What a Black Man Discovered About the White Mother He Never Knew.”\n",

        "content": "Vladimir Putin, Muammar Gaddafi, Mark Zuckerberg. Presidents and Hollywood stars; political dissidents, abuse survivors and immigrants. One thing unites them all: a slightly scuffed, white wooden box.\n“More world leaders have sat on that box than any chair in history,” the photographer Platon, owner of that very box, told CNN in an interview conducted over Zoom. For some world leaders, the scarcity of his set — sitting on the box in front of a plain black or white sheet of paper — can be intimidating, stripping them of their usual grandeur. For others it’s liberating, allowing the human to shine through the professional storyteller. For the subjects of Platon’s new book “The Defenders,” the box became an opportunity.\n“There’s a statement that’s quite common in the human rights community,” Platon said. “‘Giving a voice to the voiceless’. I have learned through my experiences that it’s not right to say that. They have beautiful, powerful, strong voices; the issue is that those voices have been ignored.” Through his work, he explained his mission is to help amplify people’s stories, tuning into their humanity as though they were “an old-fashioned radio”.\nBorn in Greece in 1968, Platon Antoniou moved to the UK aged eight and completed his studies in photography at the Royal College of Art, before leaving London for a career in New York. There, he worked on George magazine with John Kennedy Jr. and as a staff photographer at the New Yorker magazine.\n“The Defenders” takes a different tack to Platon’s earlier work. As a young photographer, he confessed he was dazzled by the world of politicians and celebrities he was working with, walking the corridors of the Kremlin and Downing Street and “having a chat about life” in George Clooney’s garden. Turning his lens to the powerless, by contrast, has upturned his ideas of power altogether.\nRelated article\nThe photographer who changed the way the world saw New York\n“Having photographed all these world leaders, often the people I meet in the trenches of the human rights movement are proper leaders,” he said. “They transform their adversity into compassion for others. And that’s something I very rarely see on that level in the political sphere. So I called them — I call the book — “The Defenders,” because it’s a superhero title. These are ordinary people who do extraordinary things, and I do think of them as superheroes. Changing the narrative is very important for me.”\nAmong “The Defenders” are Burmese and Egyptian dissidents, the imprisoned Russian punk band Pussy Riot, and survivors of sexual violence at Dr. Denis Mukwege’s Panzi Hospital in Congo. One of the girls that Platon photographed there was Esther Faraja. She appeared in an episode of Netflix’s “Abstract: The Art of Design,” profiling Platon, although he said the details of the trauma she suffered were “too harsh to put in the film.”\n“As I was taking the picture, she wasn’t crying,” he recalled. “I’m a privileged, middle-aged white man, and I’m a mess. I said to her, ‘how is it that I’m crying, and you’re not crying? And yet, you’re the one that has suffered?’ And she said: ‘the reason I don’t cry in your picture is because I don’t want to make you feel sad. I don’t want anyone to feel sad when they look at a picture of me. My mommy and daddy brought me into this world to bring joy to the world. And I will keep my promise’.” Platon is as awestruck now as he was standing in front of her. “Now that is a leader,” he said. “I made a promise to her that I will deliver her message of compassion and strength, combined, to as many people as I can.”\n“The Defenders” is an attempt to tell dozens of stories like hers, each captured in one 500th of a second. “Time is a very interesting concept; it doesn’t really ever exist,” Platon mused. “You try to freeze a moment that helps us understand the past and will still be relevant in the future. And yet, it was a moment in the present. And it was such a tiny fragment of a moment that if you blinked, you wouldn’t even have seen it.”\nTwo political giants offer obvious examples of time’s bizarre effect. Vladimir Putin, photographed by Platon for Time’s Person of the Year in 2007, initially liked the image that Platon produced. He appears powerful. In the time since its publication, however, the same image has been taken, edited, and circulated by political dissidents to mock Putin and belittle his power.\nRelated article\nWhy this morning-after portrait of Faye Dunaway became an iconic Hollywood moment\n“I heard in the last two years that anyone who’s caught circulating my picture in connection with human rights issues will go to jail,” Platon said. “Now, it’s the same picture. And Putin likes it.”\nBill Clinton, on a December 2000 cover of Esquire courtesy of Platon, has also been changed with age. “At the time, that picture represented insane levels of charisma,” Platon recalled. “He was great with people — everyone says there’s no one more charismatic than Bill Clinton. We look at it through a different lens now, but it’s the same picture. When I get it right, that same picture works for everybody.”\nIt doesn’t work for Hillary Clinton, though. “Hillary refuses to sit for me,” Platon noted. “She’s one of the only politicians who’s ever said no. And that’s interesting. The ‘no’ now is actually as interesting as the ‘yes’.”\nDistilling broad, complicated, emotional human stories into one fleeting moment is a tribulation of all photography, including that of world leaders, but it was particularly difficult when it came to the sensitive topics broached in “The Defenders”. “Many of (the people photographed) risk their lives and their security telling me these stories,” Platon said. “I cannot be reckless. I cannot be — I must not be — a thrill-seeker.”\nExerting due diligence and handling sensitive subjects thoughtfully is something that Platon admits is a luxury of time; he is able to spend months on a project, producing the most considered and provoking images he can. Increasingly, however, a lot of the photography flooding social media is taken hastily, captured on phones and shared without so much as a pause for breath. In “The Defenders,” Platon remembers the Burmese politician Aung San Suu Kyi coming out of house arrest and being bewildered by the sea of smartphones pointed at her.\n“Now everyone’s a photographer, and everyone’s a filmmaker,” Platon observed. “In many ways, that’s fantastic. People are holding the powers that be accountable in a new way. The danger is that there’s so much information that we’re constantly distracted. It’s very difficult to get that moment of reflection and pause, and to stand back and think for yourself. As you’re even doing that, your phone is dinging and clicking and beeping — it’s constant noise.”\nIn standing back, Platon was able to join the dots between the movements he was documenting; they weren’t isolated struggles, he realized, but connected ones. “Obviously each geopolitical situation is inherently different, but they are all fighting for very basic human principles,” he said. “I photographed LGBTQ+ defenders in Burma and in Russia. That’s two very, very different countries, with the same cause.”\nIn capturing and amplifying the stories of “The Defenders,” Platon hopes to inspire and instruct other people, just as he was inspired and instructed.\n“It’s really a handbook to the new generation to say: roll up your sleeves, get involved. Society needs a new generation of activists who will think differently. They will have a different path to navigate, but the principles remain timeless and the same. It’s the principles that unite us all. The way we fight, the tools we fight with, the strategies — we have to change those, because times change. But the principles stay the same.”\n“The Defenders”, published by MW Editions, is available now.\n",

        "content": "It is one of the world’s oldest running annual sporting fixtures which, over the years, has featured a British Prime Minister, international cricketers and the Romantic poet Lord Byron.\nFor more than 200 years, Eton and Harrow – two of England’s most expensive private schools – have faced off against each other at Lord’s, the cricket ground in North London steeped in history and referred to as the “home of cricket.”\nBut the fixture has become increasingly controversial and indicative of many British institutions’ attempts to reconcile their traditions with becoming more inclusive. The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which owns Lord’s, sought to axe the match from the ground’s schedule before granting it a reprieve after some of its members protested.\nThose arguing for its removal expressed “an appetite to promote cricket as a game for all and as a place where all feel welcome” while those against it stressed the need to maintain “the Club’s history and traditions,” as an MCC statement put it.\nAs a compromise, the MCC announced in March that it would host both the Eton vs. Harrow and Oxford vs. Cambridge fixtures for another five years, before another consultation with members.\nThe club will also host the finals of the UK’s school and university cricket competitions, rather than only the historic fixtures.\nActor, presenter and writer Stephen Fry, the current president of the MCC, called on members last year, in an interview with British newspaper The Times, to support stopping the match at Lord’s to help cricket “lose that image it sometimes still has – a turgid image of snobbery and elitism.”\n“That’s not what cricket is about,” he added. “It’s the second most popular sport in the world and it needs people to understand what a wonderful game it is, and how it’s available for everybody.”\n“No-one could have foreseen quite how divided the Club became on this issue,” MCC chair Bruce Carnegie-Brown said in a statement in March, “and the Committee deserves credit for implementing a pragmatic solution that gives those divisions the opportunity to heal, yet also leaves a sensible review mechanism in place.”\nFor the moment, the schoolboys of Eton and Harrow continue to play each other every year on the hallowed, carefully maintained grass at Lord’s. They took to the field on Friday and Harrow emerged victorious by just four runs.\n",

        "content": "Summer is almost here, and you’re looking forward to that long-awaited vacation. You can even picture it: ﻿The sun is shining, the waves are rolling gently and you’re curling up with a book.\nPerhaps you’re diving into a steamy romance novel or losing yourself in a page-turning thriller. Maybe a work of romantasy is captivating you instead. Whatever your flavor of escapism, it’s likely that it could be classified as a “beach read” — that oft-dismissed, unofficial category of books that readers gravitate toward in the warmer months.\nBut what exactly constitutes a beach read? And where did that idea come from? Here’s what to know about the popular term.\nA beach read is, naturally, the sort of book one might read at the beach — or at a lake, a resort or another typical summer destination.\nThe books populating “beach read” round-ups from booksellers, publishers and periodicals generally fall into the category of commercial fiction, designed to lure in readers with their saturated covers and playful illustrations. They’re also almost always marketed to women.\nAmanda Bergeron, who acquires contemporary and historical book club fiction for Penguin Random House’s imprint Berkley, has published several authors whose books frequently appear on “beach read” lists: Carley Fortune, Jasmine Guillory and Emily Henry, to name a few. When looking for the next big summer read, Bergeron says she’s drawn to fast-paced stories with compelling characters. If it transports the reader to another location, all the better.\n“It’s something that you’re excited to spend time with and you can’t put down — something that you’re just so eager to get back to that it will go with you wherever you go, whether that’s the park, the pool, the couch, your yard or even the beach,” she says.\nSome books just scream summer, presenting an obvious opportunity to be marketed as a beach read, according to Bergeron. If it takes place in the summer, perhaps on an island or another breezy locale, there’s a good chance it could be a beach read. Sometimes, the “beach read” designation is so fitting that it announces itself in the title, like Fortune’s 2022 romance novel “Every Summer After,” Jenn McKinlay’s 2023 rom-com “Summer Reading” or Henry’s aptly named 2020 “Beach Read.”\nWhile the romance genre tends to dominate the “beach read” landscape, the label isn’t limited to romance, says Bergeron. A beach read can just as easily be a suspenseful thriller or a puzzle-box mystery novel — at least for Bergeron, it’s a book that readers will want to discuss with others and bring along with them on vacation.\nIn other words, a beach read doesn’t ask the reader to ponder the grim realities of the modern world or plunge into the depths of the human experience. Rather, it offers a break from the slog of daily life and the constant drumbeat of depressing news stories.\n“For God’s sake, I do not want to be challenged,” Celeste Ballard declared in a 2014 humor column for The New Yorker about how to pick a summer read. “No ‘hard’ literature that I have to slog through to discover a deep and twisted meaning.”\nEven though the “beach read” designation can go hand in hand with commercial success (books labeled as such frequently make bestseller lists), it’s also a loaded term.\nAuthor Jennifer Weiner, whose books are often categorized as beach reads, rejected the label for years before eventually embracing it — an internal conflict she examined in a 2020 essay for Goodreads.\n“It’s not hard to discern a whiff of Coppertone-scented sexism in the label,” she wrote. “Fast-paced, diverting books that are by or for men are called thrillers or mysteries or sometimes just plain old books, while the ladies get every kind of label, from chick lit to women’s fiction to upmarket women’s fiction to domestic fiction to, well, beach books.”\nBooks labeled as beach reads tend to emphasize plot and characters over elegant prose and heavier themes. To some, the implication is that the book is less serious or less worthy of one’s time.\nDakota Johnson, who launched a book club earlier this year, seemed to echo that assumption in an interview with Bustle: “Our book club is literary fiction. It’s not beach reads. It’s not silly,” she said.\nThough the term “beach read” is commonly associated with frothy romance novels, Bergeron says that notion can be reductive. Beach reads can absolutely be frivolous — sometimes, that’s exactly what you need — but some of the most celebrated beach reads of the past few years explore weightier topics all while delivering on the promise of fun.\nFor instance, Fortune’s 2023 bestseller “Meet Me at the Lake” depicted postpartum anxiety and the loss of a family member, while Kiley Reid’s buzzy 2019 debut “Such A Fun Age” dealt with race and privilege. “A Love Like the Sun,” a forthcoming novel from Riss M. Neilson, includes representation of chronic illness.\n“The fact that writers are able to do all that and offer readers an escape or a big heart hug is just really exciting,” Bergeron says.\nThe term “beach read” first appeared in literary periodicals around 1990, according to an article by the Los Angeles Public Library — though it’s unclear who coined it.\nThe concept of the summer read goes back much further, says Donna Harrington-Lueker, a professor of English and communications at Salve Regina University and author of Books for Idle Hours: Nineteenth-Century Publishing and the Rise of Summer Reading. Though now ingrained in our culture, the notion of summer reading was actually a 19th century invention of the publishing industry that sprung up in response to the creation of the summer vacation.\nSummer reading was initially a ritual enjoyed by rich men, who could afford to engage in leisure travel and unwind with poetry and literature, according to Harrington-Lueker. That changed in the mid-to-late 19th century as the US rapidly industrialized after the Civil War. The construction of railroads and grand hotels made summer vacations more accessible for the middle classes, giving rise to what Harrington-Lueker calls the “summer novel.”\nThe summer novel was specifically geared toward women, Harrington-Lueker explains. The books generally took place over the summer at a resort and tended to follow the rhythms of the season: There might be scenes anchored around a picnic or a fireworks display, with detailed descriptions of what the female characters were wearing. Typically, the books ended with the heroine getting engaged.\n“These become lessons in how you practice summer leisure, and they become very popular,” Harrington-Lueker says.\nThe proliferation of the summer novel also generated backlash from some religious leaders who considered them a temptation and devoid of morality. The Reverend T. De Witt Talmage notably declared in an 1876 sermon that “there is more pestiferous trash read among the intelligent classes in July and August than in all the other ten months of the year.”\n“Would it not be an awful thing for you to be struck with lightning some day when you had in your hand one of these paper-covered romances—the hero a Parisian roué, the heroine an unprincipled flirt … ?” he chided at the time.\nBut throughout the late 1800s, the publishing industry worked to counter such notions and present summer reading as something desirable, Harrington-Lueker says. Magazines such as The Atlantic Monthly or Harper’s ran advertisements with women clad in muslin dresses, novel in hand, while literary critics extolled the benefits of lighter reading.\n“The cakes and ale of literature have their legitimate time and place after the more solid intellectual dishes of the past season have been digested,” an 1887 editorial in the literary review Book Buyer reads.\nMuch like today, summer reads at the time were seen as an escape from the turmoil of the real world. One 1885 magazine column Harrington-Lueker encountered in her research called that summer’s novels “peculiarly trivial” and hypothesized that publishers were responding to the cholera epidemic, believing “that the general mind will be so far distraught by anxiety as to have no attention to spare for being critical.”\nAs publishers solidified the association between summer and light reading, some institutions promoted more serious reading during the season, Harrington-Lueker said.\nOne notable example is the Chautauqua movement, a late 19th and early 20th century educational program that sought to help Americans improve themselves through reading. From schools requiring students to read so-called classics in the summer to the anti-racist reading lists that were ubiquitous in 2020, the idea of summer as a time for personal enrichment persists today. Indeed, some people reach for heftier titles during vacation precisely because they finally have the time to dig into them.\n“Summer reading becomes a point where people automatically begin to think, ‘How should we be spending our summer? Should we be spending it with escapist fiction that’s going to renew us, that’s going to give us this time apart from a more difficult world? Or should we be using it to engage with topics of more consequence?’” Harrington-Lueker says.\nThat push and pull between reading as escapism and reading as enrichment has long been a part of American culture, Harrington-Lueker adds. In recent years, she says she’s observed that the titles appearing on summer reading lists from The New York Times, Oprah’s Book Club and other cultural tastemakers seem less escapist than they were in previous years.\nBut from Bergeron’s perspective, plenty of readers are still looking for a respite — and this year’s offerings (she name-checked Ashley Poston’s “A Novel Love Story,” Kirsty Greenwood’s “The Love of My Afterlife” and Tia Williams’ “A Love Song for Ricki Wilde”) give them plenty of opportunities to do so.\n“Readers want to be transported,” she says. “(When you think of an) escape often you think light, but I think it’s the ability to inhabit another world or another set of shoes and just spend time in those pages.”\nAt a time when the world feels uncertain and overwhelming, Bergeron says, the beach read beckons.\n",

        "content": "Editor’s Note: This article was originally published by The Business of Fashion, an editorial partner of CNN Style.\n(CNN) — A little over a year ago, NFL player Travis Kelce stepped out in a flamboyant silk shirt emblazoned with two barrel-chest-sized pink flamingos and trimmed across the bottom with a giant Chanel logo.\nThe design was upcycled from vintage Chanel scarves by stylist Logan Horne, whose brand, J. Logan Home, specializes in refashioning heritage luxury accessories. His pieces, which retail at close to $3,000 each, have also been worn by the musicians Dua Lipa and 2 Chainz and are sold at stores including Farfetch, Kith and The Webster. They’ve also caught the attention of the French luxury giant’s legal department.\nIn February, lawyers acting for Chanel sent Horne a cease and desist letter, demanding his label stop selling products bearing its logo and other brand signifiers.\nRelated article\nCapturing the ambitious beauty of Karl Lagerfeld’s Chanel shows\nIt’s the latest in a flurry of cases that have turned upcycling into an emerging legal battle ground, pitting a practice that’s been pitched as key to improving the industry’s sustainability credentials against the established bounds of trademark protection.\n“We really have these two values that point in different directions,” said Fashion Law Institute founder Susan Scafidi. “(Upcycling) is absolutely risky, despite the fact that it is trending and ethical.”\nChanel’s objection to J. Logan Home’s designs isn’t exactly a bolt from the blue.\nMajor luxury players have historically been wary of the secondary market, concerned it could damage their carefully controlled hold on brand distribution and image, cannibalize sales and encourage counterfeiting.\nIt’s a tension that has played out prominently over the last decade thanks to the rapid rise of online resale platforms. Though some brands have begun to tentatively embrace the space, others have remained cautious. Chanel, in particular, has pursued high-profile cases against re-commerce players it argues are using its brand without permission and selling fakes.\n(The brand scored a major win earlier this year, when a New York court awarded it $4 million in damages in its suit against the resale business What Goes Around Comes Around. A separate legal dispute with The RealReal is ongoing.)\nSmaller-scale upcycling has attracted less attention so far. But the practice has become more widespread, driven in part by demand for logo-heavy streetwear, greater access to vintage products and deadstock fabrics and a growing desire among young designers to operate sustainably.\nThat’s given rise to an increasing number of trademark and copyright infringement complaints targeting upcyclers from brands including Louis Vuitton and Levi’s, as well as Chanel.\nIn 2022, Louis Vuitton secured a $603,000 pay out and permanent injunction in a Texas case against a business selling refashioned Vuitton products. Last year, Levi’s brought a complaint against French label Coperni, alleging it was using pocket stitching and fabric tabs confusingly similar to the famed denim label. The sale of such products, alongside items that had actually been upcycled from Levi’s jeans without authorization, created additional risk of consumer confusion, the company argued.\nBoth brands declined to comment when reached by Business of Fashion.\nThe disputes reflect legitimate trademark and copyright concerns, but they also raise questions over how far these protections should stretch when they conflict with broader sustainability goals, according to legal experts.\n“It is a grey area within the law,” said Scafidi. “Brands absolutely have a legal leg to stand on. The question is how well-clad it is.”\nIn general terms, once a brand has sold an item, it becomes fair game to be resold or redistributed by third parties. But this principle, known as the first-sale doctrine or trademark exhaustion, may not apply if an item has been reworked or embellished, lawyers said.\nUpcyclers can take precautions, like avoiding the prominent use of logos, or providing consumers with clear disclosures that reworked products are not authorized or affiliated with the brands they reference (an approach J. Logan Home adopted). But these steps still may not be sufficient to counter arguments of copyright or trademark infringement, according to lawyers.\nAnd while the legal frameworks protecting companies’ intellectual property are well established, whether the sustainability benefits of upcycling should be weighed against these hasn’t really been tested.\nRelated article\nSpot the ‘superfake’: Fashion brands want you to be able to identify counterfeits\n“If we want to move from a linear to a circular economy, we need to upcycle,” said Irene Calboli, a professor of law at Texas A&M University. “The fact that intellectual property law gets in the way of those who want to upcycle or recycle is just wrong.”\nChanel said it is paying close attention to sustainability matters, pointing to its work with L’Atelier des Matières, which recycles unsold items and deadstock from luxury and premium brands.\n“(Upcycling is) a positive trend that we continue to explore, and we have always been conscious of the need to strike a balance between protecting the rights of our brand and the rights of others to create and trade freely,” the company said in a statement. “However, the use of elements stamped with the Chanel logo is sometimes simply an unauthorized misappropriation of our trademarks… in such cases, we take the action we deem appropriate to protect our rights.”\nThe wider legal crackdown hasn’t only targeted brands making prominent use of logos either.\nBefore she became a celebrated New York designer, Batsheva Hay worked as a copyright lawyer. So it was a shock when she found herself on the receiving end of a cease and desist letter from a large commercial brand over a short run of dresses made from deadstock fabric sourced from India. Though it bore no obvious logo, as it turned out, the print she used had been made for a bigger player who didn’t want to see it reproduced elsewhere.\n“I was really humiliated and horrified because I thought it was some cool vintage fruit print and it turned out to be some kind of junky commercial print,” said Hay. Rather than take on the time and expense of fighting the case, she just took the remaining three dresses she hadn’t yet sold off her site.\nHorne says he can’t afford to fight Chanel, which has threatened to seek statutory damages of $2 million per mark, disgorgement of all profits and payment of its attorney’s fees if he doesn’t stop selling products carrying the company’s branding, according to a copy of the letter reviewed by Business of Fashion.\nInstead, he said he’s looking at to pivot his brand while continuing to find creative ways to address the industry’s issues with waste and over-production. The dream would be an opportunity to officially collaborate with an established label on an upcycled collection.\n“As much as I believe in my mission… I’m not trying to go bankrupt going to battle with Chanel,” he said.\nIndustry watchers say the current flurry of cases reflect a broader adjustment to emerging new models. Some big brands, like Prada, Gucci and indeed Levi’s, have already dabbled with upcycling collections and programs of their own. Anna Foster, who runs the refashioned brand E.L.V. Denim, has partnered with companies including Gabriela Hearst and The Outnet to help upcycle excess inventory. These days, she says she’s having about a conversation a week with brands interested in exploring collaboration, but the industry moves slowly.\nRelated article\nAsian rivers are turning black. And our colorful closets are to blame\nMeanwhile, politics may be moving at a faster speed, creating different challenges for brands. Both consumers and policy makers are increasingly aware of the huge levels of waste generated by the fashion industry, with new regulations that would make brands more responsible for dealing with old clothes and excess inventory in the pipeline in both Europe and the US.\n“We really are at an inflection point where we might have a result in court that is different from the result in the court of social media,” said Scafidi. “It’s that tension that really needs to be resolved.”\nThis article was originally published by The Business of Fashion, an editorial partner of CNN Style.

        "content": "Former reality star Kate Gosselin shared a rare photo of some of her children on Mother’s Day.\nIn her first Instagram post this year, the mother of twins and sextuplets posted a photo Sunday of four of her sextuplets with a chocolate-frosted birthday cake that had candles in the shape of the number 20.\n“No more teenagers in this house! Happy 20th birthday, my forever babies! I love you! Who feels old? I know I do! #20yearsold #ItsaPICKLE,” she wrote in the caption. The sextuplets were born on May 10, 2004.\nWhile Alexis, Aaden, Leah and Joel feature in the celebratory picture, two of the six, Collin and Hannah, are missing.\nCollin, who lives with Hannah at their father’s house, said in an interview with Entertainment Tonight in 2022 that he “didn’t have a relationship” with his mother, and that he had not spoken to Alexis, Aaden, Joel and Leah, or older twin siblings Cara and Mady, in five or six years.\nRelated article\nCollin Gosselin says ‘Jon & Kate Plus 8’ tore his family apart\nAfter Gosselin divorced her ex-husband Jon in a high-profile split in 2009, she received primary custody of their eight children. However, a custody battle between the pair lasted for a decade, with Jon eventually being granted custody of Collin.\nCollin said during the interview that he thought what “tore us apart” was “TV and what being in the public eye does to a family.”\nThe Gosselins rose to fame in the late 2000s with the hit TLC documentary-style reality TV series “Jon & Kate Plus 8,” which ran from 2007 to 2009.\nIn 2010, after the couple’s divorce, the series turned into “Kate Plus 8,” focusing on Kate Gosselin and her children. That ended in 2017.\nTwo years later, Gosselin featured in TLC show “Kate Plus Date,” which documented her quest for her perfect match after being single for a decade.\nIn a TikTok video last year, one of her twins, Mady, said she was tired of the public feeling like they are owed access to her family because they were once reality stars, stating that “it’s not anyone else’s business” what is happening behind closed doors.\n“Regardless of whatever narrative you have created in your head from what you’ve seen, my siblings are doing so well. They are all amazing people. They are all smart, they are all kind, they’re driven students, they’re working hard, they’re funny, they’re stylish,” she added.\nCNN’s Lisa Respers France contributed reporting.\n",

        "content": "If you took an American Airlines flight in the 1960s, you’d be wined and dined from the Coach-class  “Royal Coachman” menu. Your meal began with the beef consommé and proceeded to sautéed breast of chicken in wine. Care for a fruit tartlet for dessert?\nToday, if you’re flying coach, you’ll need to book a long-distance international flight or – maybe if you’re lucky – a coast-to-coast domestic one to receive a free meal. On shorter flights, you might get a choice of complementary Biscoff cookies or pretzels.\nAirplane food has fallen a long way from the glory days of in-flight dining when meals were served on white tablecloths and stewardesses scrambled eggs in the air. Disappearing meals have joined a long list of pain points, inconveniences and cutbacks that fliers endure today. But industry cost-cutting isn’t the only reason your tartlet is gone. The end of in-flight dining for many passengers surprisingly rose out of big changes in government regulation, airplane design, in-flight movies, industry tax breaks, plus heightened health and safety concerns.\nAirline safety protocols and regulations since September 11 have changed what types of cooking knives crews can work with in the air. Airplane galleys are smaller to allow for more passenger seats on a plane. And airlines don’t serve some foods, like peanuts, to protect people with allergies. Meals are often smaller, blander or non-existent.\n“Meal service was once a point of pride,” said Henry Harteveldt, who covers the travel industry for Atmosphere Research Group. Now, “the quality is so poor you have to wonder: Do airline executives actually have taste buds?”\nAirlines have long looked for ways to cut food production costs and reduce meal preparation times for flight attendants on board. In one famous example during the 1980s, Robert Crandall, then the head of American Airlines, bragged about how removing just one olive from every salad saved the airline $40,000 a year.\nCost and speed became more important to airlines than how the food tastes ever since. Carriers like Singapore Airlines or Delta may have partnerships with Michelin-starred celebrity chefs, but most companies farm out their food to catering services who may prepare it hours ahead.\n“People are willing to trade food for low fares,” said Blaise Waguespack, a professor of airline marketing at Embry‑Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida. “Your ticket gets you the seat. And anything beyond the seat you pay for.”\nCharging passengers for food on board – even just a few dollars for a sandwich, snack box or cheese plate - is also a way for airlines to save on taxes. Domestic airfares are subject to a 7.5% federal excise tax, but that tax doesn’t apply to baggage fees and on-board food, both of which are getting more expensive.\nFood on planes has been around almost a century, ever since 1920s flight attendants handed out chewing gum to passengers to relieve pressure in their ears. Early airplanes bounced so much in flight that meals were served on paper plates, according to the Smithsonian.\nFor decades, the federal government regulated airfare and routes, so airlines tried to set themselves apart with service, food and the kind of luxury usually afforded cruise passengers – or a Bond villain.\nUntil 1978, when the airline industry was deregulated, the law required that every passenger got an entrée, two vegetables, a salad, dessert and a drink as part of their ticket price, according to the Smithsonian.\n“Delicious food adds to the enjoyment. It’s prepared in four simultaneously operating galleys, where dishes can be cooked in five-minute ovens,” Pan Am advertised in a 1958 commercial.\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, airlines routinely installed sky-high kitchens on board and advertised their menus to draw customers. Beef was a business strategy.\n”Airlines competed on service and amenities. Meal service was a big focus of [competition] because entertainment options were more limited,” Harteveldt said. “Airlines would have teams of chefs, their own catering kitchens [and] advertising around food.”\nAs deregulation took hold, airlines cut ticket prices. But to make up for lost revenue, they cut back on food choices and other services as well.\nThe September 11 attacks accelerated the decline of free airline meals. Airlines faced a deep reduction in demand and slashed in-flight meal service in response. United, American Airlines, Delta and others announced sharp reductions in-flight meal service shortly after the attacks.\nThe last holdout, Continental Airlines, became the final major airline to end free domestic meals in economy class in 2010.\nAirline meals had been the brunt of jokes and criticism for decades, but now people miss them. Few airline-industry experts see them coming back anytime soon in coach.\nThe reality is very different for business and first-class passengers.\nMolly Brandt, the executive chef of culinary innovation for North America at in-flight catering company Gategroup, said that the “golden age for airline food is here.” It just depends on which airline you’re flying and category you’re in. “It’s broken down by cabin class,” she explained.\nIf you’re in first class on an American flight, for example, you may have a lunch choice of a Mediterranean bowl, chicken breast with mojo sauce, Poblano black bean rice and plantains or penne pasta with plant-based ragu and ricotta. For Delta, pick between the cheeseburger, the spinach and cheese agnolotti, or a Hempler’s smoked peppered chicken breast salad.\nA handful of airlines even offer caviar to first class passengers. But most fliers these days don’t even get the free chewing gum.\n",

        "content": "McDonald’s and other fast food chains are charging more. So much so that you may want to consider going for a slightly slower burger. Or at least, that’s what Applebee’s wants you to think about.\n“You can get our burger for $9.99,” John Peyton, CEO of Applebee’s parent company Dine Brands, told CNN in an interview. With that in mind, “why would you take a $10 burger … that you can eat in a bag out of your car?”\nIf Peyton’s sales pitch resonates with customers, it could help convince diners to eat at sit-down restaurants, something they might otherwise see as an indulgence.\nFor a while, restaurant customers were trading down — swapping out expensive meals for cheaper ones, but still dining out. Now, some are responding to higher menu prices by trading out entirely: Instead of opting for cheaper restaurants or meals, they’re eating more at home and spending less when they do go out.\nThat means that restaurants have to battle it out for these cost-conscious consumers. And now, it’s not just burger chain against burger chain.\nRelated article\nRestaurants are competing for frugal diners’ dollars\nBecause fast food joints have been hiking up prices in recent years, dine-in spots like Applebee’s can run promotions that end up costing about the same as a fast food lunch — giving them a chance to try to steal those customers away.\nThe overlap offers “a new opportunity,” according to Peyton. Lunch at McDonald’s now costs about the same as lunch at Applebee’s, where you can sit at a table and have your meal delivered by a server. Pointing that out is a new way to bid for customers.\nApplebee’s, which has seen sales slump as lower-income customers pull back, is offering deals and hoping the prices will speak for themselves. Chili’s, on the other hand, is making the comparison more explicit.\nFor them, and the fast food chains they’re now competing against, the stakes are high.\nYears of price hikes have contributed to declining traffic, pushing restaurants to fight over fewer customers, according to David Henkes, a senior principal at Technomic, a food industry research and consulting firm.\n“It’s a smaller pie today than it was a year ago,” he said. “You’re competing for a share of a smaller market. And so it is more competitive.”\nFast food prices, in particular, have shot up. “Fast food has gotten really expensive,” Henkes said. “Certainly, relative to where it was 12 to 18 months ago, and also in comparison to casual dining sit-down restaurants right now.”\nIn the 12 months through March, not adjusting for seasonal swings, prices at fast food and fast casual restaurants went up 5%, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In that period full-service menu prices went up 3.2%, and grocery prices ticked up 1.2%.\nA few years ago, McDonald’s said that it could raise prices without losing too many customers. But now, it’s struggling with lower-income customers.\nRelated article\nWhat went wrong at Red Lobster\nCEO Chris Kempczinski said during a February analyst call that “the battle ground is certainly with that low-income consumer.” The following month, CFO Ian Borden conceded during another analyst call that “it’s a challenging consumer environment.”\nThe chain is working on a $5 menu to win over those customers, according to Bloomberg.\nThings aren’t much better over at Applebee’s.\nSales at US Applebee’s locations open at least a year slumped 4.6% in the first quarter. In that period, customers who earn $50,000 a year or less visited less often, and spent less when they did, Peyton said, adding that the demographic makes up about 45% of Applebee’s customers.\n“For several quarters… we’ve been asking ourselves, when will we see the impact of inflation, and the economy in general, and interest rates, on on our guest,” he said. “We really began to see it in the first quarter.”\nHe added that “we think it’s going to be a fight for share of wallet and market share all year.”\nWith fast food prices high, sit-down restaurants can make a case for themselves.\nPeople have taken their fast food price grievances to social channels, some complaining about the price of McDonald’s burgers and hash browns. Chili’s has been paying attention.\n“Our social media team has been watching the conversation that the consumer is frustrated by fast food prices,” said Kevin Hochman, president of Chili’s and CEO of its parent company, Brinker International, during an April analyst call. In response, Chili’s decided to run ads that “use fast food as a foil,” he said.\nThe chain said in an April press release that it was adding a new burger — which it described as having “twice the beef of a Big Mac and flavors fast food lovers will recognize” — to its ‘3 for me’ value menu. For $10.99, customers get the burger plus an app and a drink.\nOn X, Chili’s asked whether Chili’s is better than fast food, and promised rewards to those who said yes. Chili’s also ran video ads comparing its food favorably to fast food burgers.\nBut it might not be that easy. Getting people to go to Chili’s instead of McDonald’s may be a stretch, said Henkes.\nOne problem for chains like Chili’s and Applebee’s is that they’re not so much competing on price, as they are on time.\n“People go to sit-down restaurants, generally speaking, for different occasions, than they go to fast food restaurants,” Henkes noted. You might expect to spend an hour at a Chili’s or an Applebee’s, and breeze right through a McDonald’s.\nStill, campaigns like Chili’s can help communicate to customers that these days its food is relatively cheap.\n“Planting that seed that, ‘Hey, we’re a good value,’ I think is a good message to have,” Henkes said.\n",

        "content": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.\nA Chinese tech executive has ignited outrage in China with her fiery endorsement of toxic workplace culture, which eventually caused her to lose her own job.\nQu Jing, the former vice president and head of communications at Baidu, often dubbed China’s equivalent to Google, sparked a public relations crisis for the Chinese search engine after her controversial comments hit a raw nerve with young workers fed up with grueling hours and relentless pressure.\nIn a series of short videos posted last week on Douyin, China’s version of TikTok, Qu spoke about her devotion to her career, strict management style and unflagging demands on her direct reports.\nIn one video, she lashed out at an employee who refused to go on a 50-day business trip during the Covid-19 pandemic, when China imposed stringent travel restrictions and quarantines.\n“Why should I take my employee’s family into consideration? I’m not her mother-in-law,” Qu said. “I’m 10 years, 20 years older than you. I didn’t feel bitter about it or tired, even though I have two children. Who are you to tell me that your husband can’t stand it?”\nIn another clip, Qu shared her personal sacrifices as a working mother. She was working so hard that she forgot her elder son’s birthday and what grade her younger son was in at school. She said she didn’t regret it because she “chose to become a career woman.”\n“If you work in public relations, don’t expect weekends off,” she said in a third video. “Keep your phone on 24 hours a day, always ready to respond.”\nIn another video, she also threatened to retaliate against employees who complain about her, saying they wouldn’t get another job in the industry.\nThe American Psychological Association describes “toxic workplace” as an environment filled with infighting, intimidation and other affronts that harm productivity.\nFollowing the public outcry, Qu has lost her own job at Baidu (BIDU), a person familiar with the matter told CNN on condition of anonymity. CNN has also seen a screenshot of an internal personnel system that appears to confirm she no longer works at the company.\nBaidu did not immediately respond to a request for comment. By Thursday night, Qu had removed the title of “Baidu’s vice president” from her account on Douyin.\nQu had apologized earlier in the day and said her posts did not speak for Baidu.\nThe controversy soon became a trending topic on Douyin and Weibo, China’s X-like platform, dominating online discussions. Users criticized Qu for her aggressive and insensitive approach and accused her, and Baidu, of promoting a toxic workplace.\n“In her voice and in her tone, there’s deep indifference to and lack of empathy for the common plight of her colleagues,” said Ivy Yang, a China tech analyst and founder of consulting firm Wavelet Strategy.\n“A lot of what she said really struck a nerve, because people feel that in their own workplaces very often. The fact that she said it in a way that’s so direct and in your face, it just generated this kind of emotional response,” she said.\n“This is what the bosses are thinking, and she was merely saying it out aloud,” Yang added.\nChina’s young workers have increasingly spoken out against the culture of excessive overwork and extreme competitiveness that has come to dominate many industries, especially the tech sector.\nIn 2019, Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma drew intense criticism after endorsing the “996” trend, meaning working from 9am to 9pm six days a week, and calling it a “huge blessing.”\nYang called the backlash against Ma a “watershed moment” that led people to rethink the relationship between the workplace and themselves — a trend that has only intensified as the Chinese economy slows.\nChina’s economy grew stronger than expected at the start of this year, but problems — including a property crisis, declining foreign investment and tepid consumption — are piling up.\n“When companies demand complete loyalty, time and energy from their employees, employees feel there’s no reciprocity or reward for their sacrifice or contribution, especially when things are slowing down. That becomes the central conflict, and this conflict is also at the heart of the Baidu saga,” Yang added.\nAs public anger mounted, the videos posted on Qu’s personal Douyin account were taken down.\nAfter days of silence, Qu apologized on Thursday for “causing such a big storm” in a post on her personal account on WeChat, China’s most popular social media app.\n“I have carefully read all the opinions and comments from various platforms, and many criticisms are very pertinent. I deeply reflect on and humbly accept them,” Qu wrote.\nShe also sought to put distance between her remarks and Baidu, saying she had not sought approval beforehand and that they did not represent the company’s stance.\n“There were many inappropriate and unsuitable points made in the videos, which led to misunderstandings about the company’s values and culture, causing serious harm,” Qu wrote.\nA person familiar with the matter said Qu’s clips were part of her push to amplify Baidu’s voice on short video platforms, which have become an increasingly important channel for information dissemination in China.\nRelated article\nLabor Day isn’t the holiday it once was for China’s workers\nQu had asked all members of the PR team to create their personal accounts, according to the person, who requested anonymity.\n“The main purpose is to improve everyone’s ability to make short videos. Everyone can have different options over the content, and Cristina chose to speak about her personal experience,” said the person, referring to Qu’s English name.\nQu worked as a reporter for China’s state news agency Xinhua before switching to the PR industry. She joined Baidu in 2021 from Huawei, a Chinese tech giant known for its hard-charging “wolf culture,” where employees are expected to emulate wolves’ bloodthirsty nature, fearlessness and resilience.\nRen Zhengfei, the founder of Huawei, has previously said in interviews that its corporate culture was misunderstood. “Wolf culture,” he has said, meant “sensitivity, team spirit and resilience” and that the company didn’t have a “996 culture.”\nA former Baidu employee said Qu brought Huawei’s “aggressive” corporate culture with her to Baidu.\n“(She triggered) a pretty big culture shock. About 60% of the team left within months of her arrival,” the former employee told CNN on the condition of anonymity.\nThe PR team is expected to always be available, keep their phones on, reply to messages immediately and attend meetings at midnight and on weekends with short notice, the former employee said.\nQu also adopted the military-style language used in corporate management at Huawei, requiring the team to be “disciplined” and “able to win battles,” the former employee said.\nCNN has reached out to Huawei for comment.\nThis article has been updated with additional information.\n",

        "content": "A federal judge in Fort Worth, Texas, on Friday blocked a new Biden administration rule that would prohibit credit card companies from charging customers late fees higher than $8.\nUS District Judge Mark T. Pittman, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, granted a preliminary injunction to several business and banking organizations that allege the new rule violates several federal statutes.\nThese organizations, led by the right-leaning US Chamber of Commerce, sued the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after the rule was finalized in March. The rule, which was set to go into effect Tuesday, would save consumers about $10 billion per year by cutting fees from an average of $32, the CFPB estimated.\nA preliminary injunction means the rule can’t go into effect until a hearing is held where the case can be adjudicated in greater detail.\n“The credit card lobby’s lawsuit is an attempt to derail a rule that will save families $10 billion each year in order to continue making tens of billions of dollars in profits by charging borrowers late fees that far exceed their actual costs,” a CFPB spokesperson told CNN in a statement. “Consumers will shoulder $800 million in late fees every month that the rule is delayed — money that pads the profit margins of the largest credit card issuers. We will continue to defend this rule so that working families can stop paying excessive late fees that Congress banned more than a decade ago.”\nMaria Monaghan, the counsel for the US Chamber of Commerce Litigation Center, said in a statement Friday that the ruling was “a major win for responsible consumers who pay their credit card bills on time and businesses that want to provide affordable credit,” and that it would “continue to hold the CFPB accountable in court.”\n“It is disappointing that the court has granted this last-ditch effort by the banks to prevent these critical limits on credit card late fees from going into effect next week,” said Chuck Bell, advocacy program director for non-profit Consumer Reports. “Credit card companies have been bilking consumers out of billions of dollars in excessive late fees for far too long.”\nThe rule, first proposed in February 2023, is part of a broader push by the Biden administration to eliminate “junk fees,” considered hidden or misleading charges to consumers.\nThe new rule would apply to large credit card issuers — those with more than 1 million accounts. These companies represent more than 95% of total outstanding credit card debt, according to the CFPB.\nThe push to target credit card fees is part of the Biden administration’s efforts to ease financial burdens for many Americans. Some borrowers, especially millennials and those with lower incomes, have fallen behind on their credit card debt following more than two years of high inflation.\nThe new rule also intended to close a 2010 loophole the CFPB says has been “exploited” by credit card companies to hike fees on late payments.\nAccording to a national Consumer Reports survey published in September, one in five American adults said they had paid a credit card late fee in the previous 12 months. Eighty-two percent said they supported lowering the maximum late fee.\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\nCNN’s Matt Egan contributed to this report.\n",

        "content": "Florida A&M University is putting a purported $237.75 million donation “on pause,” after media reports and college board leaders raised concerns about the actual value of the stock gift—and the details surrounding the donor’s previous donations.\n“A decision that was made yesterday to put a pause on this activity—a hold, is more or less, is the language that was used—pending some additional information that has come to my attention,” FAMU President Larry Robinson said Thursday during an emergency school board meeting, called after media reports and school leaders raised concerns about the legitimacy of the gift.\nIt’s a stunning reversal from the fanfare last Saturday at FAMU’s commencement ceremony, when the announcement of the gift made headlines as one of the largest ever personal donations ever to a historically Black college or university.\nGregory Gerami, the 30-year-old CEO of Texas hydroponic hemp farm company Batterson Farms Corp., presented the $237.75 million stock gift via an oversized, ceremonial check to university administration members including Robinson, who called the gift “breathtaking in its generosity and its scope” via a press release the day of the donation.\nBut the jubilance quickly gave way to skepticism.\nA report from Politico noted Batterson Farms Corp. is a comparatively small company, and that its private shares are unlikely to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\nIn 2020, a notable deal involving a donor later identified as Gerami fell apart. South Carolina’s Coastal Carolina University had announced a $95 million donation from an anonymous donor, who then backed out months later. An investigation by the Myrtle Beach Sun News identified Gerami in a story that noted, among other details, that he backed out alleging racism from CCU officials—an allegation they denied.\nAt an emergency board meeting on Thursday, FAMU board of trustee and foundation members expressed their concerns and frustration about the school’s vetting process involving Gerami’s donation.\nSeveral members of the FAMU Foundation Board of Directors and Deveron Gibbons, the vice chair of the university’s Board of Trustees, said they were not informed of the donation until it was announced at commencement.\n“This meeting is taking place because no one, as I am aware of from this conversation, had any clue this was going on,” Gibbons told CNN. “We are talking about a transformational, largest in HBCU history donation: big check on stage, with press involved and big PR campaign push after the fact. If that doesn’t show that we need to take a step back and get our own house in order, I don’t know what else does.”\nGibbons has called for an independent investigation into the transaction.\n“I hope that this is a good gift. It could be transformative for the university and much needed. But we must vet the process, doing an announcement is not the first thing you do … Vet the individual. You vet the donation,” Vice Chair Gibbons said.\nBoard Chair Kristin Harper provided a statement to CNN on Friday saying, “Serious concerns have been raised regarding the validity of the gift, the adequacy of the due diligence processes and whether the Foundation Board and Board of Trustees have been provided ample oversight opportunity.”\n“I regrettably share these concerns” Harper added.\nOn May 5, just one day after the announcement at commencement, FAMU released a statement via X (formerly Twitter) insisting the university had done its “due diligence.” The statement went on to say that Gerami had transferred $237,750,000 of stocks into a FAMU account last month.\nA non-disclosure agreement requested by Gerami prohibited officials from disclosing the details to either the university’s board of trustees or the board of directors, Vice President for University Advancement Shawnta Friday-Stroud said during an emergency meeting Thursday.\n“In addition to the wealth screening that was done at the beginning, we did a more expansive screening of Mr. Gerami’s background,” Friday-Stroud said.\n“We had a discussion with Dr. Robinson, all of which has been put out on social media. We said, ‘ok, we will proceed with the decision to move forward,” Friday-Stroud added.\n“My concern is our reputation has been greatly impacted and I want to make sure that we restore faith in our alumni and all of the friends and family that support Florida A&M University,” said FAMU Foundation Board member Terry Arnold.\nWhen reached by CNN on Thursday, Gerami declined immediate comment.  He referred questions to the university and agreed to answer CNN’s questions on the following day, but he couldn’t be reached.\nFAMU’s Special Board of Trustees, which oversees the full school and the foundation, has scheduled a meeting for May 15 to discuss the donation.\nFAMU’s communications department did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on more detailed questions about the gift and the nature of the vetting process.\n",

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.\nA couple of weeks ago, I rewatched Jurassic Park for probably the 10th time since the movie came out 30 years ago. (As an aside, it really holds up — 10/10, no notes.)\nEarly in the plot, when the guests are discussing their impressions of the park, Jeff Goldblum’s character (also 10/10, just perfect) launches into a speech so prescient you could sub out all the dinosaur stuff and map it onto the modern debate around artificial intelligence.\n“Don’t you see the danger, John, inherent in what you’re doing here? Genetic power is the most awesome force the planet’s ever seen, but you wield it like a kid that’s found his dad’s gun … You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could, and before you even knew what you had, you patented it, and packaged it, and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox, and now you’re selling it.”\nAnd then comes the line that later launched a thousand memes: “Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn’t stop to think if they should.”\nNaturally, the skeptic of the group is dismissed as a Luddite and the movie carries on. (Spoiler alert: The Luddite was right!)\nAI skeptics — who are legion, and not necessarily part of the fringe tin foil hat crowd — are begging Silicon Valley to take a beat before unleashing AI to the world.\nBut tech companies, faced with the most powerful computing innovation in a generation, are running around like kids who just found their dad’s gun.\nSee here: Apple and Google — which, to be sure, deserve a lot of credit for the innovations they’ve brought to the world — have recently latched on to AI-powered features to help sell their newest tablets and smartphones. After all, throwing AI into your pitch deck is a surefire way to signal to shareholders that you’re on the cutting edge, which helps distract from the fact that your company hasn’t actually produced any significant proprietary tech in years.\nIn marketing those new devices, though, Apple and Google have lost the plot.\nApple’s new iPad advertisement made headlines for all the wrong reasons this week. The spot depicts a massive industrial hydraulic press slowly crushing a collection of objects that represent the human creative experience: There’s a piano, a record player blasting Sonny & Cher’s 1972 hit “All I Ever Need Is You,” cans of paint, books, a Space Invaders arcade console, a trumpet. The music bounces along as the machine switches on and smashes it all down. Then, the big reveal: It’s all contained in Apple’s new iPad, its thinnest and most powerful ever, thanks to its brand new AI chip.\nThe outrage online came fast and furious.\n“It is the most honest metaphor for what tech companies do to … artists, musicians, creators, writers, filmmakers: squeeze them, use them, not pay well, take everything then say it’s all created by them,” filmmaker Asif Kapadia wrote on X.\n“If you thought THIS IPad ad was weird, you should have seen the first cut where they lined up all your favorite characters and shot them,” quipped actor and producer Luke Barnett.\nApple issued a rare apology for the ad on Thursday, telling AdAge that “our goal is to always celebrate the myriad of ways users express themselves and bring their ideas to life through iPad. We missed the mark with this video, and we’re sorry.”\nEarlier in the week, CEO Tim Cook said Apple’s “outrageously powerful” M4 chip will power the company’s new AI tools. In other words: Check it out, Wall Street! People aren’t buying our stuff as much any more but just wait until we add bots!\nMeanwhile, is anyone else getting inundated with Google’s Pixel ads, which show people giddily using the smartphone’s AI photo-editing software to deceive their online followers?\nIn those ads, a guy who can’t dunk a basketball on his own uses a trampoline to get to the rim, and then edits out the trampoline. An imperfect group selfie gets everyone’s best angle and creates a composite image of a moment that never happened. A dad tosses his kid up playfully in the air, and then edits the image to seem, for reasons I still don’t understand, as if the kid went several inches higher into the air.\nThis is Google going, “look what we can do!” without any reflection on how pointless it all is. It is, at best, distortion for distortion’s sake. At worst, it’s distortion for the sake of conditioning regular people to be cool with the idea of visual misinformation.\nSmartphones and tablets were invented to enhance our lived experience, to make it easier to leave the house and go to the beach and meet up with friends — just a good camera-computer combo that fits in your pocket.\nTheoretically, our phones and tablets will become even more useful with AI, serving as virtual assistants that can do all the boring stuff we don’t want to, like summarizing all your new emails and filtering out junk. There’s a world in the not too distant future, according to AI proponents, where you can simply tell Siri or Google “order my usual breakfast from the coffee shop near the office, I’ll be there in 10 minutes to pick it up,” and the bot will do just that.\nWe’re not there yet, however. And so far, the consumer applications for AI are simultaneously underwhelming and dystopian.\nDistorted images may be harmless social media fodder, until they become propaganda spread by bad actors.\nApple is expected to announce its own ChatGPT-like tools that could be a game changer for your internet searches. But generative AI bots are also prone to give wrong answers and experience hallucinations, and no one seems to know what happens when the bots run out of human-generated data to learn from and start hoovering up their own artificial texts like a snake eating its own tail.\nThe Jeff Goldblums of the AI debate — who include some of the industry’s own pioneers — are not necessarily saying we have to smother AI and pretend it never existed. Most of them are just your friendly neighborhood skeptic, walking around going, “hey, should we really do that?”\nClearly, we weren’t invited to Apple’s or Google’s marketing meetings.\n",

        "content": "Nine hours and 30 minutes ahead of New York. Five hours and 30 minutes ahead of London. Three hours and 30 minutes behind Tokyo.\nFor more than a century, India’s clocks have officially fallen short of the full hour in calculating any time difference it has with most countries.\nAnd while it is part of a small group of nations and territories that shares that 30-minute gap - including Iran, Myanmar and parts of Australia - India is perhaps the most unlikely outlier.\nThe huge South Asian nation geographically spans what would normally be two time zones, but much to the frustration of some groups, it clings to its unusual clock settings, refusing to part ways with a system that has a very complicated past.\nIndia’s half-hour zone dates back to colonial rule of India and the era when ever-faster steamships and trains were shrinking the world.\nUntil the 19th century, India - like most places around the world - operated on very localized times, which were often different not just from city to city, but from village to village. But playing a key role in the background was East India Company, a ruthless and powerful British-owned trading organization that gradually seized control of large parts of the subcontinent.\nThe East India Company was managing the one of Asia’s first observatories, in Madras (now known as Chennai) by 1792. A decade later, the first official astronomer at this observatory declared Madras time to be “the basis of Indian Standard Time.”\nIt took a few decades, the advent of steam-powered locomotives and the commercial interests of the East India Company to make that stick, though.\n“The railroads had immense sway over the colonial powers,” says Geoff Gordon, a senior researcher in public international law at the University of Amsterdam.\n“Before the railroads won the contest for Madras time, there was a contest among the powerful cities – Bombay, Kolkata,” adds Gordon. “That fight didn’t last long.”\nMeanwhile, similar debates around the world, driven by the need to better coordinate transcontinental rail travel and improve maritime navigation, led to the establishment of the first international time zones at a conference in Washington D.C. in 1884.\nThe zones were based around the Greenwich Meridian, a line of longitude that runs north-south through the Greenwich Observatory in London. Time zones to the east of the Meridian are typically later than Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) in hourly increments.\nIt took a while for the system to be adopted globally. In India, people were still arguing over Madras Time. Despite the time’s adoption by the country’s railways, it faced considerable opposition from workers and local communities unwilling to have rigid new timings imposed on them.\n“There’s less room to maneuver as your working rhythms are linked up no longer with your boss down the street, the church bell, and the 20 other people that you go to work with,” says Gordon. “But it’s now determined by the railroad that arrives once a day.”\nEventually, Madras Time was established nationwide by 1905, with only a few remaining holdouts.\nThe start of the 20th century saw some push from scientific associations to calibrate India’s time to GMT.\nThe Royal Society in London proposed two time zones for India, both in full-hour increments from GMT and one another: Six hours ahead of GMT for the east and five hours for the west of the country.\nThat recommendation was rejected by the colonial government, which opted for a unified time that sat squarely in the middle: five and a half hours ahead of GMT.\n“It strikes me as sort of typical of the colonial mindset,” says Gordon.\nAnd so, in 1906, India’s British rulers introduced what is now known as Indian Standard Time.\nWhile the 30-minute difference is a lingering remnant of India’s colonial past, some countries have changed their own time zones more recently.\nVenezuela’s former president Hugo Chávez set clocks back by half an hour in 2007 to give schoolchildren more daylight time, a move that was later reversed by current leader Nicolas Maduro.\nIn 2015, North Korea moved out of sync with South Korea by creating “Pyongyang Time,” putting the country eight and a half hours ahead of GMT instead of nine.\nIndia’s colonial-era time zone decision making, however, reflected a chorus of political, scientific and commercial voices both from within the government and outside of it, Gordon says.\nHe compares India during this period to “Brazil,” the 1985 dark dystopian sci-fi fantasy film directed by Terry Gilliam, or the comically complicated contraptions drawn by US cartoonist Rube Goldberg.\n“It’s just this unbelievably haphazard Rube Goldberg-esque construction, that is built up through lots of different inputs, lots of people acting opportunistically, lots of people acting naively,” he adds. “There was a lot of weirdness and wildness.”\nIndia’s single time-zone has been the subject of much debate over the years, with populations in the northeast demanding a separate time zone given how wide the country is.\nThough this problem isn’t unique to India: geographically, China is the third largest in the world and still only has one time zone, which a 2014 study argues is symbolic of the state’s centralized control over people’s everyday lives.\nIndia’s official timekeepers, the National Physical Laboratory, even called for two separate time zones on account of this issue, citing reports of India’s time “badly affecting” the lives of people in the northeast.\nIt proposed two time zones instead: five and a half hours ahead of GMT for one side of India, and six and a half hours for another, specifically what they’ve described as “extreme northeast regions,” including areas like Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.\n“Despite geographical differences—such as the sun rising and setting nearly two hours earlier in the northeast compared to Gujarat—both regions adhere to the same time-zone,” says Maulik Jagnani, an assistant professor of economics at Tufts University.\nJagnani published a widely cited paper in 2019 highlighting the impact of sunlight on natural circadian rhythms in India, with a focus on children.\n“This setup affects children’s sleep patterns […] children exposed to later sunsets go to bed later,” adds Jagnani. “Fixed school and work start times do not allow for corresponding adjustments in wake-up times, leading to reduced sleep and poorer educational outcomes.”\nThe NPL also recognized this issue, adding that the circadian rhythm’s impact on health and work efficiency, is tied to the “overall socio-economic development of the region.”\nHowever, it looks like India’s unusual time zone is here to stay. When the question of introducing two time zones was put to India’s parliament in 2019, a government committee rejected the concept over unspecified “strategic reasons.”\n",

        "content": "Amelia Showalter was debating whether asking a stranger to join her on a ghost tour was a mad idea.\nShe was sitting in a crowded bar in Edinburgh’s Old Town, the last dregs of a glass of Scottish whisky in front of her.\nAlso in front of her: Lucas Demaria. An Argentinian DJ she’d just met. He was a fellow Edinburgh tourist and a self-confessed “big nerd.” And he was someone Amelia was “very much liking talking with”\nAmelia swallowed the last of her whisky, and in turn swallowed her reservations. She wanted to carry on her conversation with Lucas. And she was in a city she’d never visited before. If he said no, it didn’t matter. What did she have to lose?\n“I’m heading on this ghost tour soon,” Amelia said. “Do you want to come? It’s supposed to be spooky.”\nLucas raised his eyebrow.\n“Not that I actually believe in ghosts,” Amelia added quickly.\n“Sure,” said Lucas, laughing. “Why not.”\nThe next thing they knew, Amelia and Lucas were walking, shoulder to shoulder, down Edinburgh’s cobbled streets. Dusk was falling and the city, with its stone spired buildings and hills and crags in the distance, had a dreamy atmosphere.\nThe ghost tour focused on the city’s bloody history, with the guide recounting the chilling tale of grave robbers Burke and Hare, stories of plague and taking the group into Edinburgh’s eerie Blair Street underground vaults, a series of abandoned chambers beneath the city’s South Bridge.\n“You’d think it wouldn’t be very romantic,” Amelia tells CNN Travel today. “But it was, because you’re kind of pretending to be scared.”\nAmelia and Lucas stood closer and closer as the tour progressed. Their hands brushed against each other, but didn’t quite touch.\nAnd then, tour over, the two ducked into a bar. They sat together, drinking and chatting into the night.\n“And at some point I was like, ‘We should make out,’” says Amelia.\n“And I was like, ‘Yes,’” says Lucas, laughing.\n“I feel like at that point we were both like, ‘Come on, we’re going to kiss,’” says Amelia.\n“It was going that way for sure,” says Lucas.\nAmelia and Lucas went on the spontaneous ghost tour on June 4, 2018, which just so happened to be Amelia’s 35th birthday.\nBack then, Amelia lived and worked in Washington D.C., running a political data consultancy. She’d previously worked on President Barack Obama’s campaign in 2012.\nFrom time to time, Amelia’s work led to interesting travel opportunities – and that’s how she ended up visiting the UK in June 2018. She got invited to speak at a conference in London, and decided to tack on some extra days exploring the UK.\n“I was like, ‘Well, if I’m going to be sort of traveling on my own, when I turn 35, I should do something fun – I should go celebrate somehow,’” says Amelia.\nAmelia decided to attend a “Game of Thrones” convention in Manchester in the north of England (“I love sci-fi, fantasy, all that stuff,” she says). Then she headed up to Scotland to squeeze in a day of solo travel in Edinburgh.\n“I just had the one day there,” recalls Amelia. “So I went to the National Museum of Scotland. I ate some haggis. And then I wanted to have some Scotch.”\nAmelia figured it would be fitting to sample a 35-year-old Scottish whisky on the day of her 35th birthday. She Googled Edinburgh’s best whisky bars and the internet suggested Edinburgh institution Bow Bar, situated on the city’s colorful, winding Victoria Street. Amelia headed in that direction, pushed open the blue door and grabbed a seat at the bar.\nShe’d just started sipping her drink when she spotted Lucas. He caught her eye because he was – unlike almost everyone else inside Bow Bar– drinking a beer.\n“I just thought it was so strange that this person was drinking a beer in a whisky bar,” says Amelia. “I really wanted to know, ‘What beer is so good that you’re doing that instead of drinking some whisky?’”\nWithout really thinking twice, Amelia turned to the stranger and asked the question.\nIn June 2018, Lucas Demaria was 36 and starting to “give up on trying to find the one,” as he puts it.\nDisillusioned with romance, Lucas decided to focus on exploring the world.\n“I started traveling late in my life,” Lucas tells CNN Travel. “And it just blew my mind.”\nHe arrived in Edinburgh for the first time on the morning of June 4, 2018. He’d heard the city was scenic, but he couldn’t quite believe how spectacular it really was.\n“I made it there and was like, ‘Oh my God, this is a beautiful city,’” recalls Lucas. “I had in my mind eating haggis, so I dropped the bag in the hostel, started walking, ate haggis, and then I told myself, ‘Okay, I need to drink some scotch’ But I’m very into beer. And I know really nothing about scotch.”\nLucas stumbled across the Bow Bar while wandering around on foot. It looked like the place to go to satisfy his whisky quest. But once inside, the range of options was pretty intimidating. Lucas stared at the bottles, mystified. In the end he ordered a beer to enjoy while he mulled over the whisky options.\nWhen Amelia struck up conversation, questioning his drink choice, Lucas told her a truncated version of this explanation. He’d actually been debating how to strike up conversation with Amelia before she got in there first – he’d noticed her almost right away: “Sitting at the end of the bar, a beautiful lady,” as he recalls it.\nDrink orders explained, the conversation moved on. Lucas was wearing a “Star Wars” T-shirt, and Amelia commented on it, saying she was also a fan.\n“I showed her my ‘Star Wars’ tattoos,” says Lucas.\nAt the time, Amelia was into cosplay – recreating and wearing the costumes of fictional characters. So after she’d admired the tattoos, she got out her phone, and showed Lucas some photos of her hand-sewn “Star Wars” costumes.\n“It was a nerd meeting,” says Lucas, laughing.\nFrom there, the two talked a bit about their impressions of the UK, realizing along the way that they shared the same favorite British band: The Beatles.\nThe conversation flowed in a way that surprised them both – neither Lucas or Amelia usually spoke to strangers in bars.\n“It’s not in my nature,” says Lucas. “But I would do that while traveling.”\n“Yeah, I would never just go start talking to a random person in a bar in D.C., which is where I lived at the time,” agrees Amelia. “But when I travel, I’m just a much more open-minded person.”\nIt was this outlook that prompted Amelia to invite Lucas to join her on the ghost tour – and prompted Lucas to say yes.\nAfter the evening of whisky drinking, ghost stories and growing closer, Amelia and Lucas had to say their goodbyes. Amelia was heading down to London for her conference, while Lucas still had a few more days exploring Edinburgh. The two exchanged contact details, and started communicating via messaging app WhatsApp.\n“First it was just text, for a couple of weeks, with some photos,” recalls Amelia.\nAnd then, one day when she was back home in Washington D.C., Amelia saw a voice recording from Lucas pop up on her phone.\nVoice notes are pretty commonplace in the US now, but in 2018, Amelia had never come across the concept. In contrast, Lucas regularly sent voice notes to his friends in Argentina.\nAmelia clicked play, and Lucas’ voice echoed around her bedroom. Her heart started racing.\n“To hear his voice and everything, I was just so excited,” she recalls. “And it made me realize, ‘Oh, I really like this guy.’ Because when I was hearing his voice again, it was just so wonderful.”\nBefore long, Amelia and Lucas were video calling regularly.\n“We’d be talking for an hour, a couple of hours,” recalls Amelia.\n“Several times a week,” says Lucas.\nRelated article\nThey fell in love on vacation but went their separate ways. Four years later, she sent him an email: ‘Remember me?’\nAmelia’s a data scientist by trade, and even while caught up in the heady emotions of falling for Lucas, she tried to think things through logically.\n“When we met, I started making a little spreadsheet of how certain I felt that he was the love of my life,” recalls Amelia.\n“I wasn’t being overly romantic – the first entry was 10% – a 10% chance Lucas was the love of my life. Which is actually really high if you think about it, just because what are the odds that any person is the love of your life?”\nAs she spent more and more time WhatsApping Lucas, Amelia added more data to the spreadsheet.\n“It went up to 20%,” she says. “I kept plotting it out.”\nBut Amelia knew the only way of securing a higher score would be to see Lucas again. The prospect had been raised on their video calls – but they had to figure out the logistics.\nLucas’ DJ job was always busier during his Argentinian summer months, starting November through to January. If he was going to embark on another vacation, it needed to be before then.\nAmelia considered visiting Lucas, and Lucas debated visiting Amelia, but ultimately the two decided meeting in a third country was the best plan.\n“So in October of 2018, we scheduled a 10-day trip to Peru together,” recalls Amelia. “Our second date.”\nOn their respective flights to Peru, Amelia and Lucas played back their months of video conversations in their head. They were both excited, but also apprehensive.\n“I think my biggest fear, going to Peru, was, ‘What if I get there, and all of a sudden, it just feels wrong? Like I’ve built this whole thing up in my head,’” recalls Amelia. “Because you can kind of do that with long distance.”\nBut as soon as Amelia saw Lucas, her fears dissolved.\n“Immediately, I was like, ‘Oh, no, this is great,’” Amelia says. “Within the first two days, when we were walking around Lima, it was like, ‘This feels really serious.’ And it felt good.”\nIn between hiking the Inca Trail, marveling at Machu Picchu and eating mountains of delicious Peruvian food, Amelia and Lucas started talking about marriage.\n“By the end of the trip, we were not exactly engaged. But we were sort of engaged to be engaged,” says Amelia.\nShe updated her spreadsheet: the percentage was steadily climbing.\nThe idea of marrying someone you’d only met twice seemed bizarre, but both Amelia and Lucas felt calm and excited when they considered their future together – with just a dash of surprise at the whole thing. After all, their lives were taking a direction neither of them had anticipated – it was a happy shift, but a shift all the same.\n“I never thought about getting married either until I met her, basically,” says Lucas.\nAmelia echoes this.\n“I had really gotten fine with the idea of being single,” she says. “I was like, ‘Well, maybe I’m just going to be one of those people that doesn’t meet anybody. And that’s okay. I’m just going to have a life on my own.’”\nThe future suddenly looked very different for both of them.\nIn February 2019, Lucas came to D.C. to visit Amelia. He met her parents, friends and loved ones. Not long after, Amelia visited Lucas in Argentina.\nIt was during that trip that the couple officially got engaged. They picked out the ring together, making official something both of them knew was on the cards from pretty much day one.\nExplaining this feeling to loved ones was sometimes a little “strange,” says Amelia. She recalls saying: “I met this guy in Scotland, but he’s from Argentina. And I think we might get married” and fielding disbelieving responses, and some concerns.\n“It was just definitely a strange thing to explain to people,” Amelia reflects today. “But I think also, it’s such a different thing when you’re in your 30s – because you know yourself better. I think it would be ill advised to do that when you’re 20, because you don’t really know yourself and it’s easy to get kind of caught up. But I think after 15, 20 years of dating, you know yourself – and you have had enough other relationships to know what doesn’t work.”\nRelated article\nShe swore she’d never get married. Then, she traveled to London and a surprise meeting changed her mind\nAmelia and Lucas were married at a small courthouse ceremony in Washington D.C. in the summer of 2019. Then, four months later, the couple threw a big D.C. celebration for family and friends.\nAs a DJ, Lucas had worked hundreds of weddings. He’d seen stuff he liked, stuff he didn’t like – and all in all, knew what added up to a great evening. Amelia was on the same page. The couple wanted the evening to feel like, “a night at the bar with all your friends,” as Amelia puts it.\nAmelia and Lucas rented a cafe-bar called Emissary in D.C. for the evening.\n“We had endless appetizers,” recalls Amelia. “So there wasn’t a sit down dinner. It was just food whenever you want, open bar, with all the usual stuff that’s on the menu, and espresso when you want because it was also a cafe.”\nLucas mixed the music in advance, while Amelia made her own wedding dress using the sewing skills she’d perfected from her years of cosplay.\nAnd when she was planning her speech and considering what to say, Amelia dug out the spreadsheets she’d compiled when she first met Lucas.\n“I printed signs with the graphs I made,” she says. “Everyone thought it was very funny.”\nMeanwhile Lucas’ best friend from Argentina made a speech in which he recounted the moment Lucas first told him he’d met Amelia – and how he’d known she was someone special based on the excited, heartfelt tone of Lucas’ voice.\nThe wedding also nodded to Amelia and Lucas’ first conversation in Bow Bar about their shared love of “Star Wars.” Midway through their first dance – to The Beatles’ “In My Life” – the couple interrupted proceedings to have a mini lightsaber battle.\n“Secretly, we had hidden some lightsabers with a couple of our friends,” explains Amelia, laughing. “So halfway through the dance. We did a little lightsaber action, little tiny dance fight, and then back to dancing.”\n“You wouldn’t think that lightsabers would work with the Beatles in my life. When I say it out loud, it sounds like a really weird combination, but it was really fun.”\nA month or so later, Lucas and Amelia relocated from D.C. to Seattle, Washington, where Amelia had grown up and where her parents still lived.\nShe was ready to leave the US capital, and figured if she and Lucas might have a kid, it’d be nice to be closer to family.\nAs for Lucas, serendipitously, Seattle happened to be a perfect fit. He loved grunge music (“I was a kid in the ‘90s,” he shrugs), IPA beers and black coffee. He was instantly “so happy” there.\nRelated article\nTwo strangers met in Berlin. Here’s how they ended up having ‘three weddings’\nCut to today and Lucas and Amelia still live in Seattle. Lucas set up his own successful Seattle-based DJ business, while Amelia’s still working in political data analysis. The couple are also kept busy by their three-year-old son Jude.\nHe’s named – of course – for The Beatles song, “Hey Jude.” The name seemed appropriate, given Lucas and Amelia both love The Beatles and talked about the band that first night in Edinburgh.\n“It’s so funny because those things – the fact that we both love ‘Star Wars’ and The Beatles – it mattered a lot at the beginning because it was like, ‘Oh, we have these things in common,’” reflects Amelia. “And now I don’t think about them so much, because we just have a whole life together.”\n“I think shared values are, in the end, way more important than a shared taste for movies,” agrees Lucas.\nIt’s their similar  approach to life, Lucas suggests, that’s led him and Amelia to the happiness they continue to enjoy today.\nPlus, while they still enjoy watching the same TV and movies, Amelia and Lucas’ tastes do occasionally diverge. Amelia loves a Broadway musical, for example, which isn’t Lucas’ vibe. Meanwhile Amelia’s never quite got her head around Lucas’ passion for heavy metal.\nThe pandemic, and then the birth of Jude, put a pause on Lucas and Amelia’s desire to travel the world together post-wedding. But in 2023, the couple embarked on a long-awaited “amazing” Honeymoon to Japan, leaving Jude in the care of his grandparents.\nAlso on the travel agenda is one day returning to Edinburgh, this time with Jude in tow. Amelia and Lucas want to show their son where they met, and retrace the steps of their first evening together.\n“We’re going to take Jude to the bar,” says Lucas.\n“Put him on the bar,” adds Amelia, laughing. “And say, ‘This is your fault.’”\n“Free drinks for us,” jokes Lucas.\nIn reality, they’ll probably hold off on returning to Edinburgh until Jude’s old enough to enjoy the trip in his own right.\n“Maybe on our 10 year anniversary, or something,” says Amelia. “There’s so much of Scotland I’ve never seen, so we definitely want to go back there someday.”\nSomething Lucas and Amelia still marvel at is the idea that they’re so compatible, despite the fact they grew up thousands of miles from each other – and only happened to be in the same bar, in the same city, in the same country by happenstance.\n“It’s so weird, he’s just a random guy in a bar,” says Amelia.\n“From a different country,” adds Lucas.\nNeither are who the other envisaged when they imagined a prospective life partner.\nLucas – who recalls breaking up with an ex who lived 15 minutes away from him because he felt like they were from “different worlds” – finds it incongruous yet incredible that he ended up marrying someone he met on vacation.\nAs for Amelia, she always figured she’d end up with a fellow Ivy League graduate, who also worked in the D.C. politics world.\n“It wasn’t like, ‘Oh I must be with that kind of person,’” she says. “But you just get an idea of, ‘This is probably who I will end up with.’ I never would have assumed it would be a DJ from Argentina.”\nAll this suggests, says Amelia and Lucas, that compatibility has little to do with shared backgrounds. It goes back to that shared values thing and being on the same wavelength, they say – and the idea of being open, of willingly embarking on adventures.\n“I mean, it doesn’t mean you’re going to absolutely find the love of your life from traveling,” says Lucas.\n“You could find the love of one night, and that can be fun too,” says Amelia.\nAmelia and Lucas are also grateful that their relationship continues to develop as they grow together.\n“We were in love,” says Lucas of their 2018 selves. “But we didn’t know each other 100% as we do know.”\n“I always felt certain about you,” says Amelia to Lucas. “But I’m more in love with you all the time. It’s wonderful.”\n",

        "content": "One man’s loss is another man’s gain, goes the saying – and as Boeing seems caught in a spiral of bad news, one aircraft manufacturer is quietly powering ahead.\nBrazilian manufacturer Embraer, which specializes in smaller narrow-body passenger jets, has been clocking up major announcements, and will soon comprise the entire regional fleet of American Airlines.\nAnd now, rumor has it that the company might be setting its sights even higher. A Wall Street Journal report last week suggested that Embraer – currently the world’s third largest aircraft manufacturer – was planning a new narrow-body jet that could “compete head-on” with the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 Max, which have cornered the global market.\nEmbraer has denied the reports. Yet the company’s star is certainly on the rise.\nOn May 2, Embraer delivered its 1,800th E-Jet aircraft: an E190-E2, to Royal Jordanian Airlines. Five days later, Singapore-based Scoot Airlines took delivery of its first Embraer: another E190-E2, the quietest and most fuel-efficient single-aisle jet on the market.\nEven in the US, where Boeing has traditionally ruled the roost, Embraer has been making waves.\nOn March 26, United announced a refurb of its Embraer E175 fleet to add larger overhead bins on its Skywest-operated planes. The move will increase storage space by 80%. Skywest is the world’s largest operator of Embraer’s E175 aircraft.\nThen there’s American Airlines, which announced the purchase of 90 E175 aircraft in March, making AA’s entire regional fleet Embraer by the end of the decade.\nThe love-in continued in April, when CEO Robert Isom praised the Brazilian company during a quarterly call. “The rest of the industry… can learn a lot from them,” he said, while also delivering a public rebuke to Boeing to, “Get your act together.”\nIt’s almost as if as Boeing’s star continues to fall, Embraer’s continues to rise. But can it go even bigger – and turn the “Big Two” of the skies into a “Big Three?”\nTo do so would require coming up with a new, larger aircraft to rival the 737MAX and the A320. At the moment, Embraer aircraft carry a maximum of 146 passengers, compared to the MAX’s minimum 172. It’d also mean scaling up – Embraer delivered 181 jets in 2023, of which 64 were commercial aircraft. Before the pandemic, it was delivering around 90 commercial aircraft per year.\nYet as Boeing struggles to regain public trust, experts say there’s room for someone else to grab a place in the market.\n“The door is open a little for a [Boeing] 737 replacement,” says Robert van der Linden, curator of air transportation at the National Air and Space Museum. Although he notes that it could close again “quickly,” and that debuting a new aircraft is a colossal task for manufacturers, he believes that Embraer might uniquely be capable of making headway in the aviation market – it already has the contacts and reputation.\nRodrigo Silva e Souza, Embraer’s VP of marketing who’s responsible for strategic planning, doesn’t deny that he’s looking at potential options, but says, “That’s my job.”\n“Designing, producing and delivering high-quality, highly reliable products is in our DNA, and I think that’s bringing some contrasts with what we’re seeing with other players,” he says, carefully.\nBut he tells CNN that aircraft take at least a decade to design and build, so while the current gap looks promising, they won’t be jumping in feet-first.\n“Designing an aircraft takes 10 years, and in 10 years from now the situation is completely different.\n“If someone had designed this before, they could be jumping in now, but you don’t decide to make a new aircraft and have it ready next year,” he says.\nSo could Embraer muscle its way to the top? It’s made it against the odds so far.\nFor an aircraft manufacturer with such a toehold in the US market, Embraer’s origins might come as a surprise.\nBased in São José dos Campos, in the state of São Paulo, the company was founded in 1969 by the Brazilian government – its name is a portmanteau of Empresa Brasileira de Aeronáutica (Aeronautics Corporation of Brazil) – on the back of the development of the Bandeirante, a twin-turboprop aircraft.\nInitially used for the Brazilian military, the Bandeirante entered commercial service in 1972. With 15-21 seats, it was aimed at “commuter companies,” says Alvaro Romero, a Chilean aviation historian.\nRelated article\nChina’s C919 passenger jet to make first commercial flight\nThe company was privatized in 1994, and went public on the stock market in 2000. By that time, says van der Linden, it had already cracked the US.\n“They found a very comfortable niche market for regional jets,” he says.\n“It was very wise not to compete directly with Boeing and Airbus. Try and break into an oligopoly and chances are you’re going to get squashed.\n“Regional jets carry anything from 35 to almost 150 passengers and Embraer grabbed hold of that market.”\nIn the regional market, Embraer’s primary competitor was Canada’s Bombardier, which sold its commercial manufacturing arm to Airbus in 2020.\nIn fact, Embraer nearly made a similar deal with Boeing in 2019, when the US giant signed up to take an 80% stake in the Brazilian company’s commercial division – before reneging on the deal in 2020. You could call it Embraer’s lucky escape.\nNow, says Silva e Souza, Embraer’s main rival is Airbus itself.\nSo how has Embraer succeeded where others have failed? For van der Linden, Brazil was far-sighted. “As early as the 1940s, the Brazilian government was interested in establishing aviation and aerospace manufacturing,” he says. Government backing meant that Embraer had money to produce quality planes from the outset. “It developed a very well-deserved reputation,” he says.\nFor aero historian Mario Overall, a member of the Latin American Aviation Historical Society, Embraer is an “exceptional” company. He puts that global success down to several factors, from its diverse portfolio (Embraer still makes military airplanes and private jets) to its designs, export strategy and outsourcing supply, keeping costs down. “Its versatility has enabled Embraer to cater to a wide range of customers,” he says. Yet he calls taking on Boeing a “daunting” process and doesn’t believe it’ll develop a larger narrowbody.\nWith major US carriers operating small planes on regional routes, Embraer’s focus on sub-200 passenger planes – its largest, the E195, has a maximum capacity of 146 seats – is a perfect fit for the US market. They’re also used on less-trafficked routes in Latin America and Europe, as well as at difficult airports. At London City, which requires a steep 5.5 degree approach for the short runway, 85% of the aircraft are Embraers.\nAnd while, by the numbers, AA and United are its top clients, Embraer’s biggest airline fan is perhaps LOT Polish Airlines, where 43 of its 75-strong fleet are Embraers (this week, it announced another three).\n“These aircraft have been instrumental in our strategy to expand our network, allowing us to confidently launch new routes, even to destinations with initially lower demand. The Embraer fleet’s reliability, efficiency, and passenger appeal make them indispensable,” says LOT spokesperson Krzysztof Moczulski.\nIt’s not just airlines; plenty of frequent flyers have a crush, too.\n“In Europe, it’s the best way to fly economy,” says Koen Berghuis of the 82-seater ERJ-175, which he flies on regularly with LOT.\n“You have so much legroom, shoulder room, and some airlines have really comfortable seating. You don’t feel like you’re in a sardine can, which I feel on the Boeing 737 MAX. But the 2-2 configuration is the main benefit,” says Berghuis, editor-in-chief of travel blog Paliparan.\nThat’s right – the dreaded middle seat simply doesn’t exist. In first class on American and United, Embraer goes one better – it’s a 1-2 configuration. The smaller jets even have 1-2 in economy, too.\nRelated article\nWhen is a car faster than a plane? When it’s electric\nTravel vlogger Paul Lucas actively seeks to fly Embraer.\n“It’s really pleasant to fly on – it has really big windows that mean loads of cabin light,” he says (van der Linden compares the windows of a bijou Embraer to those on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner).\n“They feel like mainline jets inside, but have the operational benefits of a regional jet,” Lucas says of Embraer’s E-jet range. “They probably should get more of a profile.”\nFor him, a key reason why Embraer doesn’t get the same hype as the Big Two is that it’s Brazilian.\n“In the US, Boeing is a flagship company – Americans were proud of it until recently. And Airbus is pan-European,” he says.\n“Then there’s Embraer.”\nAs Boeing spirals, is there a chance for Embraer to break through?\nSilva e Souza says that the company’s current focus is the Energia project, which aims to develop 30-seater hybrid-electric aircraft by 2030, slashing the aircraft carbon emissions by 30% (90% if using SAF). A hydrogen-fuel-cell version is planned for 2035, with a 50-seater scheduled for 2040.\nHe also predicts an untapped market for small, sustainable planes to replace long drives.\nAnd while he insists that the company is concentrating on “harvesting” following “10-15 years of very strong development” – he’s not denying that they’re eyeing all options.\nAt the Dubai Airshow in November, he hinted that the company was scanning markets such as the Middle East, where it says that only 16% of flights are full – meaning smaller aircraft could make certain routes more profitable. Meanwhile the company’s 2023 Market Outlook report suggests that “the future lies in the middle” – which Silva e Souza defines as 100-150 seats.\nCould that “middle” get a little bigger, though? The troubled Boeing MAX starts at 172 seats – not far off Embraer’s E2-195, which seats 146.\nThe only other potential competitor is Comac’s C919, currently only certified to operate in China. Silva e Souza believes that Chinese-made aircraft will make it into the global market, but “it’ll take a long time.”\nHe doesn’t deny that Embraer is monitoring the market, however. “We speak to investors. We keep looking: smaller, bigger, commercial, defense – for each we talk to partners who will help build the business case. But we’ve done nothing specifically on the [MAX rival].\n“We’re confident in our capabilities. But it’s very different taking decisions on the current situation for a product that will come 10 years from now.”\nIf they did take the plunge, they have an army of fans waiting to take flight.\n",

        "content": "Can an iron structure stand tall for 1,600 years without rusting, despite being exposed to the elements?\nIt seems implausible, considering the supposed lack of technology at the time of its construction.\nYet, inside New Delhi’s UNESCO-listed Qutb Minar complex – a collection of historic monuments and buildings built in the early 13th century in the city’s southern Mehrauli district – one mysterious structure stands as a testament to this very enigma.\nVisitors to the courtyard of the complex’s Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque will immediately spot an imposing 7.2-meter, six-ton iron pillar with a decorative top that’s even older than the complex.\nRemarkably, the pillar is now as pristine as the day it was forged, defying both age and environmental adversities, including the Indian capital’s intense temperatures and increasing pollution. Dating back to the 5th century, its remarkable resilience continues to captivate travelers today.\nTypically, iron and iron alloy structures exposed to the air or moisture oxidize over time, rendering them coated in rust unless they are protected, like the Eiffel Tower, by layers of special paint. Scientists both in India and abroad began studying the iron pillar in Delhi in 1912 to try to figure out why it hadn’t corroded.\nIt wasn’t until 2003 that experts at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in the northern city of Kanpur cracked the mystery, revealing the answer in the journal Current Science.\nThey found that the pillar, primarily made of wrought iron, has a high phosphorus content (about 1%), and lacks sulfur and magnesium, unlike modern iron. Additionally, ancient craftsmen used a technique called “forge-welding.”\nThat means they heated and hammered the iron, keeping the high phosphorus content intact, a method uncommon in modern practices.\nArcheo-metallurgist R. Balasubramaniam, who authored the report, said that this unconventional approach contributed to the pillar’s enduring strength.\nRelated article\nIndia is a hiker’s dream destination. Here are a dozen of its most epic trails\nA thin layer of “misawite,” a compound of iron, oxygen and hydrogen, was also found on the pillar’s surface, he said. This layer is formed catalytically by the presence of high phosphorus in the iron and the absence of lime, thus further enhancing the pillar’s durability.\nBalasubramaniam lauded the metallurgists for their ingenuity, describing the pillar as “a living testament to India’s ancient metallurgical prowess.”\nIts durability is evidenced by historical accounts, including an incident in the 18th century when a cannonball fired at the pillar reportedly failed to break it, showcasing the impressive strength of this ancient monument.\nToday, the pillar serves as the emblem of scientific organizations like the National Metallurgical Laboratory and the Indian Institute of Metals.\nBeyond its metallurgical intrigue, the origin of the Iron Pillar is also veiled in mystery. One widely circulated account traces it back to the Gupta Empire, particularly under the reign of Chandragupta II, also known as Vikramaditya, around the 4th and 5th centuries.\nAccording to this tale, the pillar was erected in the Varah Temple of Udayagiri Caves, near Vidisha in Madhya Pradesh, as a victory monument dedicated to the Hindu deity Lord Vishnu. It’s said to have once borne a statue of Garuda, the mythical eagle mount of Vishnu, on its top, though this figure has been lost to history.\nAnother theory, proposed by heritage activist and educator Vikramjit Singh Rooprai, suggests it may have been bought by Varāhamihira, a renowned astronomer in the court of King Vikramaditya.\n“One of his books, the ‘Surya Siddhanta,’ details methods for calculating celestial positions, eclipses, and other astronomical phenomena - and it is believed that he used a tall pillar in his calculations,” says Vikramjit.\n“Therefore, upon his migration from Vidisha to Mihirapuri (now Mehrauli), where he founded an observatory, there exists a likelihood that he brought the pillar with him for continued use in his studies and calculations.”\nRelated article\nDevil’s dung or dinner delight? The story behind hing, one of India’s most divisive ingredients\nAdditionally, some historical records credit notable figures like Raja Anangpal of the Tomar dynasty, and Muslim rulers such as Iltutmish and Qutbuddin Aibek, for the relocation of the pillar to the Qutb complex.\nIt’s also been mentioned in the arts. In the epic poem “Prithviraj Raso,” penned by Chand Bardai, a courtier in the Chahamana dynasty under King Prithviraj Chauhan, the Iron Pillar holds great significance.\n“Bardai describes the Iron Pillar in Raso as a nail holding the Earth on the hoof of Sheshnag, the serpent king in Hindu mythology,” says Vikramjit.\n“Raso recounts how Raja Anangpal tried to uproot this nail despite warnings from Brahmins of dire consequences. When it was pulled out, revealing a red base believed to be Sheshnag’s blood, panic ensued, fearing Earth’s destruction. Anangpal quickly ordered its reinstallation, but it was not properly secured, resulting in it becoming loose. Thus, Bardai suggests that this incident inspired the colloquial name ‘Dilli’ for Delhi, which is a pun on the word ‘dhilli’, meaning ‘loose’ in Hindi.”\nAccording to one legend, if you stand with your back against the pillar and wrap your arms around it, making sure your fingers touch each other, your wish will come true – a tradition that imbues the pillar with spiritual significance beyond its historical value.\nHowever, the ASI (Archeological Survey of India) has put a fence around the pillar to minimize human impact.\nConservation architect and heritage expert, Pragya Nagar, finds the pillar’s preservation remarkable within the complex, despite the demolition and reconstruction of its surroundings over the years.\n“If we do look at the technique that was used to create the pillar from a fresh perspective, beyond mere acknowledgment of its ancient origins, we may discover avenues to leverage similar methods for the development of sustainable material alternatives, considering the environmental harm associated with processes like metal extraction,” she tells CNN.\n“It is imperative to look at history beyond relics and monuments that simply need to be conserved and marveled at, but as repositories of traditional knowledge and indigenous practices. This holistic approach has the potential to pave the way towards a more sustainable future.”\n",

        "content": "They’d always planned to retire somewhere outside the US, but when the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020, Cynthia Wilson and her husband Craig Bjork felt compelled to bring their plans forward.\nThe couple, who married in 2009, had already chosen Portugal as their intended destination after Googling “best places for Americans to retire to” and finding that the European country – a place Wilson had never visited – was high on the list.\n“It’s funny because I’ve been to like 33 countries, and almost all of northwest Europe,” Wilson, originally from Seattle, tells CNN Travel. “I’ve been to countries like Estonia, but I almost knew nothing about Portugal.\nThankfully, her husband, a former US marine, “knew everything about it.”\n“It was an ‘Aha’ moment for me,” says the retired chef and restaurant owner, explaining that Bjork was stationed in Lisbon during the late 1970s and “had regaled me with stories about his life there.”\nThe couple, who met when they were both in their 50s, initially bonded over their love for travel, and Wilson says that it’s been a “never ending conversation” ever since.\n“We started talking about our travels,” she recounts. “And we still are talking about our travels.”\nOnce they were married, Wilson and Bjork, who were based in Kansas at the time, began to think more seriously about the type of life that they wanted to have during their retirement years.\n“We were both watching our parents spend their entire savings and pensions on medical care,” says Wilson, explaining that they did a lot of research into the cost of living in Portugal and found it to be more favorable.\n“And, in Portugal, we could keep our money for travel. We were required to have private medical insurance as part of the visa process.\n“But we also would have access to the national system, particularly for hospitalizations.”\nWilson and Bjork, who previously ran a food truck named LumpiaPalooza and the Parsnipity Cafe in Wichita, Kansas, initially gave themselves six years “to plan and dream about moving to Portugal.”\nHowever, they opted to speed things up “rather than to go into debt to keep the business alive” during the pandemic.\n“We decided to retire two years early,” explains Wilson. “So we retired in 2020 and started the paperwork.”\nThe couple applied for a D7 visa, also known as the “Retirement visa,” which required them to meet specific requirements, including either proof of purchase of a property in the country or a rental agreement of at least 12 months.\nThey put a lot of time and energy into choosing which town to live in, eventually settling on the small town of Marinha Grande, located on the Silver Coast close to famed surfing beach Nazare.\nWilson explains that they were keen to move somewhere that they could integrate themselves into the local community and spend time with Portuguese people rather than other Americans.\n“Many people moving to Portugal like to call themselves ‘expats’ and spend their time at ‘Meetups’ where they can whine to other ‘expats’ about how no one in Portugal speaks English, how they can’t find their exact brand of tinned beans and accuse the ‘natives’ of being impossible to get to know,” she says.\n“This was not the life we wanted. We wanted to be immigrants, people moving to a new country to become a part of their culture and community.”\nOnce their visa had been approved and border restrictions had lifted, the couple moved to Marinha Grande, which has a population of just under 40,000, in January 2022.\nThey initially stayed in an Airbnb, which cost them around $800 per month, and soon found themselves hosting some of the friends they’d connected with via a town Facebook page before traveling over.\n“I was cooking dinner out of our Airbnb two or three times a week for my Portuguese friends,” says Wilson, before adding that they were warmly received by the locals, who seemed intrigued by them.\n“People never pegged us as Americans,” says Wilson. “I think they can’t peg us at all. We seldom get guessed as Americans, and we’re fine with that.”\nAs the couple began to settle into their new lives, Wilson, who describes herself as an “over-achiever,” struggled with having so much time on her hands.\n“Retirement’s been hard for me,” she admits. “Because I’m a ‘Type A’ person. My entire life has been work, work, work. I have a list and I live by the list.\n“And now it’s like, I don’t even know what day of the week it is. And that’s been a struggle.\n“But I’m in the right place for that. Because that’s kind of OK here. No one looks down at me because I’m not racing all over the world and achieving, achieving and achieving.”\nWilson and Bjork are both currently taking Portuguese language classes provided by the government. However, Wilson admits that she hasn’t found learning a new language easy.\n“Portuguese, the language is very hard,” says Wilson, explaining that she speaks Japanese and Spanish as well as “tourist German, Danish and French.”\n“I’m really good at languages. But Portuguese is a challenge to learn.\n“We don’t find it easy. We find it manageable. Some people, especially people our age, don’t find it manageable.”\nThe couple have also had to change the way that they approach people, particularly while asking for things at shops, after noticing that their direct manner wasn’t being received well.\n“My Portuguese friends taught me that you have to first recognize their humanity,” says Wilson.\nRelated article\nHow falling for a stranger she met on a beach led this woman to ditch the US for the French Riviera\n“And you do this by saying, ‘Good morning. How are you?’ And they say, ‘I’m well. Are you well?’ And once you’ve done that, it’s like a magic key that will open good service up to you.”\nWilson goes on to explain that she finds this attitude refreshing, as the focus is firmly on people and personal relationships.\n“Their ethic is not job first, or money first,” she adds. “Their ethic is family and leisure…\n“So that’s refreshing, to see people valuing relationships above the rat race. The rat died here. There’s no place for that.”\nWilson has warmly embraced the Portuguese way of life, particularly the focus on food, which has long been a big part of her life.\n“The people eat together all the time,” she says. “Sunday is considered family day. So there’s a big family meal at everybody’s mom or dad’s house and everybody gathers together and eats.\n“Portuguese women my age are always cooking. I’ve spent a lot of time with them learning Portuguese food.”\nWhile Wilson and Bjork had originally planned to use Portugal as a “jumping off point” to travel around the rest of Europe, they’ve been too busy dealing with all of the tasks that come with relocating to a new country to venture very far.\n“There’s a lot to it,” says Wilson. “From governmental stuff, getting your residency card. Then you have to transfer your driver’s license and find a car [if you drive].\n“You have to buy everything [for your house]. And you have to set up yourself with medical and utilities. Really, it’s a huge process.”\nWhen asked if she and her husband have found Portugal to be more affordable, Wilson points out that this is all relative to their own experiences, noting their Portuguese friends “push back a little” if they comment on how much cheaper things are, as it’s not necessarily cheap for them.\n“We made that mistake,” she admits. “When we first came, we were like, ‘Oh it’s practically free.’ And we had to quit doing that, because it was offending them [their friends].”\nShe points out that what seems very affordable to them, may not be to affordable to a Portuguese worker earning minimum wage.\n“A lot of people make minimum wage,” she adds. “So that being said… Yes. For Americans, it is cheaper to live here, if you don’t live in Lisbon, Porto or the Algarve.\n“Those places are like trying to live in San Francisco or Manhattan. Those are expensive cities.\n“So if you have your heart set on living in one of those places, you’re going to pay three times what we pay, probably. In rent, food, everything.”\nDuring their time in Portugal, the pair have adopted two rescue cats, grandly named Rainha Doce Florabela de Portugal and Rainha Joia Fofa Maria da Silva, through nonprofit organization The Kitten Connection.\nWilson will be making snacks for an upcoming fundraising event for the organization and has also been giving regular cooking lessons to a local teenager.\n“He loves Asian food and it’s not that easy to get here in Marinha Grande,” she explains. “So we got the idea of him learning from me.”\nShe and her husband regularly host dinner parties, including an annual Thanksgiving celebration, and attend local events, such as children’s concerts and sports games.\nBeing a part of such a close-knit community has been a dream come true for Wilson, who says that they nearly always bump into someone they know while out and about.\n“We have been here for over two years and grow happier every day with our decision,” adds Wilson.\n“We have a wealth of Portuguese friends who have helped us every step of the way and opened the doors to their homes and hearts to us.”\nWilson had become incredibly jaded by the political climate in the US before relocating, and was particularly concerned about gun violence.\n“I tell people, ‘We fled the country,” she says. “The way everything was heading… We felt outraged and enraged every minute of the day.”\nShe hasn’t been back for a visit since moving to Portugal and says she has no plans to ever return.\n“I will return to the US in an urn. Period,” she stresses. “There’s literally nothing that would compel me to return to the US.”\nWhile Wilson misses her family and friends, she says that she’s an adventurer at heart and never intended to spend the rest of her days in America.\nRelated article\nWhy this American woman has ditched the US for Portugal\n“Some people asked how I could leave my children or what my children think about it.” she says, stressing that her children are grown ups living their own lives.\n“And I have traveled my whole life on my own, leaving my children and my husband to travel for two weeks a year, every year. Just because it was that important to me.\n“And I’m a little bit of a bohemian type of person. So my kids expected nothing less than [me] going out this way. Doing something odd.”\nWilson and Bjork say that they’ve had “zero problems” since relocating to Portugal and couldn’t be happier.\nIn fact, things have gone so well that others are sometimes skeptical when they recount their experiences.\n“People are like, ‘You just see everything through rose-colored glasses.’ But everything is as perfect as I say,” says Wilson.\n“It has unfolded without any problems for us. It doesn’t happen that way for everyone – I know that. But I’m going to celebrate what we got. And we got a great experience.”\n",

        "content": "The first four months of 2024 have proven some of the most difficult in Ukraine's two years of full-scale war with Russia, and perhaps the most straining in a decade-long conflict with Moscow that erupted in 2014.\nKyiv's troops are on the back foot all along the front line, facing a reconstituted Russian military supported by an economy shifted onto a war footing with massive Chinese assistance. Ukraine's Western backers have been slow to provide weapons and hesitant to take the wider fight to Russia. Distracted and divided by a slew of elections, Ukraine's Western bloc is creaking.\nThis year is expected to be hard for Ukraine following its disappointing 2023 offensive, on which so much hope and so many resources were staked.\nKusti Salm, the permanent secretary at the Estonian Defense Ministry, told Newsweek \"2024 will be difficult\" in a December interview.\n\"They need to assume the defensive; they need to grind it out,\" he said of Ukrainian forces.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin's apparent plan to outlast his adversaries may be working. Or this year might yet prove to be Ukraine's dark night before the dawn.\nDuring a recent visit to Ukraine, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg urged allies to fulfill their military aid commitments to Kyiv and declared: \"It's not too late for Ukraine to prevail.\"\nRussia's grinding westward push is continuing all along the eastern front, with Moscow's troops straining at great cost to seize new territory in the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia regions. The total capture of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts has been a key Kremlin goal since it fomented rebellion in eastern Ukraine in 2014, and a decade on the ambition appears in reach.\nThe current plodding offensive is laying the groundwork for an expected fresh summer campaign. Among the potential targets of the new push are the Donetsk city of Chasiv Yar—which is already on the front line and may even fall before summer—and the Kharkiv city of Kupiansk, a vital gateway to Ukraine's second city of Kharkiv.\nThe Institute for the Study of War wrote this week that Russia's capture and stabilization of a salient northwest of Avdiivka \"presents the Russian command with a choice of either continuing to push west towards its reported operational objective in Pokrovsk or trying to drive northward to conduct possible complementary offensive operations with the Russian effort around Chasiv Yar.\"\nNewsweek has contacted the Russian Defense Ministry by email to request comment.\nChasiv Yar is only six miles east of Bakhmut, which has long been a hotspot on the Donetsk front, even after its fall to Russian forces in May 2023. Now abandoned by almost all of its prewar residents, the city was a vital staging point for Ukrainian forces and sits on a hill with commanding views over the surrounding area.\nIt is also a gateway to the cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, both strategic level objectives for Moscow's forces in their bid to capture all of the Donetsk region.\nKyiv focused significant resources in Chasiv Yar after Moscow fomented rebellion in the Donbas in 2014, making it home to an important military hospital and later the headquarters for the Joint Forces Operation against Russia and its local proxies.\nPokrovsk is around 26 miles northwest of Avdiivka at the junction of two major roads heading to the city of Donetsk and to Bakhmut, as well as a railway heading through Avdiivka. A successful drive all the way to Pokrovsk would expose the southern flanks of Chasiv Yar, Kramatorsk and Slovyansk.\nPavel Luzin, a Russian military analyst and visiting scholar at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, told Newsweek it is \"hard to say\" whether Moscow's forces will be able to scale up their current drive for a larger summer push.\n\"There are not too many resources for a bigger offensive,\" Luzin said. \"Also, almost all these expectations are inspired by Moscow itself.\n\"What we do see is that Russia was trying to surround a significant group of the Ukrainian forces in Avdiivka, exactly like in Ilovaisk in August 2014 and in Debaltsevo in February 2015, but was incapable of doing this. Perhaps, Russia will make another attempt in the same way, because it needs stronger positions in order to get a break in the war.\"\nThis break, Luzin added, would allow the Kremlin to rest and reinforce its mauled forces. Leaders in Kyiv have repeatedly warned that Moscow is only interested in a temporary ceasefire to this end, not in a lasting peace. Luzin concurred.\n\"They need a break, but they are not going to end the war,\" he said.\nPutin may hope to win space for a pause having won all of Donetsk and Luhansk, long at the center of his project to dismantle Ukrainian sovereignty.\n\"For today, they want to get at least Donetsk and Luhansk,\" Luzin said. \"The problem is that the Kremlin claims Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions as Russia territory as well.\"\nWhile Ukraine digs in, Kyiv will also be looking to disrupt Russian communications, logistics, and industry as much as possible. Long-range drone strikes on targets inside Russia have become commonplace, and Ukraine shows little sign of easing its attacks even in the face of American displeasure.\nThe arrival of the longest-range iteration of the American ATACMS—the MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System—will give Kyiv greater reach than ever before. The longest-range munition can hit targets out to 186 miles, almost double that of shorter range ATACMS munition first provided in late 2023. Among its possible targets is the logistically arterial and symbolically powerful Kerch Strait Bridge.\nBut as with all new weapons, Kyiv has a closing window in which to exploit the ATACMS.\n\"As we know, the Russians are able to adapt in a very short period of time,\" Ivan Stupak, a former officer in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and now an adviser to the Ukrainian parliament's national security, defense and intelligence committee, told Newsweek.\n\"I think we have up to two months to eliminate as many Russian war objects as is possible before the Russians will adapt,\" Stupak added.\nThis year may see a significant shift in air power, with Ukraine awaiting the delivery of dozens of American-made F-16 fighter jets. Kyiv has said the aircraft will boost its defense against cruise missiles and drones being launched at cities nationwide, and also give much needed relief for front line troops being bombarded by Russian airstrikes.\nMoscow's glide bombs have been pivotal in the first part of 2024, allowing its aircraft to drop massive munitions on Ukrainian positions from a relatively safe distance. F-16s will make front line areas more dangerous for Russian pilots, given Ukraine expects to be using air-to-air missiles with ranges of up to 310 miles.\nWhile Ukraine has been waiting for F-16s, Russia has been losing planes. Recent months have seen an uptick in reported Russian aircraft being downed, including far behind the front line. Those losses—and the subsequent added strain placed on surviving planes—may prove challenging for the Russian air force in the aerial battles to come.\nStill, leaders in Kyiv and some allies abroad have repeatedly warned that a drip-fed and small force of F-16s will do little to change the overall picture. It remains to be seen if Western powers can master the logistical and political challenges to deliver a large number of the jets in a manner that can give Ukraine a battlefield edge.\nBut the newly arriving aircraft will help bolster a Ukrainian air force whittled down by two years of war. Kyiv's pilots survived Russia's initial onslaught despite the vast numerical superiority of the invaders. Ukrainian airmen performed far beyond expectations, inflicting serious losses on their Russian counterparts and making large areas of Ukraine too dangerous for Moscow's aircraft.\nThe naval asymmetric cat-and-mouse game will likely continue. Kyiv's drones and cruise missiles have proven deeply problematic for the Black Sea Fleet. The force has adapted its tactics and defenses to some degree, but new iterations of Ukrainian long-range weapons will continue to pose a potent littoral threat.\nThat threat has already forced Moscow to withdraw its most high-value naval assets from occupied Crimea, the traditional home of the Black Sea Fleet and the nexus of power projection in the region and into the Mediterranean Sea. Kyiv is constantly developing its naval drones and is expected to continue strike efforts even deep into Russian waters.\nUkraine has no significant conventional navy of its own, though leaders in Kyiv have long been working with Western partners to secure new vessels, including armored riverine boats from the U.S.\nThese small ships will not be able to challenge the Black Sea Fleet, a job which will remain assigned to the asymmetric drone fleet that has proven so successful. Ukraine will spend the rest of 2024 hoping to twist the knife and exacerbate Russia's problems at sea.\n",

        "content": "Senator Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican, was confronted on Sunday morning about discussions he may have had this weekend with Donald Trump about the possibility of being the former president's running mate in this year's election.\nKristen Welker, host of NBC News' Meet the Press, pressed Scott several times about Saturday's donor event at Mar-a-Lago, which was expected to attract more than 400 donors and featured several of Trump's rumored vice-presidential picks.\n\"Did you discuss with the former president the possibility of being his running mate?\" Welker asked the senator on Sunday.\nScott, a Trump ally, then responded, \"No ma'am. What we talked this weekend about how bad the economy is for single parents like the one that raised me. We had a lot of conversations around the room about the importance of eliminating 'Bidenomics' and getting inflation back under 2 percent...We had no conversations about the VP pick to be honest with you, to be clear.\"\nAs Scott continued to talk about economic issues, Welker pressed the senator, twice, asking, \"Just to be very clear, it didn't come up at all? Do you think you're on the short list?\"\n\"I hope that the president will choose a person [as vice president] who helps the country unite and heal,\" Scott smiled as he replied. \"I certainly expect to have a decision from the president in the next 60 days or so. He didn't bring it up and I certainly didn't bring it up.\"\nThe senator added: \"I'm just excited that in this nation, a poor kid from South Carolina can rise to the level of being a United States senator. It just tells me that all things are possible for kids growing up in poverty today. Kids growing up today, listen to this show and know, all things are possible in your future.\"\nNewsweek reached out to the Trump campaign Sunday morning for comment. This story will be updated with any provided statements.\nAccording to a copy of this weekend's Republican National Committee (RNC) spring finance retreat program viewed by Reuters, Scott was joined by several other rumored vice-presidential picks.\nNorth Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and J.D. Vance of Ohio, and Representative Elise Stefanik of New York were all expected to attend the private event.\nNoem, however, has seen her chances of becoming Trump's running mate fall dramatically after reports of her shooting her \"untrainable\" dog emerged, according to an online prediction market.\nMost of this weekend's event was held at the Four Seasons hotel in Palm Beach while Trump hosted a fundraising lunch at his Mar-a-Lago estate on Saturday.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, was also scheduled to address the guests at Mar-a-Lago.\nThe donor event was also intended to help the Trump campaign shore up its finances.\nThe presumptive Republican 2024 presidential nominee is facing multiple legal challenges, including his high-profile hush money case involving adult film star Stormy Daniels. Trump has pleaded not guilty to charges that he attempted to influence the 2016 presidential election by reimbursing his lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen for payments to silence Daniels over an alleged 2006 affair she had with Trump. The former president has denied the affair ever took place.\nWith the trial in the case set to last around six weeks, the former president is racking up significant legal fees. He is also facing three other indictments and related trials that could take place this year, and has maintained his innocence in those cases as well.\nThe former president has been paying his lawyers using the Save America political action committee (PAC), which has spent more than $62 million on legal fees since January 2023, Bloomberg noted.\nTrump's campaign and the RNC said on Saturday in a statement that they raised more than $76 million in April, with over half of the contributions coming from small donors. Meanwhile, the former president's campaign and the RNC said early last month that it raised $65.6 million for March.\n",

Video from local news stations showed police in riot gear lined up on the campus on Saturday after protesters began erecting tents on Friday.\nOfficers in headgear and carrying shields began to clear the clear the encampment on Saturday afternoon. Videos on social media showed protesters were pushed to the ground, dragged by their arms and sprayed with chemical irritants.\nA spokesperson for the Virginia State Police told Newsweek that pepper spray was \"the only chemical aerosol\" deployed against protesters.\nUniversity President Jim Ryan said in a message to the school community that when Tim Longo, the chief of the university police department, approached the students \"reminding them once again of their university policy violations and pleading for a peaceful resolution,\" the request was ignored. Ryan said the university has a \"long-standing prohibition on erecting tents absent a permit.\"\nRyan said that \"when UPD's attempts to resolve the situation were met with physical confrontation and attempted assault, it became necessary to rely on assistance from the Virginia State Police.\"\nPolice \"declared an unlawful assembly, issued no-trespass orders to those who refused to disperse, and arrested those who continued to refuse dispersal,\" he added.\nRyan said he recognized that some would disagree with the decision to call in police, adding that the \"entire episode was upsetting, frightening and sad\" and \"an aberration.\"\nThe student protesters said that police had responded violently to a peaceful protest.\nOfficers \"brought these weapons to a peaceful encampment,\" the UVA Encampment for Gaza account wrote on X, formerly Twitter, alongside a photo of an officer carrying an assault-type rifle. \"They beat us. They maced us. They brutalized us.\"\nStudents for Justice in Palestine at the University of Virginia shared a video on Instagram showing state police pointing guns at protesters, noting that it came on the anniversary of the Kent State massacre—when the Ohio National Guard opened fire on unarmed college students during an anti-war protest at Kent State University in 1970, killing four and injuring nine.\nThey wrote that white nationalists and neo-Nazis who had marched on the university's campus in 2017 were not met with a similar police response.\n\"Dozens of riot police were deployed to a small Gaza solidarity encampment,\" the post's caption said. \"In 2017, hundreds of neo-Nazis and antisemites descended on UVA campus in a deadly convergence entitled 'Unite the Right,' where Heather Heyer was murdered. The fascists' only opponents were militant antifascists. Now, UVA admin is unleashing riot police on peaceful anti-genocide protesters.\"\nHeyer was killed and 19 others were injured when a car plowed into counter-protesters who had taken to the streets to decry the white nationalist rally.\nNewsweek has contacted UVA and Virginia State Police for comment via email.\nOthers also took to social media to condemn police for treating student protesters more harshly than those involved in the 2017 rally.\n\"Happening at UVA in Charlottesville, police in riot gear are moving in to arrest protesters,\" Alejandra Caraballo, a clinical instructor at the Harvard Law School's Cyberlaw Clinic, wrote on X alongside a video showing officers dragging a person away from the encampment. \"Remember when neo-Nazis openly chanted 'Jews will not replace us' and the police did nothing?\"\nJoshua P. Hill wrote: \"Seeing the outpouring of cops in Charlottesville when UVA students protest genocide vs. the absence of (uniformed) cops when Nazis rallied in Charlottesville for Unite the Right makes things very clear. This is who cops are.

        "content": "A new poll spells potential trouble for former President Donald Trump as he stands trial in Manhattan in his criminal hush money case.\nTrump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, became the first former president in U.S. history to stand trial in a criminal case last month. Following an investigation by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office, Trump was indicted in March 2023 on 34 charges of allegedly falsifying business records relating to hush money payments that were made to adult film star Stormy Daniels during his 2016 presidential campaign. Daniels alleges she had an affair with Trump in 2006, which he has denied. The former president has pleaded not guilty to all charges and said the case against him is politically motivated.\nDespite Trump's legal troubles, which include three other criminal indictments—all of which he has pleaded not guilty to—it remains a tight race in the polls between the former president and his likely challenger in November, President Joe Biden, the Democratic incumbent.\nHowever, this can change if Trump is convicted. According to an ABC News/Ipsos poll produced by Langer Research Associates and conducted between April 25 to 30 that was published on Sunday, 80 percent of Trump's supporters said they will continue to stand by him if he was convicted of a felony in the hush money case. Meanwhile, 20 percent of his base would either reconsider their support (16 percent) or withdraw their support of Trump (4 percent).\nThe sample size of the subgroup of Trump supporters was 937 adults with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4. The national sample size of the poll was 2,260 adults and the margin of error for the full sample was 2 percentage points. Of the national sample size, 31 percent were Democrats, 29 percent were Republicans and 28 percent were independents.\nNewsweek reached out to Trump's and Biden's campaigns as well as political experts via email for comment.\nMeanwhile, results varied in a matchup between Trump and Biden, depending on how adults in the poll identified.\nJust looking at all adults surveyed, excluding people who said they wouldn't vote, 46 percent supported Trump while 44 percent supported Biden. However, Biden led Trump among registered and likely voters. A total of 46 percent of registered voters supported Biden while 45 percent supported Trump. Meanwhile, 49 percent of likely voters supported Biden while 45 percent supported Trump.\nWhile it is still unclear how much damage a felony conviction in any of the four criminal indictments can have on Trump's campaign, a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted from February 9 to 12 found that 55 percent of American adults would not vote for Trump if he was convicted of a felony. That number is 51 percent among Republicans.\nThe full sample size of that poll was 1,237 people, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.91. The sample size of Republicans was 502, with a margin of error of plus or minus 5.26 percentage points.\n",

        "content": "In April, the Biden Administration released new Title IX regulations scheduled to take effect in time for the upcoming 2024-2025 school year. Title IX is an over 50-year-old federal civil rights statute responsible for ensuring gender equality within educational settings that receive federal funding. Among other things, Title IX protects students against hostile environments, such as those arising out of campus-based sexual misconduct and anti-LGBTQ bias.\nSince 1974, the U.S. Department of Education has enforced Title IX regulations requiring federally funded educational institutions to provide \"prompt and equitable\" grievance proceedings to address complaints of sex discrimination, including those of sexual harassment and violence. These regulations originally lacked specificity, requiring the Department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) to issue guidance on what an appropriate grievance process should entail at the campus level.\nIn 2011 and 2014, among other things, President Barack Obama issued Title IX guidance requiring schools to specifically address campus sexual assaults rather than deferring these matters solely to law enforcement, and to do so within 60 days whenever possible. However, this guidance-based approach changed in 2017, when the Trump administration rescinded existing Title IX guidance to then amend the Title IX regulations for the first time in 2020.\nAs indicated in the Federal Register's regulatory comments, the Biden administration found Trump-era Title IX regulations were \"overly prescriptive\" regarding certain aspects of campus-based grievance proceedings. The Trump administration had done so intentionally to protect those accused of misconduct over those who were victimized by it. As examples, it heightened standards for issuing interim suspensions and finding sexual harassment charges, while imposing mandatory dismissals for off-campus sexual misconduct incidents and requiring live cross-examination during certain Title IX hearings.\nIt also removed any standard for the promptness requirement to leave schools without any guidance. These regulatory changes not only deterred students from making formal complaints, but also emboldened institutions to prolong grievance proceedings to exhaust and further deter students from accessing the Title IX process.\nAdvocates were frustrated with the Biden administration's year-long delay in issuing the new Title IX regulations, which have finally arrived to better protect students and are now facing legal scrutiny. While the Biden-era regulations balance due process for those accused of misconduct with the need to eradicate sex and gender-based discrimination, harassment, and violence within education, several Republican-led states have already filed lawsuits challenging the regulatory protections for LGBTQ students.\nThe outcome of these lawsuits will either help fuel or quell the ongoing \"culture wars\" within K-12 schools regarding the ability of minor students to freely express their chosen gender identity (as opposed to conforming to their assigned biological sex). On the horizon, the Biden administration will release more Title IX regulations addressing trans-athletes, which is a topic of ongoing controversy amongst policymakers.\nFor survivors of campus sexual misconduct, the new Title IX regulations undo some of the damage of the Trump-era rules by (1) ensuring former students and employees may file Title IX complaints when the accused is still at the educational institution, and allow such complaints to be made orally not just in writing, 34 C.F.R. § 106.2; (2) strongly endorsing the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard for adjudications unless the educational institution uses the heightened \"clear and convincing\" standard for all comparable misconduct proceedings, 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(h); (3) reminding institutions to issue sanctions for misconduct as well as remedies to the victim and other affected students to address resulting hostile environments on campus, 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(h)(3); and (4) clarifying that retaliation is another form of prohibited discrimination under Title IX to ensure the same procedures are followed by schools for such reports, 34 C.F.R. § 106.71. By undoing some of the barriers to justice established by the Trump-era rules, the new Title IX regulations rebalance Title IX to better advance victim protections and eliminate abuse.\nThe 2024 Title IX regulations are not likely to change the ongoing legal battles surrounding campus sexual misconduct or LGBTQ rights, but they will certainly help students equally access education in the interim, as our nation keeps working toward safer learning environments for all. The real question now is around how OCR will enforce the new regulations given the high volume of pending Title IX complaints under the Trump-era regulations and limited funding by Congress for such efforts. For those invested in safer schools, our next steps must be to call congressmembers to demand increased funding for Title IX enforcement to continue ensuring ongoing gender equality with federally funded educational settings into the future.\nLaura L.

        "content": "Title IX has helped make the United States home to some of the highest educated, most athletically dominant women on the planet. But that won't stop the Biden administration from destroying Title IX to appease the most radical members of its party.\nBefore the Biden administration announced its new rule, Title IX had one purpose: to ensure women and girls have equal access to publicly funded educational opportunities. It didn't matter if that education took place in an elementary classroom or an NCAA basketball court; the purpose of Title IX was to protect opportunities for women and girls to learn and grow in a safe environment.\nThe Biden administration, however, appears to think women have had enough success.\nUnder its new rule, President Biden's Department of Education has abandoned accepted ideas of sex and gender to single-handedly interpret Title IX as protecting students from discrimination based on \"gender identity.\" Schools must now allow students to participate in any \"activity consistent with their gender identity,\" as asserted by the students themselves, or risk facing a discrimination lawsuit.\nThis will open up schools to lawsuits if they forbid biological boys from using girls' restrooms or locker rooms. The same will be true for schools that ban biological boys from the girls' health or physical education classes.\nPut differently, Title IX will no longer protect women based on their immutable physical characteristics. Instead, activists can weaponize Title IX to force schools to prioritize the comfortable education of the boy with gender dysphoria above the academic and emotional well-being of the dozens of girls who would rather not share a locker room or learn about puberty alongside biological boys.\nPresident Biden's new rule defeats the purpose of Title IX. By interpreting Title IX to be about protecting \"gender identity\" instead of physical gender, President Biden will place countless women and girls in uncomfortable—or even unsafe—learning environments.\nThe Biden administration is unperturbed. It dismissed the concerns of parents who don't want their daughters to share a bathroom with a biological man by denying that the \"mere presence of a transgender person in a single-sex space compromises anyone's legitimate privacy interest.\"\nPut down the bong.\nIt may be President Biden's belief that little girls do not have a legitimate privacy interest in only sharing restrooms with other women and girls, but common sense and most Americans disagree.\nThe Biden administration's Title IX rule will also require language restrictions, mandated by the federal government, on any teacher who wishes to use grammatically correct pronouns. Under the new rule, any teacher who refers to a little boy as \"he\" instead of \"they\" in a way that the federal government finds objectively offensive will trigger a lawsuit for discrimination. Grammar teachers might as well cancel the lesson on pronouns now.\nI have empathy for the small percentage of young people who suffer from gender dysphoria. Those students deserve to receive a quality education, too. We cannot, however, prioritize the comfort of a small set of gender dysphoric students over the safety, education and opportunities of all women and girls.\nTitle IX has protected women and girls for more than 50 years. President Biden ought to hide his head in a bag if he allows his administration to destroy decades of progress for women by turning Title IX into a weapon that his party can use to tear apart schools that don't support these anti-women gender policies.\nJohn Kennedy is a U.S. Senator from Louisiana.\nThe views expressed in this article are the writer's own.\n",

Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nNewsweek has reached out to the Pentagon via email for additional information.\nUkraine debuted its ATACMS in October 2023 using a cluster variant of the missiles to strike two Russian military bases in Ukraine and damage a slew of helicopters.\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan said last month that President Joe Biden had secretly authorized a \"significant number of ATACMS missiles\" to Ukraine in February.\nReuters reported on Saturday that a U.S. official said Washington had quietly sent longer-range versions of ATACMS to Ukraine, which were used to strike Russian-controlled Crimea in mid-April. It was reported in mid-February that the U.S. favored sending longer-range ATACMS to Kyiv to enable strikes on the Russian-held Crimean peninsula. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine back in 2014.\nThey were part of a $300 million aid package announced in mid-March and they have already arrived in Ukraine for use within the country's borders, Sullivan said. \"We've already sent some, we will send more now that we have additional authority and money,\" he added.\nThe U.S. did not publicly announce the delivery of ATACMS because of a Ukrainian request for \"operational security,\" U.S. State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel said during a press briefing last month.\n\"Until recently, as we've said on many occasions, we were unable to provide these ATACMS because of readiness concerns,\" Sullivan told the media on April 24.\nThe Biden administration had been working \"behind the scenes\" to alleviate these concerns, Sullivan told reporters, adding: \"We now have a significant number of ATACMS coming off the production line and entering U.S. stocks.\"\nATACMS give Kyiv's troops the firepower to strike high-value Russian assets far behind the frontlines.

Last month, the head of the U.S.' European Command, General Christopher Cavoli, told U.S. lawmakers that Russia had lost around 10 percent of its aircraft fleet in the full-scale war which is in its third year.\nKyiv's air force is expected to have Western-provided F-16 fighter jets in the coming weeks, many months after the jets were originally pledged by a handful of Ukraine's backers. The jets, although not a gamechanger in small numbers, will help replenish aircraft losses with more advanced hardware.\nUkrainian air force spokesperson Illya Yevlash said the country's ground forces had targeted the Russian Su-25 jet. \"We see excellent work, including the work of small- and medium-range air-defense units that can effectively deal with various types of air targets, including aircraft,\" Yevlash said, according to Ukrainian media.\n\"I want to thank each warrior in our mobile firing groups, in the air force, in air-defense units of other types and branches of the military forces—all those who are protecting now and will continue to protect the Ukrainian skies from Russian terror,\" Zelensky added. \"It is important to be as attentive as possible these days.\"\nNewsweek has reached out to the Russian Defense Ministry for comment via email.\nAir defenses have long been a priority for Ukraine, key for fending off persistent attacks from Russia's larger and more advanced air force. Zelensky said on Saturday that Russia had fired eight missiles and \"almost 70\" guided aerial bombs along the border and the front line.\nIn recent weeks, Russian jets have launched guided aerial bombs from outside the reach of Ukraine's air defenses. Moscow has used modified Soviet-era \"dumb\" munitions, converted into precision-guided winged bombs, to devastate Kyiv's positions.\nUkraine has consistently lobbied for more Western-made air-defense systems, and the missiles to keep them firing, in the face of near-constant strikes. A recently-committed tranche of military aid from the U.S., that had spent months languishing in Congress, focused on Kyiv's air-defense needs, as well as refilling artillery ammunition stocks.\n",

Using this method, Russia's gains have been incremental but its forces have built on momentum following the capture of Avdiivka in the Donetsk oblast, albeit at a huge cost.\nAccording to Ukraine's latest figures released on Saturday, Russian forces suffered losses of more than 1,000 for the seventh day in a row, with the 1,260 casualties of both killed and wounded taking the war's total to 473,400.\nWhile an accurate count of Russian personnel losses is tricky to calculate, it is not far off the 465,000 estimate given on Saturday by the U.K. Ministry of Defense (MOD) which said casualties will increase again in May and June amid renewed offensive operations in the east of Ukraine. This follows \"a slight decrease in the pace of operations\" over the last two months, it added.\n\"It is likely that despite the extreme cost in life, Russia has fully adapted its military to attritional warfare which relies on mass over quality,\" the British officials said.\n\"This reliance on mass will almost certainly continue for the duration of the Ukraine war and have long-lasting effects on Russia's future army.\"\nNewsweek has contacted the Russian defense ministry for comment on the latest British daily assessment which tends to highlight Moscow's losses and Ukraine's gains.\nUkraine and the U.K.'s estimates of Russian casualties roughly chime with those given by France, whose foreign minister Stéphane Séjourne told independent outlet Novaya Gazyeta had reached 500,000, 150,000 of whom had been killed.\nRussia has not given any update to its tally of losses since it said in September 2022 that just under 6,000 troops had been killed.\nUkraine has not given an update of its losses since President Volodymyr Zelensky said in February that 31,000 of his troops had been killed. However, Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu said on Friday that Kyiv's troop losses had surpassed 111,000.\nMeanwhile, independent outlet Mediazona has been working with BBC News Russian service to compile the number of deaths of Russia's soldiers, drawing on publicly available information such as obituaries and online notices. Their latest figures revealed on April 26 that at least 51,679 Russian troops had been killed, although they emphasize the actual number of deaths was likely a lot higher.\n",

There were no fatalities, he said, adding that 30 homes and 10 cars were damaged, without offering any further information about the source of the blast.\nNewsweek has reached out to the Russian Defense Ministry for comment via email.\nRussian glide-bombs have rained down on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, in recent months. Across the front line, Moscow has used adapted Soviet-era bombs, fitting the munitions with guidance kits and wings, to strike targets.\nRussian jets fire the precision-guided bombs out of the range of Kyiv's air defenses, and they glide towards their target, often with devastating effect. Ukrainian officials in Kharkiv have reported several strikes, including those using guided aerial bombs, in recent days.\nLast month, footage appeared to show a 1,500-kilogram (3,300-pound) converted bomb landing on a Russian-controlled village in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, although the munition did not detonate. Separately in April, Russian independent media outlet Astra reported that Moscow had mistakenly dropped a Kh-59 missile on a village in the Belgorod region.\nIn January, Russia bombed the village of Petropavlovka, in the country's Voronezh region, by mistake. The defense ministry said at the time that there had been an \"abnormal discharge of aircraft ammunition\" over the village, state media reported. A few days later, a Moscow-installed official said one of its jets had accidentally dropped a FAB-250 bomb on Rubizhne, in Ukraine's annexed Luhansk region.\nIn April 2023, a Russian warplane accidentally bombed Belgorod, causing a huge crater and a large explosion in the city.\n",

In 2022, he signed up as an \"ambassador\" for Ukraine's United24 fundraising platform to bolster the country's \"Army of Drones\" program, while taking the opportunity to refer to Russia as the \"evil empire.\"\nPrior to the 2020 presidential election, Hamill compared Biden to Luke Skywalker, saying that \"the force is strong\" with the then-future president as he shared images of Biden spliced into Star Wars on X, then Twitter.\nFormer Trump campaign adviser Brad Parscale seemingly embraced the idea that Trump was part of the \"empire\" by comparing the Trump campaign to a Death Star, the gigantic weapon of mass destruction that appears in multiple Star Wars films.\nHamill has continued to regularly share pro-Biden and anti-Trump messages on X. This week, he has posted a series of political messages that appear to be in preparation for May 4—a special occasion for Star Wars fans who celebrate it as \"May the Fourth\" due to a resemblance to the film quote \"may the force be with you.\"\n\"May The First Not Quench Your Thirst For Biden's Re-election! #BidenHarris2024,\" Hamill posted on Wednesday.\n\"May The Second Biden Administration Be As Productive and Successful As The 1st,\" he continued on Thursday.\n\"May The Third Be Absurd That The Guy Who Tried To Steal A Fair Election Is Allowed To Run Again,\" reads Hamill's most recent post on Friday.\n",

        "content": "Melanie Lynskey has revealed her biggest \"challenge\" while filming Peacock's new historical drama The Tattooist of Auschwitz.\nThe Critics' Choice Award winner is known for playing complex female characters, such as Shauna in psychological horror Yellowjackets, or revolutionary leader Kathleen in zombie drama The Last of Us.\nHowever, Lynskey has taken on a tamer, but no less stimulating role in The Tattooist of Auschwitz. The 46 year old stars as Heather Morris, the author behind the book the six-episode series is based on.\n\"In a way, it's a relief to not be fighting zombies or eating anyone,\" Lynskey told Newsweek, referencing her recent TV roles. \"But you know it was hard in its own ways. It is its own kind of challenge.\"\nLynskey finds it \"fun\" to play complicated women, but the Emmy nominee said portraying a real person came with \"a lot of responsibility.\"\n\"I just [wanted] her to be happy,\" Lynskey said. \"I [wanted] her to feel represented, and feel like she was seeing herself without [me] doing an impersonation of her, which would be so weird.\"\nRead more: Best Affordable Streaming Services\nAlthough she described the process as a \"balancing act,\" Lynskey discovered she could relate to Morris's sudden success in midlife.\nThe Tattooist of Auschwitz was Morris's debut novel, based on her real-life conversations with Holocaust survivor Ludwig (Lale) Sokolov—portrayed by Oscar nominee Harvey Keitel and The Little Mermaid actor Jonah Hauer-King in the show.\nWhile tasked with tattooing identification numbers onto the arms of other prisoners, Sokolov fell in love with a woman named Gita (Anna Próchniak), with Morris documenting their years-long struggle to be together.\nThe 2018 novel became an international bestseller, with Lynskey following a similar career journey. She landed her first movie role aged 17, starring alongside Kate Winslet in Peter Jackson's 1994 drama Heavenly Creatures.\nHer performance was praised by critics, but while Winslet headed to Hollywood, Lynskey preferred low-budget indie projects. This ensured she produced work she was proud of, but meant that few people outside of the industry knew her name.\nMainstream film and TV shows often relegated Lynskey to small parts, such as Reese Witherspoon's childhood friend in Sweet Home Alabama or as Charlie Sheen's stalker neighbor Rose in the early 2000 sitcom Two and a Half Men.\nLynskey left the role after two seasons due to a fear of only being seen as the show's \"wacky neighbor,\" despite Rose being her steadiest acting job to date. At the time, her agent called her \"crazy\" for turning down a spot as a series regular.\nHowever, Yellowjackets changed the game, making Lynskey a bonafide star as well as critically acclaimed. Lynskey stars as the adult version of Shauna in the Showtime series, a Surburban mom who survived a plane crash as a teenager and spent a year-and-a-half stranded in the Canadian wilderness. Her portrayal has led to multiple awards nominations across the show's two seasons, including an Emmy, a Satellite Award and an Independent Spirit gong.\n\"There is something about having led a relatively private life and then suddenly being a lot more public,\" Lynskey said.\n\"I think Heather took to it a lot more easily than I did. I'm still quite shy and awkward. You know people sort of recognize me and I feel like I'm in trouble, but she's great with people.\"\nRead more: Earn Cash Back for Streaming Services\nThere is another benefit to playing Morris—the New Zealand native gets to use her real voice for the role.\n\"It's always nice to get to use my own accent,\" she said. \"She's from Te Awamutu, which is a town that I know. It's incredible.\"\nStream The Tattooist of Auschwitz on Peacock from May 2.\n",

Newsweek approached Kensington Palace in London via email for comment.\nImages released by Kensington Palace have faced increased scrutiny following the Mother's Day scandal. Kate issued a public apology after traces of editing were identified in a portrait of herself and her three children taken by Prince William in Windsor, Berkshire, in England.\nThe photo was of particular importance as it was the first officially released of Kate since stepping out of the public eye to undergo abdominal surgery in January. She then said that at the time of the photo backlash she had been diagnosed with cancer and was undergoing a course of preventive chemotherapy.\nSince photo agencies issued \"kill\" notices to news agencies over the Mother's Day image, William and Kate have moved away from the traditional form of releasing royal celebration portraits to agencies ahead of events. For the birthday of Prince Louis and the couple's 13th wedding anniversary in April, images were released through the Wales' social-media channels. This was followed on May 2 by the birthday portrait of Princess Charlotte.\nIn the image, the princess is shown standing in an outdoor setting, smiling broadly and wearing a raspberry cardigan with denim skirt and blue blouse combination.\nFollowing the image's release, users on X (formerly Twitter) quickly highlighted that the cardigan, identified as being sourced from French fashion brand Cyrillus, was the same one that the princess was seen wearing in the controversial Mother's Day photo.\nThis sparked a wave of posts and speculation, ranging from claims that the image had been taken on the day of the Mother's Day image, despite reports saying it had been created in the days before its release, to fans suggesting Kate was \"trolling\" her critics with the reference.\nIn addition to Charlotte's cardigan, some users also highlighted that Prince Louis appeared to be wearing the same shirt he had done in the Mother's Day photo for his own birthday portrait released a month later.\n\"They must not have gotten any new clothes this year,\" wrote one X user, posting a photo highlighting the matches.\n\"Do these Royal children only own 1 set of clothes?\" posted another. \"Louis in the same shirt as the Mother's Day photo last week. Now, Charlotte in the same cardigan and ruffled neck shirt (albeit a \"different\" color shirt) as the Mother's Day photo. WHY does this keep happening?\"\nIn response, fans of the royal jumped to her defense. \"She is trolling the trolls and I'm here for it,\" wrote on user of Kate in a post with over 70,000 views.\n\"That Mother's Day photo controversy started with Charlotte's cardigan sleeve. Now Catherine is making a point that, this picture isn't altered. She's messing with all the doubting Thomas's [people questioning her] out there,\" wrote another. This is a reference to the fact that one of the editing traces spotted in the Mother's Day image occurred around Charlotte's sleeve.\nFollowing Kate's apology—issued a day after the Mother's Day photo was released, which said \"like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing\"—neither the princess nor Kensington Palace has directly addressed the photo or the scandal surrounding it.\nJames Crawford-Smith is Newsweek's royal reporter, based in London.

In the ensuing months of war, more than 34,500 people have died in Gaza and about 80 percent of the population has been displaced, according to the latest figures from the Associated Press.\nMorgan and his guests were talking about the pro-Palestinian protests at college campuses around the United States which have led to hundreds of arrests. Morgan spoke about Jewish students at the colleges who had allegedly been harassed by the protesters.\n\"All you wanna talk about is the Jewish students,\" West told Morgan, insisting he should focus on Israel's actions in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis it has caused. \"Then, in fact, you become an extension of propaganda, and that's why I call you a racist because it means then that Palestinian lives do not have the same value as an Israeli life.\"\nMorgan snapped, \"How dare you?\" to West, refuting his accusations of racism.\n\"How dare you call me a racist. What you don't know is before I did this debate, I did a long interview with one of the IDF spokesmen in which I went after him about their planned invasion of Rafah because I think it would be a catastrophic mistake. So don't call me a racist,\" Morgan said.\nFollowing another heated exchange, Morgan said, \"I believe Palestinian lives matter just as much as any other life and I've always said that,\" to which West replied, \"Does not manifest in your framing, brother. Does not manifest in your framing.\"\nMorgan added, \"Don't throw around the word 'racist' without any evidence to support the fact that I'm a racist.\"\n\"I've been hearing the evidence,\" West told him. \"It's not throwing around. It's the reality.\"\nMorgan was formerly a host on TV breakfast show Good Morning Britain until he dramatically walked off-air during a live segment in 2021 where one of his co-presenters accused him of being racist over his views on Megan Markle.\nRead more: Earn Cash Back for Streaming Services\nHe has openly shared his views on Israel's military attacks on Gaza online.\n\"The oppression of Palestinian people has been totally unacceptable, and peace will never be possible until they are afforded freedom & equality. But it should be possible to believe that, and to condemn the horrifying terror attacks on Israel on Oct 7,\" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter, almost three weeks after Hamas' attack.\nHis coverage of the war has proved divisive, though.\n\"The person covering Palestine-Israel best is ... Piers Morgan?\" asked Aymann Ismail in a column for Slate.\n\"Morgan's approach seems simple enough: have on the program as many people from as wide an array of opinions as possible, and let them make their case to him on the air,\" wrote Ismail. \"He gives each guest a considerable amount of airtime too, some stretching beyond 30 minutes—which may not sound like a lot until you compare it to other segments on broadcast news, which rarely surpass a few minutes before moving on.\"\nIsmail continued: \"At a time when social media bubbles often exacerbate polarization and misinformation, Morgan's seemingly sincere commitment to fostering meaningful dialogue stands out.\"\nBut Mohamad Elmasry, a professor of Media Studies at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies does not agree.\n\"The British talk show host deserves credit for featuring pro-Palestinian voices, but interview successes are owed mostly to the talent of his guests refuting his Israeli talking points,\" he wrote for the Middle East Eye in November.\n\"It is probably true that he has given more space for Palestine supporters than anyone else in mainstream western media,\" Elmasry wrote, but \"Morgan has not been nearly as balanced or fair as he implies, however.\"\nElmasry argued that Morgan seemed more likely to push back on pro-Palestinian guests while giving \"softball\" questions to those who were pro-Israeli.\n",

I was flabbergasted.\nMy partner and I hadn't used birth control in years. Not because we were trying for a child, but because after years of being casual about birth control, we assumed he shot blanks. I guess the joke was on me.\nThat night, I met an old colleague, and we caught up. I was dying inside but couldn't—wouldn't—share. Not that he wouldn't have accepted me. I was just afraid. Prideful. In shock. In denial.\nI called my partner and told him. He asked how that happened. I said, \"Lack of birth control, bud.\" By this time, our union was just a shell game. Smoke and mirrors. A happy looking, successful, and beautiful couple turned into a sham.\nI recall praying. I recall crying. I recall the decision to call the clinic and make an appointment to terminate the pregnancy. I called my mom and gained her support. I distinctly remember it was my choice.\nI did not consult my partner on the topic at all. Some regrets live on, and some don't. This was one that didn't. I simply was not going to get myself into any situation that would force me to be dependent on or intertwined with him. I couldn't trust him with anything. I certainly could not depend on him to be a father, and I was not going to do it myself.\nAs I walked into the clinic in Dallas, they were holding an anti-abortion rally outside its doors. I saw them approaching the young, scared, soon-to-be mothers entering and engaging them in persuasive conversation.\nNot me. I stood tall, was dressed in business clothes, and walked through that crowd like I was going on a sales call. Confident, scared to the root of my soul, ashamed, assured my decision was accurate. I'm pretty certain none of them expected a 44-year-old client.\nOnce inside, I was at peace. The waiting room was full of such young, scared girls. Some sat with their boyfriends, others with mothers or sisters, and some alone, just like me. I realized as we sat there waiting for our names to be called that we all had such different paths and stories that had led us to the exact same point. I somehow found peace in that.\nMy name was called, and I slipped into my gown. All the nurses were so kind and gentle and soft-spoken. The furniture, beds, and clinic were threadbare and reminiscent of the 1950s. But to me, it felt like a comfortable old blanket. Like grandma's house. Not fancy, but spotless and full of love and peace. I felt comfortable, safe, and unjudged.\nThe realization of seeing the tiny heartbeat and having the nurse assure me that I was, in fact, six weeks along was surreal. I could identify the night of conception. Oddly, I recalled thinking at the time that we should have used birth control that night. I had let my guard down.\nNext, the doctor came in. He was in his sixties and looked like he was tired of fighting the daily fight to perform procedures that are firmly protected by our constitution in 2007. He asked me why I was thinking about an abortion.\nI explained that I did not have a partner who gave two cents about me, how much I loved my career, and how I could not afford to give my job up to raise this child. I told him I had three beautiful adult sons, and that I was done with the child-rearing time in my life. I told him I had based my decision on logic, knowledge, and not fear.\nWhile recuperating in this warm, dark, soft, music-playing wardroom, I felt at peace. Nestled into my blankies alone with my thoughts, I knew I had made the right decision. Six hours later, I got up, got dressed, and walked out the door into the same crowd I'd walked past seven hours earlier.\nThey now knew. I knew they knew. Again, I strode past them, head high, my eyes up, confident that I had taken control of the rights of women to own their own bodies. Even now, as I write this as a reborn Christian, I do not know if I would have made a different choice.\nThat was my path—the same path that led me to Christ and the same Christ-driven path I am on today. Judge me. Applaud me. Pray for me. Cry for me. The choice is yours—just as the choice was mine.\nI do not believe abortion is birth control to be abused, but it should be an option. I believe women take on 100 percent of the responsibility for carrying a child and 70-90 percent of the care. There are great fathers out there who break that mold, but holistically, I believe that it is the mothers who raise the babies a lot of the time.\nIt seems impossible to believe that male birth control pills have not been invented to share the responsibility, but they haven't. When we find ourselves pregnant, we must act fast and trust our instincts.\nI believe that if a woman is pregnant, she alone may choose her destiny. Roe vs. Wade was signed into place to protect women in need of medical choices. With it being revoked in a number of states, we are casting shame on women needlessly as they franticly search out council facilities to end pregnancies.\nI am not justifying murder, but I am not doomed to eternal damnation because I sought an abortion. As a Christian, I believe that all sins are heinous, and all sins can be erased with Christ's mercy. If He didn't die for all sins, then his sacrifice on the cross was futile.\nMotherhood is a destiny and an honor. I would advise women to prayerfully decide when it is their turn to be mothers and to prayerfully make their own decisions.\nJoanne Richardson is President of Gailwinds Group LLC.

        "content": "In the winter of 1969, during the frigid spring semester at the University of Minnesota, a coalition of Black students staged a sit-in protest at Morrill Hall, occupying the office of the bursar and records for almost twenty-four hours.\nLed by Afro-American Action Committee (AAAC) President Rosemary Freeman, a sophomore, and one of only eighty-seven Black students on a campus of 40,000, the organization had communicated their grievances and demands for institutional changes several times previously.\nFreeman was originally from Browning, Mississippi, an all-Black community created by a group of ex-slaves shortly after the Civil War. She first came to activism as a high school student working to register Black voters in the south under Martin Luther King Jr. She'd been previously jailed for her participation in voter registration and was therefore no stranger to contentious political situations.\nThe assassinations of Dr. King and then Robert Kennedy in 1968 intensified the AAAC's desire to call the university to action. Among other things, they wanted the institution to foster diversity on campus via scholarships for local Black high school students and the creation of an African American Studies department.\nUniversity of Minnesota President Malcolm Moos, previously radio silent in response to the committee's outreach, negotiated a common ground to end the protest by the deadline. And thanks to the action of the AAAC, an African American Studies department was created and the university opened its doors more readily to local Black talent.\nIn February 2019, the University's Department of African American and African Studies celebrated the fiftieth reunion of the protest with teach-ins at the student union, the first time for a public reckoning of the events of 1969.\nRosemary Freeman, along with John Wright, Horace Huntley, and Warren Tucker Jr., are rarely known. As the AAAC president and, as she tells it, the one who leveled the playing field between herself and President Moos by greeting him in his own office chair during negotiations, Freeman's involvement is often glossed over in the scant number of available retellings.\nWhen I started my doctoral work in the sociology department at the University of Minnesota almost exactly forty years after the Morrill Hall Takeover (as it has come to be known), I'd never heard the story, nor did I understand the legacy of Freeman's leadership.\nWhich stories get told impact who is able to feel empowered by them. The erasure of Black women's stories weakens our understanding and connection to the legacy of Black women's accomplishments and dims the possibility of our collective strength.\nFifteen years before the Morrill Hall Takeover, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), working with Black families around the country, brought local lawsuits against counties across the South after being blocked from enrolling their children, mostly Black girls, into segregated white schools, culminating in the landmark Supreme Court case that legalized educational desegregation.\nThe stories of coordinated legal action are rarely heard, silencing the voices of all those other families who sacrificed themselves for the integration fight but whose names are absent from historical narratives on the issue.\nBrown v. Board of Education has been watered down to focus on one little girl, Linda Brown, wiping away what was actually a long-term, strategic plan between the NAACP, more than a dozen families, and the students themselves. This organized erasure of complex political protests organized in Black communities maintains perceptions of our ineptness in political organizing.\nIt is not a coincidence that girls and women (often mothers and teachers) led the fight for school desegregation. Black girls learn early in life that they will be expected to be poised and strong-willed in the face of danger and degradation.\nThe girls on the front lines of desegregation were physically and psychologically attacked, ignored, or otherwise pushed to their limits at school. In response, their voices were their weapons.\nThey utilized silence when deliberately provoked and spoke up in classes where teachers ignored their signals to participate voluntarily. They endured, sure, but they also made waves.\nSo much of the work of political organizing and protest has been concentrated among Black girls, in schools. But to highlight our skills of organization and execution of activism is to magnify our strengths, so the strategy and forethought of Black activism must be repackaged as insignificant or nonexistent. I didn't know my own connections to the desegregation movement until recently, which is perhaps to say I didn't know my strength.\nThree years after the Brown v. Board of Education decision, The Little Rock Nine, nine Black students—six girls and three boys—enrolled at the all-white Little Rock Central High School just a few blocks from where my mother lived with her family in Arkansas.\nJust a toddler at the time, my mother and her siblings were often under the care of fifteen-year-old, Carlotta (Walls) LaNier, the youngest of the Little Rock Nine attempting to integrate the local high school and the first Black woman to graduate from Little Rock Central High School.\nCarlotta was my family's regular babysitter; she was also on the front lines of American desegregation. She, along with her eight classmates, withstood the racial slurs and threats of physical violence in the name of education. She also paid a heavy price.\nAfter her graduation, the Walls family was forced to relocate to Colorado to find work and avoid the backlash caused by Carlotta's participation in the equal education fight. Ms. LaNier was a woman I'd never heard directly linked to my family until recently, when I made the decision to uncover her story as a part of ours.\nHistory, as a discipline and a social construct, does not view women, especially Black women, as historical actors. Despite our accomplishments, what we do is not often chronicled as \"real\" history. This is as true at Vassar as at any other HWSCU. In 1969 and again in 1990, Black students protested on campus and occupied buildings to demand fair treatment and increased support structures for Black students.\nIn 1969, thirty-four Black women undergrads took over the main building in the early morning hours, a result of detailed tactical planning, which allowed them to take over the switchboard with relative ease. They remained for three days until then President Alan Simpson responded to their demands.\nIn February 1990, a group of Black students again staged a sit-in at the main building, this time to protest the hiring of Daniel Patrick Moynihan—a white Republican sociologist infamous for his racist theories about the status of Black communities—as a distinguished lecturer at the college.\nMoynihan quit his post as a result of the protests. Recollection of the events is captured in the Vassar Encyclopedia, but you won't hear discussions of their organization on campus or about the improvements made as a result of their efforts.\nThere aren't photos capturing their occupation of Main Hall hung alongside those pictures of almost two hundred years of white students that serve as a visual history of the place. There are no anniversary celebrations or well-kept archives of what these students were fighting against or what they achieved. Their stories are functionally lost from the general history of the college.\nBlack students continue standing on the front lines of protests against police brutality and racism on college campuses across the country. They are being jailed, threatened, and vilified but also ignored in favor of the mainstream appeal of white student activists when the topic is appropriately \"non-racial.\"\nOn college campuses, Black students are challenging their \"othered\" status in ways I never thought possible. Conservatives often perpetuate the false narrative that colleges are places where hyper-liberal professors hijack students' minds with impractical, politically correct ideals. In reality, my students, mostly Black women, come to me not initially looking to protest.\nThey want to belong, to be the proverbial Vassar girls their white counterparts are offered the chance to become. And they are frustrated that the promises of higher education don't seem to apply to them.\nWe are not so different, my students and me. Protest is a last resort, a desperate act from groups of people without access to conventional support, but also with limited information about the activism of their forbearers.\nThese Black women want an education free from all the trappings of white supremacy that limit their potential. I didn't protest when I probably should've. I didn't recognize my connections to Black women activists and disruptors of the past, but they were there to be heard. And so, I try to pass down these stories, as bits of wisdom from the ancestors, that I wish I'd had.\nThis is an adapted excerpt from Black Women, Ivory Tower: Revealing the Lies of White Supremacy in American Education (Broadleaf Books, 2024).

And since I wasn't allowed to go to college, I studied piano pedagogy textbooks on my own to learn how to be a better teacher.\nI became resourceful despite my restrictions, and that's how I eventually escaped and started my life over, as I've written about in my new book, Rift: A Memoir of Breaking Away from Christian Patriarchy.\nI thought I had left that oppressive world behind, but now, more than a decade later, I see the #tradwife trend on social media, and it's bringing everything back—the glorification of traditional gender roles that were never as shiny as they appear with photo filters and curated vintage clothing.\nScrolling through TikTok, I see videos of women in long floral dresses.

In fact, it's deeply familiar to me as someone who was raised to become a traditional wife.\nBut the stay-at-home life is not as glamorous as it looks on TikTok and Instagram.\nBack in the 1990s and early 2000s, when I was being homeschooled and taught the beliefs of \"biblical patriarchy,\" we didn't have the term \"tradwife,\" and I likely wouldn't have been allowed to watch TikTok videos anyway.\n\"Traditional marriage,\" \"biblical womanhood,\" and \"Quiverfull\" were the terms we most often used to describe our lifestyle, which was founded on Christian fundamentalism.\nChristian or biblical patriarchy is an ideology and religious movement centered around the idea that God is masculine, the ultimate patriarch, which is why men were \"created\" to be leaders in the home, church, and government.\nWomen were called to be homemakers, submitting to their fathers until they married, when they would then submit to their husbands. Men and women had to conform to strictly distinct gender roles.\nAs a homeschooled kid, I was taught many typical subjects, or at least given books about them, but my focus was to grow up and become a stay-at-home wife and mother. I became proficient in cooking, sewing, and cleaning.\nAnything I was taught was framed as something I could use to benefit my future family. Learning math was so that I could help my future husband do his taxes. Learning to play piano was so I could accompany hymn singing.\nI was allowed to skip science one year because it wasn't \"necessary.\"\nWhen I turned 18, I didn't go to college or get a job. I was called a \"stay-at-home daughter\" because I was in training to be a wife. My father told me that I didn't need an education or a career because it wouldn't help me in my calling and would tempt me away from God's righteous path.\nHomemaking was glorified as the ideal calling for women. Instead of video-sharing apps, we had Vision Forum catalogs where gender-specific toys were sold and glossy photographs of girls in frilly dresses and boys in Colonial hunting garb were shown to create an aesthetic of \"the good old days\" when men and women had separate gender roles. Books like So Much More and The Excellent Wife and magazines like Above Rubies and Patriarch extolled this lifestyle as one of beauty and divine purpose.\nSo watching #tradwife content is hauntingly familiar to me. These are not new ideas. It is the same old patriarchy wearing a different dress.\nJust like some of these creators say in their videos, I was also told this lifestyle was a choice, that I wasn't being forced into it. At the same time, I was restricted from outside information, prohibited from going to college, and not allowed to have a job outside the home.\nTheoretically, I could have moved out and chosen my own path, but as someone with limited life skills and insufficient finances, I had no idea how to actually do that when I turned 18.\nNot to mention that going against these gender restrictions would have been \"sinful\" and \"ungodly,\" marking me as an outsider to my family and church. So, even though I was \"choosing\" to be a stay-at-home daughter, I didn't really have any other option.\nToday, when I hear content creators sharing about how they choose to stay home and then say they submit to their husbands in the same video, I understand the dynamics at play behind the scenes.\nThe very concept of submission is that you are giving up your decision-making to someone else. If you \"choose\" to be a stay-at-home wife and give up all financial independence, you are placing yourself in a position where you won't have any choice in the future.\nThese videos are known for their ultra-feminine clothing and cozy cooking tutorials, but underlying many of them is a more disturbing ideology: That a woman is fulfilling her God-given purpose if she is a traditional wife who stays home and submits to her husband.\nAdding the promise of divine blessing to a lifestyle choice makes it more of a command than an act of true consent.\nOne #tradwife content creator named Estee recently shared a video of advice for high school girls who want to become traditional wives one day. \"Stay home as long as you possibly can,\" she says.\nShe goes even further by saying: \"If you want to be a traditional wife in the future, you don't need to go to college.\" In another video, Estee says women don't need prenups if they marry the right man because they can trust him not to betray the relationship. Instead, prayer is the best safeguard against divorce.\nAnother content creator named Jasmine Dinis says in one video that she is teaching her young daughter \"it's perfectly acceptable to depend on a man...that serving her husband and bearing children will be her greatest joy.\" Another video of hers proclaims, \"I used to be really into politics but now I just relax while my husband tells me what to think.\"\nThese words are so familiar that they trigger long-ago memories of being indoctrinated to believe that my only purpose was to be a wife and mother who didn't \"need\" a job or independent thoughts.\nAs I was in my twenties, unmarried and waiting for my father to help me find the perfect husband, I became deeply depressed and felt purposeless.\nServing men didn't bring me true happiness or fulfillment. I wanted to be my own person, but that would have gone directly against the mission to make me a submissive wife.\nAnd I had witnessed many women getting married and having extremely difficult lives as homemakers. They struggled with poverty, impossible expectations, domestic abuse, lack of bodily autonomy, burnout, and shame.\nAbove all, their lack of choice and true agency kept them trapped in unhealthy marriages.\nAnd while the #tradwife trend is fascinating to watch and even aesthetically pleasing for viewers who crave a slower lifestyle, it points to a deeper misogyny in our culture and a dangerous shift toward authoritarianism in American politics, one where women are encouraged to stay home, men are made to be the sole providers, and girls grow up believing they will be better off not having any real decision-making power in their lives.\nGirls like me.\nBut I know change is possible. I found a way to escape, and I will never willingly give up my agency for anyone.\nI'm sharing my story to prevent this kind of suffering in others because while being a stay-at-home [fill in the blank] is a valid choice for many, giving up your agency to submit to a spouse can lead to devastating consequences.\nWhen I tell girls they can be whoever they want, I'm really saying those words to myself, because after decades of being made to feel like I could only be a helpmate, I still need reminding that I have a voice.\nCait West is a writer and editor based in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

        "content": "I felt like I was on top of the world. I was married to my loving husband and together, we had an amazing 17-month-old son whom we both adored. My dream of having kids close in age was about to become a reality, and I was so excited to learn that I was pregnant with my second child.\nAfter my first healthy, stress-free pregnancy, I couldn't wait for my son to have a little sister or brother. My husband, Eli, jumped up and down with joy when we saw the pregnancy test was positive.\nIn the back of my head, I knew that miscarriage was a possibility, but I didn't believe it could happen to me.\nAnd then it did.\nWhen I was eight weeks pregnant, I had my first ultrasound. I was told that my baby had a strong heartbeat. I brought up that I had some light spotting, but the doctor told me not to worry.\n\"Don't worry,\" she said. \"That's normal. It happens.\"\nI breathed a sigh of relief, but I wasn't entirely convinced. My gut feeling turned out to be right.\nI lightly bled for two weeks straight. When the blood suddenly became darker and redder, I reached out to my doctor's office to make an appointment.\nI thought my concerns would be met with care and urgency from my medical team. Instead, I had almost entirely the opposite reaction from those whose help I desired most.\nInsensitive receptionists, limited doctor appointments, and entire days where none of the eight to 10 doctors in practice were in the office, were just a few of the unexpected and stressful challenges I dealt with. It all made my horrifying experience infinitely worse.\nI finally got a follow-up appointment, the morning my husband was leaving for a five-day work trip. He had attended every single doctor's appointment until then.\nI'll never forget the look of pity on the doctor's face as she told me the bad news. Despite having a beating heart, my baby was missing a brain, and I was likely going to miscarry. I would have to wait and see what my body decided to do with the defective fetus.\nEli's flight was delayed, so I was able to catch him before he departed. Eli couldn't even comprehend the news himself, as he was chaperoning his high school boys' softball team for a tournament and had absolutely nobody to speak to about his own sense of loss and the guilt of being away from his wife, who was suffering greatly.\nAs an Orthodox Jew, I faced another level of complication: my cramps worsened over the Sabbath when I couldn't use technology, including making phone calls.\nThere are exceptions if one's life is in danger, but while I was in a whole lot of pain I wasn't sure if it qualified as a life-threatening situation. I sought advice from my next-door neighbor, who threatened to call the doctor herself if I didn't.\nI'm really glad I opened up to someone with a more rational way thinking. It allowed me to remove the stress of wondering if there was anything else I should have been doing.\nWhen I woke up on the final day of my husband being away, I experienced the worst cramps yet. So when I saw a giant, fetus-sized clump of blood in the toilet, I froze completely and had no idea what to do.\nMy instinct was to cover it up as soon as possible. My hand shot out and I immediately flushed it. Not having Eli or someone else more rational than I at that moment was horrifying.\nOf course, this was also one of the days when no doctors were available because the office was moving. I sobbed to multiple receptionists for help, pleading for an ultrasound to see if my whole saga was over.\nBy a stroke of luck, my ultrasound technician happened to pass by one of the kinder receptionists and overheard that I was asking to see someone. She advocated for me and ordered me to come in right away. I am forever grateful to have had one medical angel who was concerned, and showed me the empathy I needed in that moment.\nWhen my husband came home, he was finally able to absorb all that happened and let out his emotions. We gave ourselves some time and grace to mourn the loss.\nI was ultimately able to get pregnant again. I gave birth to a healthy baby girl 10 months later, and one more daughter 5 years later.\nLooking back on my experience, I was surprised that the internet was lacking in relatable content about miscarriages. Other than a few articles and clinical websites, it had nothing that comforted me when I was up way too late in the middle of the night, searching for something, anything, that could tell me how I would survive losing my fetus, as well as so many of my hopes and dreams with it.\nI was under the false impression that people don't talk about miscarriages, since traditionally we don't talk about pregnancies until after the first trimester. I tried to be strong all by myself, but it became very clear I had no idea how to comprehend all of my emotions and physical pains.\nI didn't want any woman who had gone through a miscarriage to feel alone like I did. So I drew what I went through, creating a short comic about my story called, \"Miscarried.\" Actress, Mayim Bialik, also a mother, helped me launch the comic publicly and the feedback was incredible.\nI started getting emails from people all over the world who related to my story and were glad to find that they weren't in this alone. I ended up making a video out of my comic to reach more people. It's launching in May.\nAs awful as my experience was, I'm thankful that I was able to share it. While the world has certainly made some progress in discussing miscarriages and other complications regarding childbirth, there's still a long way to go.\nI hope that by telling my story through my comics, I can help others feel less alone in their struggle and help women understand that sometimes miscarriages, though terrible, can be a natural part of life, and that nothing is wrong with women who miscarry.\nIt's 2024. Nobody should be suffering alone. I want to make sure of that.\nChari Pere, creator of Miscarried: An Unspoken Cartoonmentary, worked as a creative director and illustrator/storyboard artist on projects for Red Bull, Jockey, Disney, Comedy Central, and Bud Light.

I was leaving a friend's house just after 11:00 p.m. and had only made it a few miles when a drunk person driving a truck crossed into my lane and crashed into me at 55 miles per hour, pushing my SUV off the road and into a ditch.\nI often think about what would have happened if I decided to stay longer or leave earlier. Would I still be where I am today? Would the driver crash into someone else instead? I've tried to let these questions go because I cannot change my circumstances and I would not wish that another person had been hurt instead of me.\nAfter the crash occurred, emergency services arrived at the scene and cut me out of my vehicle to put me in a helicopter where I was then taken to the nearest hospital.\nI do not remember much from the crash but I have been burdened with PTSD which makes driving and being a passenger extremely hard. I had various surgeries that repaired my ribs, legs, neck, and lungs. To this day, I still having chronic pain and stress from the events that occurred that day.\nThis whole experience has not only affected me, but those around me also. I may appear like most women my age, but I must face daily unnecessary struggles that I did not ask for. Due to the rate of speed and the type of impact caused, my body will never be the same.\nThe trauma surgeons saved my life that night by putting me back together with hardware in my neck, femur, tibia, foot, and ribs. The impact also caused one of my eyes to cross, which left me with a visual impairment.\nThe most severe injury I had was an Atlanto-occipital dislocation, which in basic terms is an internal decapitation where the skull separates from the spine. I still remember opening my eyes and feeling utter panic while in the hospital. With limited range of motion in my neck and shoulder, driving again was a challenge. I've had to depend on blind spot monitoring in my new vehicle as well as special mirrors.\nDriving while drunk is 100 percent preventable, with so much advancement in technology, people have options to get home safely and should be using them. I have learned from this tragedy that there are good people in life that want to help.\nI found a bigger purpose by sharing my story with MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) to help other survivors and Law Enforcement. There's a great reward for turning my pain into something that might help others. Lastly, I have learned to be grateful for the good days and allow myself grace when my body is in severe pain, when I can't do the things I want or need to do. I believe that we are connected through painful times and I've found ways to look for blessings in this burden.\nStephanie Ronan is an internal decapitation survivor.

From a man's point of view.\"\nLora responded: \"Nah. Nah. I don't care.\"\nThe man, who is off-camera, said sarcastically: \"That's a good attitude,\" to which she replied: \"That's why I'm wearing it. But thanks for your input.\"\nThere has been a huge response to the video, which you can watch here, and Lora told Newsweek the interaction made her \"really angry.\"\n\"We'd just turned on the mic to do a sound check for some street interviews and then it happened,\" she said.\n\"It made me really angry as I was minding my own business and he just thought he could come and say that to me.

It was only a normal denim skirt that loads of people wear!\"\nAnd it's not the first time men have given unwanted comments on her looks, she revealed.\n\"I've done hair modeling and I've had men comment on my hair about how they don't like it and 'why would I do that to myself,'\" she said.\nShe went on: \"Unfortunately I don't think things will change, it seems to be so common and it's sad.\"\nFounder and executive director of Stop Street Harassment, Holly Kearl, previously told Newsweek that there is no \"right\" way to deal with harassers.\n\"Every situation and person are different and often a person only has a second or two to assess their safety and decide what to do,\" she said. \"Whatever people choose in that second as their response is fine.\"\nShe urged caution however, as \"many harassers are trying to exert power and if they feel threatened by the response, they may escalate.\"\nWhile Lora is based in Birmingham in the U.K., in the United States, one in three women and approximately one in nine men have experienced sexual harassment in a public place, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nLora has received some major support from some commenters on her video, such as one user who wrote: \"Perfect response, hopefully he thinks twice about giving his unsolicited opinion next time!\"\n\"I think 'nah' was the perfect response,\" another user wrote, while one said: \"Nah. Nah. Love it.\" Another commented: \"Well said!\"\nBut some accused her of wanting \"attention\" or even faking the video, though Lora was quickly defended by other users in the comments.\nLora told Newsweek: \"I get a bit of hate on some of my videos as I do street interviews, so to get some support is really nice. We need to stick together and lift each other up rather than bring each other down.\"\nSharing some advice, she urged people to \"stay safe and always be careful.\"\n\"Keep your phones on you and make sure people know where you are if you're alone.

Since her video was posted on April 11, it has received 1.1 million views, over 111,000 likes and over 840 comments.\n\"There is nothing more superior than having your significant other leave in the morning before you, and you get to stay in bed,\" Napolitano said in the video. \"They're like, 'Bye,' and you just get to stay in bed.

I'm not a morning person, so I just love the few extra hours to lay in bed and relax before getting my day started.\"\nNapolitano said she has a constant appreciation for this set-up, especially since it hasn't always been the case: \"In previous relationships, I was the one getting up first and leaving to go to work, and I hated it,\" she added. \"I was out the door at 6 a.m. and he was in bed until 1 p.m., which made for a very difficult dynamic.\"\nWhen asked what she does on the weekends when nobody is determined to exercise at 5 a.m., Napolitano said she enjoys longer morning rituals with her boyfriend.\n\"My favorite morning rituals with my boyfriend are having coffee together and walking the dog together,\" she said. \"On the weekends, we do this and get a coffee outside with no phones, which I love. We always follow it up with a workout, either Pilates or a run.\"\nViewers in the comments could equally resonate with both the \"stay in bed girlfriend\" and the early-rising partner.\n\"Literally, getting to sprawl out and have the whole bed to yourself again is the best,\" @mackenzie.steen wrote.\n\"I go first and I'm mad about it every single day,\" @alyssasantostefano posted.\nHowever, some are saying life can get even better than Napolitano describes.\n\"Superior is when you have to leave first, but your boyfriend still wakes up with you and packs your lunch, and makes you coffee,\" @legal_marinara commented.\n",

The National Coffee Association reported in 2022 that Americans drank about 517 million cups of coffee daily, and the stimulating drink had become increasingly popular among people ages 18 to 24.\nOhlson said she felt like she had no choice but to eliminate caffeine from her diet after noticing several side effects, including eye twitches and gut problems.\n\"Since quitting caffeine, I wake up with more energy. I don't feel the need to drink a coffee first thing in the morning,\" Ohlson said. \"I feel more focused and at ease throughout the day.\"\n\"I had a constant eye twitch and always felt on edge,\" Ohlson said of the effects caffeine had on her. \"Along with anxiety, I noticed gut problems—even when hydrating and eating before consumption—inflammation and acne, and heightened premenstrual syndrome symptoms, such as mood swings, and cramps.\"\nShe added: \"I wanted to feel and look my healthiest. So I decided to see how I would feel without caffeine.\"\nAccording to Johns Hopkins Medicine, coffee has numerous advantages, including increasing vitality and preventing serious illnesses, such as Parkinson's and heart failure. However, it's not the greatest option for anxious individuals.\nAmy Baertschi, a registered dietitian, spoke with Newsweek about the links between coffee and anxiety.\n\"It's important to remember that caffeine is a central nervous stimulant and will raise heart rate, blood pressure, and may cause heart palpitations if consumed in higher doses,\" said Baertschi, who lives in Zurich.\nShe continued: \"For people with preexisting anxiety, adding something that will exacerbate the symptoms of anxiety (such as heart palpitations or increased heart rate) will only make symptoms worse.\"\nDuring the TikTok video, which has received more than 101,000 views and 12,000 likes, Ohlson said quitting caffeine \"cured\" her. She added that she was mentally in a better place and that her skin had \"never been this clear and this glowy.\"\nShe told Newsweek: \"I am a beverage girl. I love waking up and drinking a coffee or juice. The hardest part of giving up caffeine was losing the ritual of it.\"\nAccording to the CDC, three to five cups of plain coffee is OK as part of a healthy diet. Ohlson said she replaced coffee with water that contained electrolytes—though she hasn't ruled out the odd latte as a \"treat.\"\nShe said: \"I also remind myself that everything in moderation is important. I still love coffee, so I opt for decaf when I am craving one. However, I have treated myself to two lattes since March.\n\"Overall, my mental health has been better, and I no longer struggle with horrible anxiety. Of course, I have my day, but when I am anxious, I feel like I have more control and can deal with it a lot easier.\"\nIn the video's comments section, TikTok users shared their experiences quitting caffeine or moderating their intake.\n\"I stopped drinking caffeine on an empty stomach (I knew it was bad for me) and omg my anxiety lessened SO MUCH,\" one user wrote.\n\"Ughhh I'm moody without caffeine I want to but I can't,\" another added.\nA commenter said: \"I did the same thing!!! Caffeine was making me so anxious [and] cutting it pretty much cured me.\"\nIs there a health issue that's worrying you? Let us know via health@newsweek.com.

        "content": "A mom has shared footage of her 5-year-old son eating a chicken nugget for the first time, saying it represents a significant breakthrough for her family.\nFor most families, a trip to Chick-fil-A is nothing to write home about. But it's different for Emily Marie Losier and son Dax, who live in Pennsylvania. Dax has autism spectrum disorder and struggles with what his mom terms \"extreme food aversion.\"\n\"Dax has a very sensitive gag reflex,\" Losier told Newsweek. \"So if he has it in his mind that he doesn't like something, no matter how it tastes, he will just throw up. I learned that lesson by trying to 'make' him taste something one time and one time only.\"\nLosier said Dax first started to refuse certain foods when he was 2. \"He would literally cover his hand with his mouth and from food he didn't want to try,\" she said. Instead, he insists on eating only what he considers \"comfortable, safe food.\"\n\"He absolutely loves spaghetti,\" Losier said. \"He would live on it. The only way I can get him to eat meat is ground beef in spaghetti sauce or sometimes a meatball or two. He also likes scrambled eggs, pizza, Mac 'n' cheese, french fries and most fruits. He loves watermelon.\"\nThis in itself makes life difficult for Losier as a mom trying to make sure her son enjoys a healthy and balanced diet. \"He does eat gummy daily vitamins, but I still worry about his long-term health,\" she said.\nAlso, Dax \"never feels full\" and will \"literally cry for more food that he likes no matter how much he's eaten,\" she said.\nBut what exacerbates the situation for Losier is the lack of understanding shown by many people.\nWhen she first uploaded the videos to TikTok detailing Dax's situation, some of the responses left her upset. \"I definitely feel like we need more awareness,\" Losier said. \"Some of my comment sections are so awful, telling me I should starve him or force him to eat, and it just is not that simple.\"\nBut Dax isn't alone in experiencing these struggles with food. Cherie Miller, an eating disorder psychotherapist, said he might have an eating disorder called avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), which is not an uncommon challenge for autistic kids.\n\"ARFID involves limitations in the amount and/or types of food a person will eat,\" Miller told Newsweek. \"There are three common subtypes of ARFID, and they have different reasons for the restriction: sensory sensitivities, fear of bad things happening—e.g., gagging, choking, vomiting—and a general lack of appetite and an apathy towards food.\"\nMiller said that while parents should seek the help of a therapist and dietitian specializing in eating disorders, as well as a pediatrician, parents can help address the problem.\n\"Treatment for these types of food issues in children does involve challenging kids to eat foods they are afraid to eat, but a gentle approach is best,\" she said. \"That means taking things slow to give kids time to learn coping skills to manage their anxiety and offering lots of support and encouragement.\"\nThat's another element of what made Dax's breakthrough with the chicken nugget so special. It came with the love and support of his mom, who offered quiet encouragement as he took those small but significant bites.\n\"I was nervous right before that he would throw up all over Chick-fil-A, but when he took that bite and chewed it up, I was incredibly proud of him,\" Losier said. \"He has had some other irrational fears that he has overcome recently—after much work—so I think that may have been boosting his confidence as well.\"\nLosier said she originally filmed the video to share it with her family. \"I was so excited after years of attempts by myself and my whole family to get him to try chicken that I wanted to video it.\"\nShe also wanted to thank the staff at the Westmoreland Mall branch of Chick-fil-A in Greensburg for providing the meal for free after learning about Dax's situation.\nLosier ended up posting the clip online, partly because she wanted to offer encouragement to other parents who may be in a similar position.\n\"I hope that it can give some hope to other parents struggling with the same issues,\" she said. \"Keep working with them. Keep offering. Be patient. You never know when they will wake up and decide that today they will say yes to tasting the chicken nugget.\"\n",

        "content": "Two polls have suggested Donald Trump will lose the presidential election, in the latest swing in what has been a tight race so far.\nIn March, the former leader and the incumbent President Joe Biden won enough primary races to secure, respectively, the Republican and Democratic nominations in the 2024 presidential election. Polls have so far shown that the results will be tight as the pair are statistically tied in most surveys or enjoying only marginal leads.\nHowever, two recent polls have suggested Trump is now lagging, marginally. In one poll of 1,046 adults by Florida Atlantic University and Mainstreet Research, 40 percent of all voters said they would vote for Biden and 38 percent would choose Trump in a race in which independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was included.\nWhen only likely voters were polled, 44 percent said they would vote for Biden and 39 percent for Trump.\nThe poll also found that in a two-person race where likely voters were polled, 47 percent would vote for Biden and 46 percent would vote for Trump.\nHowever in a two-person race when all voters were polled, Trump and Biden were tied with 44 percent of the vote each.\nThe poll was conducted between April 26 and April 28. The margin of error is +/- 3 percent.\nMeanwhile, a Reuters/Ipsos poll of 856 registered voters, which closed on Tuesday, found that 40 percent of registered voters would vote for Biden compared with 39 percent who would vote for Trump. However, the one percent lead is down from a four-point lead Biden had in a poll conducted by Reuters/Ipsos earlier in the month.\nThe survey has a 3 percentage point margin of error.\nNewsweek contacted Trump's campaign representative by email to comment on this story.\nMeanwhile, other recent polls have shown Trump is in the lead.\nA CNN poll of 1,212 people conducted by SSRS, an independent research company, between April 18 and 23 found that 49 percent of registered voters supported Trump, while 43 percent supported Biden, for instance.\nAn April poll by Bloomberg News and Morning Consult also indicated that Trump was polling ahead in six key swing states, by 6 points overall.\nAs these swing states may determine the result of the election, these polls are arguably more important than national polls.\nThomas Gift, who heads the Centre on U.S. Politics at University College London, previously told Newsweek that reading too much into polls was \"a fool's errand.\"\n\"Polls are so variable at this point that the only consistent insight we can glean from them is that Biden and Trump are neck and neck—not only nationally but in key swing states,\" he said. \"Trying to read too much into any one poll, or even set of polls, five months out from the election is a fool's errand.\"\nThe presidential election will take place on November 5.\n",

The response has been so staggering that organizers have decided to end the fundraiser as of Friday.\n\"We've been overwhelmed by the sheer force of patriotism on display,\" John Noonan, the organizer, said in a statement sent to Newsweek. \"What started as a simple gesture to reward a courageous act has captured the attention of millions, representing a wide spectrum of the American public.\"\nBy Friday morning, the GoFundMe had raised more than $516,000 from over 14,800 donors. Three donors — identified on the site as John Clark, Adam Sinn, and William Ackman, the outspoken billionaire investor — gave $10,000 each. A Republican congressman from Georgia, Mike Collins, donated $125. Susan Ralston, a former advisor to George W. Bush, also made a contribution and is listed an organizer.\nDespite the overwhelming public response, the fundraiser has stirred some controversy online, particularly concerning its management and transparency. The Pi Kappa Phi chapter at UNC clarified that they were unaware of Noonan's actions and had not authorized the campaign.\n\"We do not know John Noonan and we have been attempting to contact him,\" the fraternity wrote in an email to the local radio station WUNC on Thursday.\nA national Pi Kappa Phi spokeswoman told Newsweek that they did not set up the fundraiser and are not endorsing it.\nAccording to Noonan, who is a former aide to Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton, plans now include not only the promised \"rager\" but also charitable donations. An independent entity, featuring a board of directors along with representation from the fraternity, is being formed to ensure that the funds are used according to donor intent.\nBefore the campaign concluded, Noonan laid out the dual plans of the donations: \"There is nearly half a million in the bank. That is plenty to throw a killer party and give to some great charities.\"\nThe rapid influx of funds and support prompted the organizers to scale up their original plans. Volunteers have been drafted to manage the offers to contribute merchandise, entertainment, and more, Noonan said. A seasoned professional planner has also been retained to handle the complex logistics for the party.\n\"With graduation just around the corner, final exams in full swing, and continued drama on campus, we think it is best to take our time and plan this right,\" Noonan wrote on GoFundMe.\nThe viral incident that kicked off the fundraiser happened when pro-Palestinian demonstrators had replaced the U.S. flag on the campus' main quad with a Palestinian flag. Members of the UNC Chapel Hill chapter of the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity intervened to prevent the American flag from touching the ground, coming under both verbal and physical attacks as they held it up, according to video that circulated widely on social media.\nLike many other elite universities across the U.S., the bucolic Chapel Hill campus has been embroiled in protests between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli groups, who hold differing views on Israel's offensive in Gaza. More than 2,000 people across the country have been arrested since the protests began.\nThe protest movement originated at Columbia University, where students established an encampment demanding the university divest from companies linked to Israel over that country's ongoing war in Gaza, which followed a deadly attack by Hamas on southern Israel on October 7 in which militants killed 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage.\nIn retaliation, Israel's subsequent bombardment of Gaza has caused more than 34,000 deaths, according to the latest report by the Associated Press citing the local Hamas-run health ministry.\nUpdate 5/3/24 1:30 p.m. ET: This story has been corrected to note that Tom Cotton is a senator from Arkansas, not Texas. We regret the error.\n",

Daniels is also said to have urged Davidson to settle the negotiations for the hush money quickly over fears she would lose leverage if Trump lost the election.\nEliason said on X that the attempts by Trump's legal team to suggest Daniels wanted the payment before the 2016 election to maintain leverage over Trump could also help the prosecution set out to the jury why the former president wanted to pay it.\n\"The defense bringing out that Daniels would lose all 'leverage' if the story wasn't purchased before the election is supposed to make it sound like extortion,\" Eliason wrote. \"But it actually helps the prosecution: the story had value to Trump only [because] of its ability to influence the election.\"\nExpanding on his remarks, Eliason told Newsweek: \"Everyone involved recognized that suppressing the story only had value to Trump prior to the election; after that he wouldn't care and wouldn't pay.\n\"The purpose of the hush money was not to avoid public embarrassment or keep the story from Melania—which could be done at any time—it was to influence the election. That is the prosecution's primary theory of the case, and the defense cross of Davidson helped reinforce it.\"\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in relation to $130,000 he arranged for Cohen to pay Daniels to keep an alleged affair she had with Trump secret in the run-up to the 2016 election, which was later listed in company records as Cohen's \"legal fees.\" Prosecutors suggested the payment was part of an unlawful attempt to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential race.\nNewsweek has contacted Donald Trump's legal team for comment via email.\nGeorge Grasso, a former judge at the New York City Criminal Court in Kings County, said Davidson \"produced some fireworks\" during his testimony, with Bove also conducting a \"fiery\" cross-examination.\n\"All told, while the witness had to endure some uncomfortable moments, his testimony appeared to hold together regarding his key role in facilitating the 'hush money' payments at the heart of the People's case,\" Grasso told Newsweek.\nTrump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, said he reimbursed the $130,000 payment to Cohen but denied having an affair with Daniels.\nIn April 2023, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office released a statement of facts about its investigation that said Trump instructed Cohen to delay paying Daniels the $130,000 sum for \"as long as possible\" in the hope that after the 2016 election they could \"avoid paying altogether, because at that point it would not matter if the story became public.\"\nElsewhere during Thursday's proceedings, Bove suggested Davidson approached breaking the law when he sought money from celebrities to stop potentially embarrassing stories about them from becoming public, including an alleged attempt to seek cash from wrestler Hulk Hogan in exchange for a sex tape.\n\"You were pretty well-versed in getting right up to the line without committing extortion, right?\" Bove asked.\nDavidson denied ever committing extortion, saying the settlements he reached with public figures were fair and legitimate.\nUpdate 5/3/24, 10:53 a.m. ET: This article has been updated with further comment from Randall Eliason.\n",

        "content": "Gen Z has been largely left out of Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness options this year, and many are struggling to pay off their monthly payments as they navigate low starting salaries and economic uncertainty.\nRead more: Student Loan Forgiveness Updates and FAQs\nGen Z—born from 1997-2012—graduated during an uncertain job market, with many entering the workforce right when the pandemic upended companies and shifted to a remote work culture. At the same time, the generation has faced some of the highest educational costs, with the average college tuition and fees at a four-year school costing $19,806 per year during the 2021-2022 school year.\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Gen Z has an average of $20,900 in student debt, which is 13 percent higher than millennials. That translates to a median loan of $12,800, which again is around 14 percent higher than that of millennials.\nDespite these factors, the Department of Education has not included Gen Z in most of the student loan relief options available to federal borrowers.\nBiden's current relief initiatives target those who took out loans more than 20 or 25 years ago or those who have worked in public service for 10 or more years.\nAltogether, Biden has canceled almost $160 billion for 4.6 million borrowers, but the majority of that relief comes after years of making loan payments, making Gen Z ineligible since they only recently graduated college or are still attending.\nMichael Lux, an attorney and the founder of the Student Loan Sherpa, said the majority of student debt relief has gone to older borrowers, but it was for a specific reason.\nRead more: Compare 12 of the Best Refinance Student Loans\n\"I'd also say that it is intentional. For many years, borrowers received lousy advice from loan servicers and the Biden fixes have attempted to fix these issues,\" Lux told Newsweek.\nOther times, loan relief went out to borrowers who attended misleading for-profit schools. Most recently, Biden passed $6.1 billion in student debt cancellation for the 317,000 borrowers who attended The Art Institutes.\nThis relief came as the organization \"falsified data, knowingly misled students, and cheated borrowers into taking on mountains of debt without leading to promising career prospects at the end of their studies,\" Biden said.\nThe institution closed its campuses last year after facing fraud accusations, and now everyone who attended The Art Institutes between January 1, 2004, and October 16, 2017, is eligible for forgiveness.\nNot all of Biden's attempts to cancel student debt have been fruitful, though. His administration initially passed $430 billion in student debt forgiveness, but the Supreme Court struck down the policy last year.\nUnder that policy, Biden would have seen more than 40 million Americans benefit, including many Gen Z-ers. The program hoped to offer $10,000 in relief to all borrowers earning less than $125,000. All borrowers who were Pell Grant recipients and came from a low-income background qualified for $20,000 in relief.\nStill, Gen Z is bound to benefit from Biden's loan forgiveness—it just might not be as immediate.\nThe new SAVE plan the Education Department has offered will see many Gen Z-ers get lower student loan bills monthly, if not full forgiveness down the line.\nUnder SAVE, borrowers will have their monthly payments calculated based on their income and family size, with many remaining balances forgiven after several years. Via the new repayment plan, monthly payments range from 5 to 10 percent of a borrower's discretionary income.\nBut none of the relief available negates the overarching problem that has led to the student loan forgiveness policies, Lux said.\nRead more: When Is the FAFSA Deadline?\n\"Ultimately, the root problem with student loans is that college is too expensive,\" Lux said. \"The forgiveness programs help people impacted by this issue, but it does nothing to lower the cost of college.\"\nAs Gen Z waits it out, many might feel tempted to forego their loan payments until another large-scale debt relief plan comes their way, but this would be a mistake, according to Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor at the University of Tennessee at Martin.\n\"It looks like Gen Z student loan holders will mostly have to wait to take advantage of forgiveness programs until 10 years or more after the start of their payments, but they should wait with caution and still make their monthly payments,\" Beene told Newsweek. \"There's no guarantee there will be forgiveness plans down the line, and avoiding your student loan payments will have long-term financial repercussions on their credit score.\"\n",

Like Wordle, a word-based game that took the English-speaking world by storm during the height of the coronavirus pandemic, Connections quickly gained both success and a dedicated fan base trying each day to crack the categories.\nThe idea of the game is to sort a total of 16 words into four categories, each made up of four words. The words in each category all share something in common, and it's your goal to figure out what exactly that is.\nThe categories differ in difficulty—those in the blue category tend to be the easiest to guess. After that, there are the yellow and green categories, and those words lighting up purple are often the hardest to guess. Some words may have several meanings and could fall into a number of categories, so watch out for those!\nOnce you make your selections, you can press \"submit,\" and see if you're right.

An Amber Alert was issued for the baby and describes Torres as 28 inches tall and weighing 23 pounds with brown eyes and brown hair.\nThe investigation began after the CPD received a call around 4:30 p.m. on Friday that two female bodies were discovered at Ned Houk Park near Clovis. The female victims, who were both 23 years old and from Texico, New Mexico, were identified by police as Samantha Cisneros and Taryn Allen, according to CPD. Both women were found with \"apparent gunshot wounds, laying on the ground near a silver Dodge minivan,\" police said.\n\"A young female child was also found on the ground suffering from an injury to her head,\" CPD said. \"Officers began giving life-saving measures to the child.\"\nThe little girl was rushed by Clovis EMS to Plains Regional Medical Center before being transferred to a hospital near Lubbock, Texas. The 5-year-old's condition was unknown at the time of publication on Saturday night.\nNewsweek reached out via email on Saturday night to the CPD comment and an update on the case.\nWhen investigators discovered an infant car seat, stroller and a baby bottle at the scene, they became concerned there was an infant child with the female victims when they were killed and immediately began search efforts.\n\"Through interviews with family members, investigators learned Samantha Cisneros was the mother to the young female child found at the scene and was also the mother to a 10-month-old child, Eleia Maria Torres,\" CPD said. \" Investigators believe Eleia Maria Torres has been abducted by the perpetrator of this crime and is in immediate danger.\"\nAuthorities have not identified a suspect or possible motive for the shooting and kidnapping and said the investigation is ongoing, according to a statement by the New Mexico State Police (NMSP).\nState police said a potential person of interest was believed to be driving a maroon Honda vehicle.\n\"Many details about this incident are unknown and under investigation, but of urgent concern is the whereabouts of Eleia Maria Torres,\" NMSP said. \"If you have any information about this incident or the whereabouts of Eleia Maria Torres please call the Clovis Police Department or 911.\"\nNewsweek reached out via email on Saturday night to NMSP for comment.\nNMSP and CPD urge anyone who has information regarding the victims or was at Ned Houk Park on May 3 to call 575-769-1921 and anonymous tips can be provided to the Curry County Crime Stoppers at 575-763-7000.\n",

        "content": "After pro-Palestinian protesters briefly disrupted the University of Michigan's graduation ceremony on Saturday, videos shared to social media show the moment the crowd erupted into cheers as the group of students was escorted to the back of the venue.\nAbout 75 people, many of whom held Palestinian flags and signs, protested on Saturday afternoon during the university's spring graduation ceremony at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor.\nThe protesters marched up the main aisle while chanting and carrying signs, including a banner that read: \"No universities left in Gaza.\" While photos captured during the ceremony show numerous students donning traditional Arabic keffiyeh with their graduation caps, at least one decorated his cap with the Israeli flag.\nAbove the stadium, planes flew competing messages, with one reading, \"Divest from Israel now! Free Palestine!\" while the other read: \"We stand with Israel. Jewish lives matter,\" the Associated Press reported.\nUniversity of Michigan spokesperson Colleen Mastony told Newsweek in an email on Saturday evening that no one was arrested and said the protest did not delay the nearly two-hour ceremony, which \"celebrated the achievements of 8,500 undergraduates and 6,622 graduate and PhD students before a crowd of 62,000 wellwishers.\"\n\"The mood was joyous and the ceremony unfolded successfully and was completed without interruption,\" Mastony said. \"Approximately 75 protesters staged a small demonstration at the beginning of the program, walking up the main aisle and chanting before public safety personnel escorted them to the rear of the stadium, where they remained through the conclusion of the event.\"\nMastony continued: \"Peaceful protests like this have taken place at U-M commencement ceremonies for decades. The university supports free speech and expression, and university leaders are pleased that today's commencement was such a proud and triumphant moment, worthy of the achievements of our extraordinary graduates.\"\nVideos shared to X, formerly Twitter, show the demonstration and the moment the crowd erupts into cheers as the group is escorted away. However, it was unclear at the time of publication whether the crowd was cheering in support or opposition.\nThe videos show protesters chanting phrases such as \"Disclose, divest, we will not stop, we will not rest,\" and \"Regents, regents, you can't hide! You are funding genocide.\" Israel has rejected the allegation that its actions in Gaza are genocidal.\nAnother video appears to show people chanting in response to the protesters, yelling \"Shut the f*** up.\"\nX user Aviva Klompas captioned the clip: \"The pro-terror mob is currently ruining graduation day at@UMich.\"\nAuthor Oil London shared a video of the demonstration and wrote: \"University of Michigan commencement ceremony RUINED after mob of anti-Israel activists stormed the ceremony waving Palestinian flags. 'Palestine will live forever.'\"\nAdam Y. Abusalah also shared a video of the protest on X, writing: \"Graduates at the University of Michigan demonstrate for Palestine at the commencement ceremony in Ann Arbor today. 'Disclose, divest, we will not stop, we will not rest.'\"\nU.S. Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro, a commencement speaker, paused several times during his remarks, before saying, \"Ladies and gentlemen, if you can please draw your attention back to the podium,\" the AP reported.\nMeanwhile, pro-Palestinian demonstrations have spread across campuses in the U.S. following the arrests of protesters who set up a \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment\" at Columbia University in New York City on April 18. Since then, encampment demonstrations began popping up at universities all over the country, and hundreds of protesters have been arrested. Participants have been demanding that universities divest from companies supporting Israel as well as a permanent ceasefire to end the Israel-Hamas war.\nIsrael responded militarily after Hamas, a Palestinian militant group, launched a surprise attack on October 7, 2023, on the country that killed roughly 1,200 people and saw over 200 more taken hostage into Gaza. In nearly seven months of fighting, the Palestinian death toll has surpassed 34,000, with more than 76,000 injured in the besieged territory, according to the AP, per the Gaza Health Ministry, which notes that at least two-thirds have been children and women.\nThe staggering number of Palestinian deaths has sparked widespread condemnation from across the globe. Meanwhile, some protests have turned disruptive and violent, prompting police intervention and causing top U.S. lawmakers to pass legislation. Last week, the House of Representatives approved the Antisemitism Awareness Act to address reports of rising antisemitism on college campuses amid allegations of Jewish students being targeted during campus protests.\n",

        "content": "Legal analyst Steve Vladeck wrote Saturday in an opinion piece for MSNBC that a recent move by former President Donald Trump's lawyers in his Mar-a-Lago classified documents case is \"doomed to fail.\"\nIn a new motion filed on Thursday to U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who is overseeing the case and was appointed by the former president in 2020, Trump's lawyers argue that a Chinese immigrant's 1886 Supreme Court triumph provides \"selective prosecution\" precedent for throwing out Trump's charges in the classified documents case.\nTrump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has pleaded not guilty to Department of Justice (DOJ) special counsel Jack Smith's 40 charges where it's alleged that he retained classified materials after he left the White House in January 2021 and then obstructed the federal attempt to retrieve them from his Mar-a-Lago resort residence in Palm Beach, Florida.\nTrump's team cites the Court case, Yick Wo v. Hopkins, involving \"Lee Yick,\" who was convicted for operating an unlicensed laundry in San Francisco. The immigrant sued and eventually won a landmark Supreme Court case that stated that Yick's Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution's 14th Amendment was being violated.\nIn the case's decision, Justice Stanley Matthews wrote that even if a law's wording appears fair, the Constitution bars the law if it is administered \"with an evil eye and unequal hand, so as practically to make unjust and illegal discrimination.\"\nHowever, Vladeck contends in his opinion piece that Trump's lawyers will struggle to convince Cannon that their client is comparable to Yick and his Supreme Court argument.\n\"Like claims about the unfairness of pretrial detention or the severity of the sentences in the Jan. 6 cases, there is a familiar — and perverse — irony at the bottom of Trump's selective prosecution argument,\" Vladeck, a University of Texas School of Law professor, wrote. \"Maybe we ought to discuss limiting the circumstances, in general, in which pretrial defendants can be detained. Maybe we ought to discuss reforms to all federal criminal sentences. Maybe we ought to discuss making it easier for defendants to establish selective prosecution claims. But as the selective prosecution claim in the Mar-a-Lago case makes clear, Trump isn't the poster child for these reforms; he's the anti-poster-child. Indeed, he's in the position he's in entirely because his behavior went so far beyond the limits of that of any of his predecessors.\"\nHe added: \"That wasn't true of Lee Yick, and that why Trump's arguments that he's just like Lee Yick are doomed to fail.\"\nNewsweek reached out to Trump lawyer Todd Blanche Saturday afternoon through his website. This story will be updated with any provided statements.\nThe trial date in the classified documents case has yet to be finalized, but Cannon is expected to postpone it beyond its scheduled start date of May 20.\nVladeck also provided two \"fatal problems\" to Trump's new motion, which was filed by Blanche and Chris Kise.\n\"First, for better or worse, the Supreme Court has made selective prosecution claims notoriously difficult to prove. Second, Trump is just about the worst possible person to bring a selective prosecution claim — since so much of his allegedly unlawful conduct in the Mar-a-Lago case is unprecedented,\" Vladeck wrote in his opinion piece. \"Only if the defendant could prove that the government had deliberately and intentionally singled him out from other similarly situated suspects without any good reason would such a claim succeed.\"\nIn the motion to Cannon, Trump attorneys list current and former government officials, including President Joe Biden, Trump's former Vice President Mike Pence and Trump's former 2016 opponent in the presidential race, Hillary Clinton. They claim that Trump's rivals have acted similarly to the former president in the Mar-a-Lago documents case, but \"no one in the government lifted a finger\" to their actions.\nRobert Hur, the DOJ's special counsel who investigated classified documents found at Biden's home and former offices, said in February that the president cooperated with his probe, which were among several \"material distinctions\" compared to Trump's documents case. Hur didn't bring charges against Biden, but found evidence that Biden willfully held onto sensitive material after he left the vice presidency in 2017.\nTrump's lawyers outline that Pence was found to be holding onto classified documents at his home in Indiana yet was not indicted. The motion says that Pence made a number of disclosures to the National Archives and Records Administration [NARA] after leaving the White House.\nThey also pointed to Clinton's use of a private email server for official messages when she was secretary of state under former President Barack Obama. The FBI did investigate Clinton and chose not to indict.\n\"For try as his brief might, it doesn't identify any other cases with similar claims about affirmative misrepresentations concerning the suspect's retention of classified information. Because there aren't any,\" Vladeck wrote. \"Indeed, the reason Trump's selective prosecution claim should fail is because of how much worse the conduct alleged in the Mar-a-Lago case is than that of the other officials his brief invokes as the relevant exemplars.\"\nHe added: \"In the court of public opinion, where facts don't matter all that much, Trump and his supporters can wave their hands and make the cases look similar. But in a court of law, that's not enough — and shouldn't be enough.\"\n",

        "content": "Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, rebuked Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson, calling it an \"utterly ridiculous\" plan on Saturday.\nGreene, a Georgia Republican, announced on Wednesday that she plans to call a vote on her previously unprivileged motion to vacate Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, sparking criticism from several members of the GOP who warned the move may be damaging to the party.\nGreene introduced the motion to vacate Johnson in March after he passed the $1.2 trillion spending package with Democratic support to fund the government. Greene, a staunch supporter of former President Donald Trump, has continued to scrutinize Johnson over his support for the bipartisan spending bill that includes $60.8 billion of aid to Ukraine in its ongoing war with Russia. Meanwhile, Johnson has continued to face mounting criticism from House conservatives as he pushed forward the bill, which passed House legislation late last month.\nSince Greene's announcement, several Republicans have criticized the congresswoman.\nCruz rebuked Greene's plans on Saturday as he told The Hill, \"I think it is utterly ridiculous and counterproductive.\"\nSenator Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, also criticized Greene on CNN late last month, describing her as \"uninformed\" and a \"total waste of time.\"\n\"She is a horrible leader. She is dragging our brand down. She, not the Democrats, are the biggest risk to us getting back to a majority,\" he said.\nHowever, Greene has previously fired back at her critics as she said that she doesn't \"give a rat's a**\" what her colleagues think about her hopes to remove Johnson.\n\"I voted for Mike Johnson because his voting record before he became speaker was conservative. But once he became speaker, he has become a man that none of us recognize,\" the congresswoman said Wednesday at a news conference announcing her plans to hold a vote.\nNewsweek has reached out to Cruz and Greene's office via email for additional comment.\nSo far, only two other Republicans have come out in support of Greene, Representatives Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona.\nMeanwhile, the House Democratic leadership has also said it is against the vote.\nIf a vote is held on the motion to vacate, Johnson may need to turn to Democrats to save his speakership due to the GOP's slim 4-seat majority. Due to other vacancies, this would leave Johnson with room for only one Republican detractor, barring any Democratic support.\nIn addition, Representatives Anna Paulina Luna and Matt Gaetz, both Florida Republicans, have warned that Greene's efforts could also lead to the possibility that a Democrat could become speaker.\nDuring an interview on Rumble with Gaetz last month, Luna reiterated her criticisms of Johnson, but warned against the possibility that a Democrat could become speaker.\n\"The Uniparty has prioritized foreign interests again and placed America last. Speaker Johnson has gone back on most of what he said when we elected him to be Speaker, rendering him almost unrecognizable as a legislator and the leader we chose. That being said, the possibility of a Democratic-controlled House poses a greater risk. We stand as the last barrier that has stopped Biden from completely ruining our country. Given our historically narrow majority, we must not allow the gavel to pass to the Democrats,\" Luna previously told Newsweek.\nMeanwhile, in response to the recent calls for Johnson to vacate, the House speaker warned about what a motion to vacate would mean for Congress during a press conference last month.\n\"I don't think that would be helpful to us from a political standpoint for the Republican Party to continue to govern, maintain and keep our majority in November. I think that would have been a great hindrance to it. And so, that wouldn't be helpful. Nor does a motion to vacate help us in that regard, either. It would be chaos in the House,\" he said.\n",

        "content": "Moscow has accused the U.S. and other allies of Ukraine of preparing strikes on Crimea, warning that in such a scenario, there would be \"retaliation.\"\nRussian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told a briefing on Friday that the Crimean bridge, which links Russia with the peninsula illegally annexed by Moscow since 2014, was \"again under attack.\"\nOver the course of the war started by Vladimir Putin, there have been repeated strikes on the bridge, also known as the Kerch Bridge. The structure for Kyiv symbolizes Russian occupation but is also a key link to transport Moscow's troops and equipment to the frontline and a strike on it could impact its war effort.\nAs well as the bridge, Ukraine has also stepped up its attacks on Russian naval assets in the wider region with repeated strikes on vessels and infrastructure belonging to the Black Sea Fleet, much of which Moscow has relocated to Novorossiysk, in Russia's Krasnodar region.\nZakharova said preparations \"are being carried out openly, with ostentatious bravado and with the absolute and direct support of the collective West.\"\nShe referred to the reported delivery of U.S.-supplied ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems) long range missiles last month, citing the Russian defense ministry's claim that six of the missiles had been shot down over the peninsula last week.\nU.S. officials said last month that Kyiv had started using ATACMS missiles for the first time on a Russian military airfield in Crimea, hitting Russian forces in another occupied area.\nWashington had first delivered mid-range older models of ATACMS missiles last year with a shorter range of around 100 miles but the newer missiles have a range of up to 190 miles, potentially putting hundreds of Russian military facilities in Crimea within range.\nIn her briefing, Zakharova also noted reports that Kyiv was set to receive its first delivery of F-16 aircraft, \"which, according to the British, can also be used in the operation to destroy the Crimean Bridge.\"\n\"We would like to once again warn Washington, London and Brussels that any aggressive actions against Crimea are not only doomed to failure, but will also receive an indestructible blow of retaliation,\" she said, without specifying further.\nNewsweek has contacted the U.S. State Department for comment.\nFollowing her comments, the Russian defense ministry said on Saturday its air defense forces shot down four ATACMS missiles over the Crimean Peninsula, claiming that they had successfully downed 15 of the missiles in recent weeks.\nRussia often claims to have downed Ukrainian missiles and drones without reporting damage, although later reports can show how military targets or infrastructure have actually been struck.\n",

This was seized upon by Volodin who used disparaging language about mental illness to take aim at Zelensky and Biden.\n\"According to these criteria, the first who should be drafted into the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are Biden as a mentally challenged person, as well as his friend Zelensky as a mental patient dependent on various drugs,\" Volodin wrote.\nNewsweek has contacted the White House and Zelensky's office for comment.\nFaced by dwindling troop numbers and calls from relatives of troops on the frontline for soldiers to be rotated, Ukraine faces a critical shortage of personnel as Russia gears up for an expected offensive in the coming weeks.\nWhile many had volunteered for Ukraine's war effort at the start of Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion, high losses as the war dragged on has led to around 650,000 military-aged Ukrainians fleeing the country, through bribes, illegal crossings or fake medical records, according to the BBC.\nLast August, Zelensky fired conscription officers who accepted bribes from those trying to avoid mobilization. The Ukrainian foreign ministry announced on April 24 it would suspend consular services to Ukrainian men overseas aged between 18 and 60 except for those returning. Kyiv has also banned the delivery of identification documents to Ukrainian men of military age abroad.\n",

Russia also attacked Ukraine with four surface-to-air guided missiles while drones attacked the eastern city of Kharkiv, damaging civilian infrastructure, Kyiv said.\nGerman company HENSOLDT will send six more TRML-4D radars to Ukraine to strengthen the country's air defense by the end of the year which the firm told Newsweek was part of a package of aid from Berlin worth over 100 million euros ($107 million).\nThe firm, which also supplies the German Armed Forces, said that the radars can detect and track drones, low-flying cruise missiles and aircraft, including helicopters, within a radius of up to 160 miles. \"Our radars are urgently needed by the Ukrainian air defense,\" said HENSOLDT CEO Oliver Dörre in a statement.\nIt comes as the German government has also said that it will send another Patriot air defense system to Ukraine as soon as possible. Newsweek has contacted the Ukrainian defense ministry for comment.\nAccording to German government figures, Berlin has sent eight TRML-4D radars to Ukraine so far, with another one being announced on April 29 as part of further military assistance.\nDespite the additional German assistance for Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has faced criticism for saying Berlin cannot supply the Taurus KEPD-350 missile, which Kyiv has long called for. Scholz has said its supply would draw Germany into the conflict and would require tactical assistance from Berlin that contravenes NATO members' efforts to contain the war in Ukraine.\nHowever, Berlin has remained a key ally for Ukraine against Russian aggression, having delivered or earmarked €28 billion ($30 billion) worth of military assistance to Ukraine, according to the latest German government figures.\nThe tranche announced this week includes at least 10 Marder combat vehicles, an air surveillance radar, as well as rounds of ammunition for Leopard 2 battle tanks.\nIt comes as Russian forces continue to build on momentum in the eastern front, following the capture of Avdiivka in the Donetsk oblast. Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) Deputy Chief Major General Vadym Skibitsky told The Economist that Russia is likely to launch an offensive at the end of May or the beginning of June.\nHe said Moscow is looking to take advantage of Ukraine's ongoing materiel and manpower shortages before an American military aid package just passed by U.S. Congress is set to arrive.\n",

The Capital International Airport is designed to ease congestion at Cairo's airports and serve as a new regional hub.\nThe Egypt International Olympic City, still in the planning stages, aims to host major international sports events with facilities like the New Administrative Capital Stadium, which will be the largest stadium in Egypt.\nThe NAC has yet to be given a formal name. A competition was launched on the new capital's website to choose a new name and logo for the city. No official results have yet been announced.\nSome government functions have already started the transition from Cairo to the NAC. Khaled Abbas, chairman of the Administrative Capital for Urban Development (ACUD), told CNN last month there are already 48,000 government employees working in the NAC, mostly commuting from greater Cairo via a new electric rail line. Officials hope to eventually centralize Cairo's government and business districts in the area, which will be run by a system of A.I.-powered technologies to optimize utilities, trash collection and the flow of traffic.\nThe NAC is gradually coming to life, with more than 1,500 families already relocated, according to Abbas. By the end of this year, he expects the number to rise to 10,000. The city is projected to house five million residents, taking some of the pressure off Cairo, the congested and polluted capital home to 22 million people.\nStill, there are concerns the NAC will not live up to its promise of being a livable option for vast swaths of Egyptians, with some Cairo residents telling Reuters they \"cannot afford to live in the new city.\" Egypt is notorious for developing new cities in its deserts, promising to alleviate the overcrowded capital. New Cairo, a satellite city established in 2000 was built to house as many as five million people. As of 2017, fewer than 300,000 people lived within its confines.\nEstimated to cost up to $60 billion over four phases of development — with much of the cost shouldered by the Egyptian military — some critics have questioned whether the NAC is an appropriate use of funds. Egypt is facing one of its worst financial crises in decades, and the economy is largely being held up by international loans.\nBut with phase one all but complete and construction on phase two scheduled to begin this year, the NAC is already further along than many of the world's other megaprojects. In Indonesia, where a similar development is in the process of creating an entirely new capital to replace the congested and sinking city of Jakarta, not a single building has yet to be competed despite a grand ribbon-cutting set for this summer.\n",

Ukraine also said it had taken out 31 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) putting the total number of destroyed drones at 9,611, only 389 short of the 10,000 mark.\nMeanwhile, Moscow's forces also lost another 27 armored fighting vehicles on Friday for a total of 14,156—less than 900 away from the 15,000 mark.\nBut Russian troop losses continue to mount up, with Kyiv's estimate of 1,260 casualties for Friday being the seventh consecutive day this figure had topped 1,000. That includes both those who are killed and injured and Kyiv says its estimate of both personnel and equipment losses are \"very approximate, and do not claim to be particularly accurate.\"\nNewsweek has contacted the Russian defense ministry for comment.\nGetting an accurate figure of Russian troop losses is difficult but French Foreign Minister Stéphane Séjourne said in an interview released on Friday that Paris estimates Russian casualties were 500,000, 150,000 of whom had been killed.\n\"What is all this for?\" he told independent Russian outlet, Novaya Gazeta Europa. \"In short, there is no need.\"\nRussia has not updated its tally of losses since September 2022 when Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said was just under 6,000.\nKyiv is often tight-lipped about its losses, although in a rare admission, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in February that 31,000 of his troops had been killed.\nHowever, Shoigu said on Friday that Ukraine's troop losses had surpassed 111,000, as he claimed that Russian forces \"continue breaking the enemy's system of strongholds along the entire line of contact.\"\nRussia's Defense Ministry said it has recently captured settlements around the town of Avdiivka, in the Donetsk oblast, which was seized in February.\nShoigu announced the capture of 211 square miles of territory so far this year. This was higher than the figure of 155 square miles he had announced in April.\nThe Institute for the Study of War estimates Russia controls around one fifth of Ukrainian territory, or more than 38,000 square miles.\nThe think tank has predicted that Russia will conduct a major offensive in the coming weeks as it seeks to capitalize on Ukraine's lack of ammunition as it eagerly awaits the delivery of U.S. military aid following a $61 billion package passed by U.S. Congress\n",

When shareholders of Digital World Acquisition Corp., an existing shell company, agreed to merge with TMTG earlier this year—clearing the way for the former president's company to go public—its stock value declined after an initial boost.\nWhen the merged group debuted on the stock market on March 26, under the ticker DJT, shares initially surged above $78, closing its first day of trading at $57.99 and giving the company a valuation of $11 billion. The value of each share in the merged group reached $71.90 on March 27, before its profit and loss figures were released.\nThen, the company's share value declined. On April 17, Google Finance data showed the value of each share at $22.84. That was the lowest the share price had been since January 16, exactly three months earlier, when it was $22.35, meaning the share price was a little more than before it merged with Trump's Truth Social.\nOn April 15, Trump filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) meaning that, pending the SEC's approval, some investors will be able to sell their shares, with one analyst suggesting people sell their stakes in the company.\nIn an apparent effort to avoid this, on April 29, TMTG issued a press release highlighting steps shareholders could take to prevent brokerage firms lending their shares for the purpose of short selling. The release also included a sample email shareholders could send to brokers to opt-out of securities lending programs.\nCompany CEO Devin Nunes, a former Republican congressman from California, also sent a letter to stock market index Nasdaq's chief, Adena Friedman, raising concerns about short selling.\n\"DJT appears on Nasdaq's 'Reg SHO threshold list,' which is indicative of unlawful trading activity,\" the letter, published in an SEC filing on Friday, said. \"This is particularly troubling given that 'naked' short selling often entails sophisticated market participants profiting at the expense of retail investors.\"\nNaked shorting is a form of investing in which shares being bet against are never secured or borrowed. It is banned because it can artificially distort market supply and incite volatility.\nSince then, the value of the shares increased somewhat and, according to April 29 Google Finance data, was up to $41.54 a share.\nOn May 3, the latest available Google Finance data shows it is $48.68 a share. It has been a week since the stock was worth less than $45, showing the company's approach appears to be working.\nHowever, Todd Landman, a professor of political science at the School of Politics and International Relations at the University of Nottingham in the U.K., said the stock was still \"volatile.\"\n\"The stock value remains relatively volatile with its surge to USD $66.22 at the end of March, after which it dropped to USD $22.84, but has seen a steady climb since 16 April back up to USD $48.68 by 2 May,\" he said. \"It has thus not recovered to the value in late March and there remains the key question as to whether Mr. Trump will sell his shares in September, which could affect the share price.\"\nA TMTG spokesperson told Newsweek: \"We will take whatever actions are necessary to prevent our retail investors from being exploited.\"\n",

He is regarded as one of the greatest military commanders in history, helping to expand Egypt's empire to its greatest extent thanks to a succession of victorious campaigns.\nIt is likely that the ancient building in Sinai was used as a royal rest house thanks to the architectural layout and the scarcity of pottery shards found inside, according to the MTA. The pharaoh himself may have used the facility during his military campaigns to expand the Egyptian empire to the east, researchers believe.\nThe building consists of two consecutive rectangular halls, accompanied by a number of rooms. It appears to have been fortified with a perimeter wall.\n\"This discovery is pivotal as it illuminates crucial aspects of Egypt's military history, particularly in the Sinai region, during the New Kingdom era,\" said Mohamed Ismail Khaled, Secretary-General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, as reported by Ahram Online.\nArchaeological work at the site also uncovered a number of burials, indicating that it was used as a cemetery during later periods in ancient Egyptian history.\nThe latest discovery is just one of many ancient finds reported from Egypt in recent months.\nFor example, archaeologists announced earlier this year that they had uncovered the missing upper part of a \"huge\" statue depicting an ancient Egyptian pharaoh.\nA joint Egyptian-American archaeological mission discovered the statue part during excavations conducted at the southern border of the Khemenu/Hermopolis Magna archaeological site, Yvona Trnka-Amrhein, one of the leaders of the project, previously told Newsweek.\nThe ancient city of Khemenu was a provincial capital since Egypt's Old Kingdom and developed into a major settlement during the Roman period.\nIn January, another team unearthed several ancient tombs with dozens of mummies—including some with golden tongues—at the ancient city of Oxyrhynchus, an extensive archaeological site located around 100 miles south-southwest of Cairo near the modern-day municipality of Al-Bahnasa in Minya Governorate.\nOxyrhynchus was \"very important\" during ancient Egypt's Greco-Roman period, which spanned hundreds of years from the late fourth century B.C. until the 7th century, Esther Pons Mellado and Maite Mascort, co-directors of a Spanish archaeological mission at the site, previously told Newsweek.\n\"[It] was the second city of Egypt after Alexandria.

        "content": "The U.S. is in the midst of a multistate outbreak of bird flu, with 1 in 5 commercial milk samples testing positive for genetic traces of the virus. But does the virus pose any threat to humans?\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza is an infectious viral illness that spreads primarily among wild and domestic birds. But the virus that causes bird flu can sometimes jump into animals, including dairy cows and, in some cases, humans.\n\"Bird flu, or avian influenza, infects more than 100 species of wild birds, especially migratory waterfowl,\" Carl Abraham, an assistant professor of medicine at the New York Institute of Technology, told Newsweek. \"In birds, it is highly contagious [and] causes a respiratory illness that is categorized as either highly pathogenic or low pathogenic.\n\"Pathogenicity relates to how sick the infected animal is, and highly pathogenic avian influenza [which is the form of the disease causing the current outbreak] has the ability to spread beyond the airways and lungs to infect multiple organs often resulting in death in birds within 48 hours.\"\nOver the last decade, bird flu cases in mammals have been on the rise.\n\"In most cases, mammal infection is thought to occur after the animal eats an infected bird,\" Abraham said.\n\"In 2024, the first reports of avian influenza (H5N1 strain) infected U.S. domesticated cattle that is possibly being transmitted cow-to-cow. This is now a multistate outbreak although the numbers of cattle infected in each state is small and the illness marked by transient reductions in milk production.\"\nDespite the relatively small number of infected cows, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has identified genetic traces of the virus in 1 in 5 commercial milk samples tested. The virus fragments are not actually capable of causing an infection—the process of pasteurization has seen to that—but the findings raise concerns about the risks associated with unpasteurized \"raw milks.\"\nIn a recent report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, researchers warned that such unpasteurized milk posed a significant for potential cross-species infections. In particular, the study focused on the risks to domestic cats, who have developed fatal infections after drinking unpasteurized milk from affected cows.\n\"Our findings support those of previous work that has shown domestic cats can be highly susceptible to HPAI A (H5N1) virus,\" the study's first author, Eric Burrough, a professor of veterinary medicine at Iowa State University, told Newsweek. \"Cats that have outdoor access should be monitored to avoid potential exposure to and consumption of dead wild birds.\"\n\"It is rare for avian influenza to infect humans,\" Abraham said. \"Two cases have been reported in the U.S., both in persons with significant exposure to infected mammals—most recently this year in a cattle worker in Texas who had conjunctivitis [pink eye] as the only symptom. Therefore, the risk of illness to humans is extremely low.\n\"Persons who own birds that come into contact with wild birds and cattle farmers are at most risk to come into contact with bird flu, but the risk of illness in those persons is still negligible.\"\nHowever, as we saw in 2020, viruses can evolve fast.\nRead more: Compare Top Health Savings Accounts\n\"Influenza has a complicated replication cycle within multiple species,\" Abraham said. \"This frequently causes the genes of different strains within a single host to mix, commonly referred to as recombination events.\n\"Most recombination events result in influenza viruses that are not able to replicate or replicate less efficiently. However, rare recombination events may increase illness severity, increase transmission, or even, as we are seeing with cattle this year, infection of new species. It is possible for a recombination event to give avian influenza the ability to infect humans.\n\"If the same virus caused human-to-human transmission, it could have pandemic potential. Again, this would be a rare event, but it is possible.\"\nWhile no significant threat has been identified for humans, Abraham added that studying viral transmission patterns like this could help predict and prevent future pandemics.\n\"The new information gained as we study viral outbreaks helps us to prepare for the next pandemic [not an \"if,\" but a \"when\" scenario],\" he said. \"Responses to outbreaks based on scientific evidence are most likely to result in the best public health outcome.

        "content": "An incredibly rare Roman-era object—made from a substance that was once worth more than its weight in gold—has been discovered at an archaeological site in the United Kingdom.\nThe item was unearthed during excavations conducted in 2023 by archaeologists and volunteers at the site of a Roman bathhouse located within the grounds of a sports club in the city of Carlisle, northern England.\nTesting of the lump—made from a soft, mysterious, purple substance—subsequently revealed that it contained beeswax and an element known as bromine. This is a strong indication that it represents a solid sample of Tyrian purple—a man-made pigment that was highly valued in the ancient world.\nThe dye, which is purple in color, is secreted by several species of predatory sea snails that are found in the Mediterranean region. Producing Tyrian purple was an extremely difficult task. The process was complex and required the collection of thousands of marine snails. In fact, it is estimated that it up to 12,000 individual mollusks would need to be processed to produce just 1 gram of dye.\nAs a result, it was extremely expensive during Roman times, to the extent that it was worth more than gold, pound-for-pound. The pigment was generally reserved for use by the upper echelons of society.\n\"For millennia, Tyrian purple was the world's most expensive and sought after color,\" Frank Giecco, an archaeologist with mining consultancy company Wardell Armstrong, which has been involved in excavations at the Carlisle site, said in a press release.\nFinding a solid sample, such as the one from Carlisle, is a particular unusual find, according to Giecco.\n\"It's the only example we know of in Northern Europe—possibly the only example of a solid sample of the pigment in the form of unused paint pigment anywhere in the Roman Empire,\" Giecco said in the release. \"Examples have been found of it in wall paintings (like in Pompeii) and also some high status painted coffins from the Roman province of Egypt.\"\nTyrian purple is thought to have first been manufactured in the 2nd millennium B.C. by the Phoenicians—an ancient civilization of the Mediterranean region that originated in the coastal Levant region, primarily in an area that is now occupied by modern Lebanon.\nThe purple pigment was most famously produced in Tyre—a city located in Lebanon that is one of the oldest continuously inhabited settlements in the world. However, it was also manufactured in other regions of the Mediterranean, such as North Africa.\nThe Tyrian purple sample from Carlisle was likely used for painting frescos, Sarah Irving, a spokesperson for Cumberland Council, which has partnered with Wardell Armstrong on the excavation project, told Newsweek.\nSometimes the pigment was used to paint walls in grand public buildings, as well as the homes and properties of the elite. However, it was also used to dye clothes.\nExcavations at the site of the Roman bathhouse have unearthed more than 2,800 significant finds to date, including hundreds of coins, carved gemstones and two monumental stone heads.\n\"Following the discovery of the two Roman monumental heads and the other precious items, the project is unearthing some fascinating and globally significant finds. More digs are planned, as well as the opportunity to visit the site and see the ground breaking work underway,\" Cumberland Council councilor Anne Quilter said in the press release.\nBritain was occupied by Rome from A.D. 43 to A.D. 410—with Carlisle located along Hadrian's Wall, which marked the boundary between the empire and the unconquered territories to the north.\n",

        "content": "Archaeologists investigating a submerged prehistoric settlement have found that it surprisingly managed to survive a period of climate instability that occurred around 8,200 years ago.\nThe village, dubbed Habonim North, now lies below the Mediterranean Sea off the Carmel Coast of Israel, at a depth of around 8 to 10 feet below the surface. Prior to the latest research, almost nothing was known about the settlement aside from its location.\nBut now a team of experts involving researchers from the University of California, San Diego, as well as the University of Haifa (UH) and Bar-Ilan University in Israel, have begun to unravel its secrets in a study published in the journal Antiquity.\nThe research included the first formal excavation of the submerged site, which was first discovered in the mid-2010s and later identified during a survey led by Ehud Arkin Shalev with UH—one of the authors of the study.\n\"The site was re-discovered during our team's surveys. At first, we thought it was a site related to a later archaeological period,\" Roey Nickelsberg, a Ph.D. candidate with UH's Department of Maritime Civilizations, who co-led the excavations, told Newsweek.\nHowever, after examining the finds, including organic remains that the team managed to radiocarbon date, the researchers determined that the site was occupied during the Early Pottery Neolithic period (around 6400–5500 B.C.) of the southern Levant, around the time of a phenomenon that scientists call the \"8.2 ka\" climatic event.\nNickelsberg said it was \"absolutely a surprise\" to find that Habonim North likely dated to this period.\n\"There are many submerged sites in this area but they are all from a later or earlier period,\" he said. \"And and on land there is very limited evidence for settlement during this period, so to identify an active permanent settlement was surprising and exciting.\"\nThe scarcity of contemporary sites in the region potentially reflects the impact of the 8.2ka event, which as the name suggests, took place around 8,200 years ago—or 6200 B.C. The event was characterized by a sudden drop in global temperatures that may have occurred over the space of just few decades. In total, the event may have lasted for roughly a couple of centuries, or more.\nDuring the event, the eastern Mediterranean region, where Israel lies, experienced increasingly arid conditions, effectively resulting in drought across many areas. This would likely have affected the farming communities that were beginning to emerge during this period.\n\"The impact could have been devastating on Neolithic farming communities,\"\nAssaf Yasur-Landau, head of the Recanati Institute for Maritime Studies at UH, who co-led the excavations at Habonim North, told Newsweek.\nPreviously, archaeologists believed that the climate event may have led to the widespread abandonment of coastal settlements in the southern Levant, such as Habonim North.\n\"During the time period related to the 8.2ka event, there seemed to have been no permanent coastal settlements, and, therefore, it was assumed that the coast was abandoned and then resettled later,\" Nickelsberg said.\nBut the latest study suggests that at least one village remained occupied throughout the period of climate instability.\nThe team's investigations at the site uncovered a variety of remains, including pottery shards, stone tools (such as ceremonial weapons and possible fishing net weights), animal and plant remains, and traces of architecture.\nThe researchers managed to date some of the organic remains using radiocarbon techniques, including those of wild and domesticated animals, as well as the charred seeds of plants. This work—alongside an analysis of the other remains—helped to date the site to the Early Pottery Neolithic, which coincided with the 8.2ka event, not to mention the emergence of pottery in the Levant region.\n\"It was only after our first excavation season when we analyzed the finds and applied radiocarbon dating to the site that we understood the site was in the ballpark of the 8.2ka climate event,\" Tom Levy, a co-author on the paper with the UC San Diego Center for Cyber-Archaeology and Sustainability at the Qualcomm Institute, told Newsweek.\nIt is unclear exactly how the prehistoric inhabitants of Habonim North survived, or even what impacts the 8.2ka event had on them. But the settlement—which had access to marine resources, as well as farmland for growing crops—provides some clues, displaying evidence of a diverse economy.\nThe ability to extract both marine resources (such as fish, shrimp, crab, lobster, clams, mussels, oysters, octopus) and land-based agricultural resources (for example, cereals, meat from wild game and domestic animals, as well as their secondary products, like milk) may have provided these early farmer-fishers with a \"flexible strategy to survive,\" Levy said.\nFurthermore, the inhabitants would have been able to store their surplus with the novel technology of pottery. There is even evidence that the settlement may have engaged in trade or exchange with other communities, which would have boosted its resilience by providing access to additional resource streams.\n\"In Habonim North we have an exciting window into life in a crucial period within the Neolithic—the beginning of the use of pottery,\" Yasur-Landau said. \"The ability to store goods in containers, as well as to cook and serve food in ceramic pots and bowls, changed society for millennia. It's astonishing that even in this very early stage, the pottery at the site came from different sources. It is possible that we have the beginning of trade in both vessels, as well as in agricultural products stored in vessels.\"\nThe results of the study indicate that at least some early Neolithic societies in the region were \"resilient and sustainable\" in the face of abrupt climatic changes, according to the researchers.\n",

        "content": "Having a gas stove in your home is bad for your health, researchers have found, and it could kill thousands of people across the country every year.\nPeople living in homes with a gas or propane stove breathe unhealthy amounts of nitrogen dioxide or NO₂, one of the pollutants from car exhaust, according to a paper in the online journal Science Advances. Long-term exposure to this NO₂ could trigger asthma in hundreds of thousands of people, as well as killing as many as 19,000 people annually.\nThis finding comes as the U.S. Department of Energy announced new energy-efficiency guidelines for gas and electric stoves earlier this year, which has brought a backlash.\nGas stoves work by burning gases, usually natural gas—a mixture of hydrocarbons but mostly methane—or propane. This burning can release byproducts, including harmful gases like carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides like NO₂.\nNO₂ primarily affects the respiratory system. It can cause or worsen respiratory diseases, particularly asthma, leading to symptoms like wheezing, coughing, colds, flu and bronchitis. Prolonged exposure can decrease lung function and increase the risk of respiratory infections.\nThere is also some evidence that NO₂ can exacerbate existing heart conditions, leading to increased hospital admissions and even premature death. Long-term exposure to NO₂ may also affect the development of the lungs in children.\nAround 38 percent of U.S. households have gas stoves, according to the federal Energy Information Administration, although certain states have much higher numbers of gas stoves than others.\nPollutant gases from gas and propane stoves may be responsible for as many as 200,000 current childhood asthma cases, 25 percent of which are due to NO₂ alone, the paper said.\n\"We found that just how much gas you burn in your stove is by far the biggest factor affecting how much you're exposed. And then, after that, do you have an effective range hood—and do you use it?\" said study co-author Yannai Kashtan, a Ph.D. student in Earth system science at Stanford University, in a statement.\nThe researchers also found that long-term exposure to the NO₂ in American households with gas stoves may lead to 40 percent as many deaths as those caused by secondhand smoke, which comes to around 19,000 people each year. This estimate doesn't even factor in the short bursts of NO₂ that are often seen in homes with gas stoves.\n\"I didn't expect to see pollutant concentrations breach health benchmarks in bedrooms within an hour of gas stove use and stay there for hours after the stove is turned off,\" study author Rob Jackson, a professor in Earth system science at Stanford, said in the statement. \"It's the whole family's problem.\"\nUsing a gas or propane stove in the home increases exposure to NO₂ by an estimated 4 parts per billion on average during a year, which is about three-quarters of the way toward the NO₂ exposure level classified as unsafe in outdoor air by the World Health Organization.\n\"That's excluding all outdoor sources combined, so it makes it much more likely you're going to exceed the limit,\" said Kashtan.\nThe paper also reveals that smaller homes are more at risk of these effects, with people in small two-bed apartments being exposed to around twice as much NO₂ as the national average and four times that of people living in homes over 3,000 square feet.\n\"Electric stoves emit no nitrogen dioxide or benzene. If you own a gas or propane stove, you need to reduce pollutant exposures using ventilation,\" Jackson said.\nThe effect of home sizes means that there is a major trend in NO₂ exposure among those with low incomes as well as racial and ethnic groups. The paper found that American Indian and Alaska Native households had a 60 percent higher exposure to NO₂ than average, while Black and Hispanic or Latino households had a 20 percent higher exposure than average. This also is compounded by the fact that these communities may be exposed to higher levels of NO₂ from other sources, including vehicle exhaust.\n\"People in poorer communities can't always afford to change their appliances, or perhaps they rent and can't replace appliances because they don't own them,\" Jackson said. \"People in smaller homes are also breathing more pollution for the same stove use.\"\n",

        "content": "Following the Miami Sprint race, FIA stewards have proposed a review of penalty systems for repeat offenses. This development followed a series of penalties issued to Haas driver Kevin Magnussen for multiple track excursions while battling with Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton.\nDuring the recent Miami Sprint, an intense on-track battle between Kevin Magnussen and Lewis Hamilton caught the attention of the FIA stewards. Magnussen, who was penalized three times for leaving the track, has now become the focal point in a broader discussion about the adequacy of current penalty regulations concerning repeated infringements.\nKevin Magnussen, in his post-race comments to Sky Sports F1, acknowledged the fairness of the penalties assessed against him. He explained his race tactics, which were primarily designed to assist his teammate, Nico Hulkenberg. He explained:\n\"All the penalties were well deserved - no doubt about it. I was in a very good position behind Nico there. In the beginning of the race, I gained a lot of positions and was up in P8. I was protecting well from Lewis because I had the DRS from Nico and I had good pace.\n\"Then Nico cut the chicane and I lost the DRS. Nico could have given that back to give me the DRS to protect because then we would have easily been P7 and P8. Instead, I was really vulnerable to Lewis. Started fighting with him like crazy and I had to just create the gap like I did in Jeddah.\n\"I started using these stupid tactics which I don't like doing, but at the end of the day I did my job as a team player and Nico scored his points because I got that gap for him so Lewis and Tsunoda couldn't catch him.\n\"Not the way I like to go racing at all, but it was what I had to do today.\"\nThe stewards, upon reviewing the incidents, cleared Magnussen of any unsportsmanlike behavior and recognized his acceptance of the standard penalties. The stewards' report highlighted as quoted by Motorsport Week:\n\"The driver candidly explained that he thought that he was entitled to race with Car 44 in the manner that he did and also that he was willing to accept what he considered to be standard penalties that would have been imposed on him for any infringements that occurred while he was battling for position.\n\"He was also of the view that building a gap between himself and the cars ahead was perfectly within the regulations and it was not uncommon for a driver to seek to assist his team-mate in the course of a race by doing so.\n\"He did not at any point in time think that what he was doing was wrong or that it was in any way unsportsmanlike.\"\nIn light of these events, the stewards have suggested a review of the penalty system for repeat offenses, signaling a potential shift in how future races might be regulated. They noted the necessity of enhancing penalties to deter drivers from repeatedly leaving the track, thereby maintaining the integrity of the sport.\nThe report from the Stewards continued:\n\"Moving forward, the Stewards will need to consider if, in appropriate situations, especially in the case of repeat infringements, the penalties to be applied for each infringement need to be increased to discourage scenarios such as those that we found today.\n\"This is something that we will raise explicitly with the FIA and the Stewarding team.\"\n",

San Francisco has been so close to getting itself back to the mountaintop, only to see everything crumble right before its eyes.\nThe 49ers changed quarterbacks and brought in more offensive weapons to counter the Chiefs, only for the same result to occur as did during their prior Super Bowl encounter. The 49ers' front office has taken a long look at where else the team could tweak its roster, bringing about rumors of San Francisco moving off one or both of its two-star wide receivers. Both Deebo Samuel and Brandon Aiyuk are looking for massive contract extensions, something that the 49ers will need to address at some point.\nWhile trade rumors swirled, 49ers general manager John Lynch fueled the fire by drafting wide receiver Ricky Pearsall out of the University of Florida in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft.\nLynch appeared on ESPN's \"The Pat McAfee Show\" and addressed the rumors that the 49ers may be looking to move off one of, or even both, receivers this offseason.\n\"I love our roster,\" Lynch said. \"I love the way it's comprised. As I said, we were right there. And we got to find a way to get just a little bit better. And I'm doing everything in my power to keep our roster together and that's my goal.\"\nHere are three intriguing possible landing spots for either Samuel or Aiyuk, if the 49ers do move on from them:\n1. Pittsburgh Steelers\nIf there is any club that needs to land a big-time wide receiver, it's the Pittsburgh Steelers. After trading away Diontae Johnson this offseason, the Steelers are left relying on George Pickens to be their top option. They did draft Roman Wilson out of Michigan, but relying on a rookie can be tough.\nIf Pittsburgh were to land either Samuel or Aiyuk, it could be a game-changer within the AFC North. Landing either one of them could vault the Steelers toward the top of the division, and would give presumed starting quarterback Russell Wilson some talent to work with. Don't sleep on Pittsburgh being aggressive here after a great offseason so far.\n2. Buffalo Bills\nAfter trading away Stefon Diggs and letting Gabe Davis walk, the Bills find themselves in a precarious spot at the wide receiver position. While the team did draft Keon Johnson and sign Chase Claypool, Buffalo could use a star.\nSomeone like Samuel or Aiyuk would help this offense thrive and give quarterback Josh Allen a true No. 1 option to throw too. Buffalo has been aggressive in the past in making trades, so there is no reason to think they won't be here.\n3. Washington Commanders\nAfter drafting No. 2 overall pick Jayden Daniels, Washington needs to surround the exciting young quarterback with weapons to throw the ball too. While they have Terry McLaurin, they could use another star next to him. Either Samuel or Aiyuk would do wonders for this Commanders offense and the team has all their draft picks for the next few years.\nSan Francisco could easily recoup some draft capital here and use Pearsall to fill the void. Washington makes a lot of sense but the 49ers may want to push for a trade to an AFC squad instead.\n",

Ham was hired just two years ago and had taken the team to the Western Conference Finals a year ago, but in the world that is the Lakers, that isn't good enough. Los Angeles demands excellence from its team and coaching staff, something Ham couldn't live up to.\nHe came under fire this past season due to his inability to make in-game adjustments when needed. Ham also never took accountability for his mistakes, something that rubbed the players and organization the wrong way.\nLos Angeles will now be looking for their third head coaching hire since 2020 and they are hoping the third time is the charm. Los Angeles wants stability at the coaching position, but the club's inability to identify the right person for the job has been troubling.\nRumors have been flying about the potential of them going after Tyronn Lue if he is let go by the Los Angeles Clippers, but all signs point to the two sides staying together.\nIn fact, Lue mentioned that he hopes to stay with the Clippers for a long time. He has built up strong relationships with members of the Clippers' front office and would love to continue working alongside them, per Ohm Youngmisuk and Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN:\nLue likely staying with the Clippers would serve as a blow to the Lakers' plans. But even if Lue did want to join the Lakers, Los Angeles would need to give the Clippers some type of compensation, unless he was fired. Clippers owner Steve Ballmer isn't just going to hand Lue over to the inter-city rivals so a firing is unlikely.\nThe connection that Lue has with Lakers superstar LeBron James has made him their primary target. Lue led James' Cleveland Cavaliers clubs to three consecutive NBA Finals appearances from 2016-18, including a win in '16.\nBut Los Angeles will likely have to look elsewhere for its new head coach. Names such as Mike Budenholzer, Kenny Atkinson, and JJ Redick have surfaced for the Lakers, but they are expected to take their time executing interviews.\nThe hope for the Lakers is that they can find the right person to lead the ship forward, maximizing the potential of the roster that the front office puts together. James can become a free agent this summer as well, but all indications are that he will remain with the team for his final few years in the NBA. As it always is for the Lakers, it will be a drama-filled summer but one that could dictate how the next decade goes for this franchise.\n",

Once again, injuries were the narrative of their season but this time, the organization may have drastic changes coming. Stars Paul George and James Harden could both leave the team in free agency, even if reports say that the organization wants to keep them together.\nHarden is an actual free agent, with George needing to decline his player option to become one. Harden has become somewhat of a negative asset to his teams over the years, even if he put together a good showing with the Clippers this season.\nLos Angeles will need to decide if they want to commit long-term to this unit, which includes retaining Harden despite his poor playoff struggles again.\nIf Harden does leave the Clippers, there will be interested teams. Here are five potential landing spots for the former MVP this summer.\n1. Los Angeles Clippers\nIn most scenarios, Harden will end up back with the Clippers. However, nothing is a forgone conclusion within the NBA. But the veteran guard seemed happy to be in his hometown.\nHarden said after Game 6 that he wasn't sure what he would do regarding his contract. But he would probably prefer to stay with the Clippers if possible.\n\"I don't even know,\" Harden reflected postgame, per Ohm Youngmisuk of ESPN. Harden finished with 16 points, 13 assists and seven rebounds Friday but missed all six of his three-point attempts. \"You are asking a lot of questions that I don't have the answer to or haven't even thought about.\"\nHarden wasn't a full distraction for this Clippers team, something he has had issues with in the past. Unless something drastic happens, such as contract negotiations go south, expect Harden to be back with the Clippers next year.\n2. San Antonio Spurs\nThe Spurs were once a proud organization and the class of the NBA. But multiple poor seasons in a row have left them reeling and searching for any sign of hope. Landing the No. 1 pick in the 2023 NBA Draft last season has seemed to do the trick and Victor Wembanyama looks like the next NBA superstar.\nPairing Harden up with Wembanyama could be scary for the rest of the league. The pick-and-roll offense alone would be lethal, creating relevance for the Spurs once again. San Antonio may need to make some moves to open more cap space up to outright sign the former MVP or they could try to pull a sign-and-trade with the Clippers.\n3. Orlando Magic\nThe Magic are still in the playoffs, currently preparing to face off in a Game 7 against the Cleveland Cavaliers. But Orlando has grown up a lot this season. They still need a point guard to help run the offense and Harden could be the missing piece for them.\nPairing up with young sensation Paolo Banchero could be interesting, giving the Magic more credibility within the Eastern Conference. Orlando should have plenty of cap space to work with this summer, opening the door to them landing Harden without giving anything up.\n4. New Orleans Pelicans\nNew Orleans was swept out of the postseason by the Oklahoma City Thunder this season and changes are likely coming to them as well. The Pelicans could use a more true point guard to take guard CJ McCollum off the ball, potentially opening the door for Harden to come in.\nThe Pelicans would likely need to make a trade to land Harden so a sign-and-trade may be possible. In the event that George departs the Clippers, maybe they'll look to New Orleans for Brandon Ingram. A swap of Harden for Ingram, with some extra pieces included, could work out well for both sides.\nEvan Sidery of Forbes reported that New Orleans isn't likely to offer Ingram a contract extension and that they could move him this summer. Landing Harden would be a financial commitment for the Pelicans but not as much if they were to extend Ingram.\nNew Orleans would get a point guard who can facilitate the offense around Zion Williamson, and the Clippers would replace George with a younger, more lengthy forward. It could be a win-win for both sides if the normally disgruntled Harden has his eyes set on New Orleans.\n5. Houston Rockets\nJust last season, the Rockets were one of the top landing spots for Harden, but nothing ever materialized. Could Houston look to their former star to once again help lift them forward?\nIt's possible but unlikely. The biggest hurdle was Rockets head coach Ime Udoka not being too big of a fan of bringing Harden back.\n\"Nothing against James,\" Udoka told Zach Lowe of ESPN, \"but Fred is just a better fit. I coached James in Brooklyn. He's one of the smartest players I've ever been around. The words 'Ime doesn't want James' never came out of my mouth. It was, 'Let's look at the best fit.'\nThe Rockets have created a strong culture without him so going back to him could ruin that. Houston is never out of the running when it comes to Harden but it's the least likely from this list of teams.\n",

        "content": "Red Bull's Managing Director Oliver Mintzlaff has issued a stark warning to Mercedes' CEO Toto Wolff regarding his public overtures towards star driver Max Verstappen. The rebuke follows Wolff's comments admiring Verstappen amidst Mercedes' pursuit of replacing seven-time F1 champion Lewis Hamilton who is set to join Ferrari in 2025.\nMintzlaff, responding to Wolff's comments, firmly reestablished Verstappen's commitment to Red Bull. He articulated the importance of the Mercedes chief focusing on internal team challenges rather than eyeing talents contracted with rival teams.\n\"This is a decision that Max needs to take, but there is no team up and down the grid that wouldn't do handstands to have him in the car,\" Wolff had previously stated as quoted by ESPN, acknowledging the allure Verstappen holds across the Formula 1 grid. He added, touching on the difficulties that the team has faced with the ground-effect cars, \"I'd love to have him, but first we need to sort out our car. First, we owe it to George [Russell] and Lewis [Hamilton] to improve the car and give them equipment that is good before dreaming about the future next year.\"\nCountering this, Mintzlaff was explicit in his disapproval of Wolff's public courtship of Verstappen. \"I understand the pressure that Toto Wolff and perhaps other teams have after years of being behind, but I think Toto should concentrate on his challenges. He has enough of those,\" Mintzlaff expressed in an interview with Bild Am Sonntag, as quoted by Pit Pass. He underscored the disrespect perceived in discussing another team's key assets, stating, \"It also has something to do with respect. If I keep talking about the personnel of other teams, that's not right.\"\nMintzlaff also highlighted that Verstappen has not shown any desire to abandon his current team, reinforcing the strong relationship and trust built between him and Red Bull's leadership, including Christian Horner and Helmut Marko.\n\"Max still has a long-term contract here and hasn't said a word that he doesn't want to fulfil it,\" he said. \"I'm not at all worried that he's considering a move. Things just have to calm down again now. That's what Max wants, and that's what we want too.\n\"At least I can't think of any. Max wants the fastest car... we have this. Max wants to become world champion... with us, he has the best chances.\n\"Max is a loyal guy,\" he added. \"He knows that Christian Horner and Helmut Marko have always placed their trust in him. He appreciates that. In addition, Red Bull is simply a great brand that he can extremely identify with. So there are many reasons for staying, and none against.\"\nAdditionally, Mintzlaff addressed the shocking exit of Chief Technical Officer Adrian Newey, who will be leaving the team in 2025. He commented:\n\"Adrian has done great things here over the years and played a big part in us winning 13 world championship titles.\n\"It's obviously a shame that he's leaving us, but we discussed it in a very fair and respectful dialogue. What he leaves behind is not only a unique legacy but also a structure that he helped to build.\n\"Of course, we will miss him, also as a person, but tomorrow we will still know how to build a very fast Formula 1 car.\"\n",

        "content": "Many consequences of cyber breaches have been well-documented, including financial and reputational damage. Recent developments, however, show that another serious consequence stands to become top of mind for business leaders: legal action against both the management and members of the boards of directors of organizations that suffer cyber breaches.\nAccording to cybersecurity expert Joseph Steinberg, the SEC's recent charges against the chief information security officer (CISO) of SolarWinds, combined with its new cybersecurity disclosure rules, should leave no doubt in anyone's mind that the government is demanding companies to \"get their cybersecurity houses in order.\"\n\"In a worst-case scenario, a cyber breach could lead to criminal charges against people,\" Steinberg says. \"We are talking about not only financial penalties, but, under some circumstances, potential prison time.\"\nThe SEC's filing against the SolarWinds CISO is not the first instance in the United States of criminal charges being leveled against a cybersecurity professional. Steinberg points to the case of former Uber chief security officer (CSO) Joseph Sullivan, who, until his sentencing, faced potential prison time for his role in the attempted covering up of a 2016 data breach that exposed personal information for more than 50 million customers of the ride-hailing platform. According to an article in SC Media, the former Uber CSO was ultimately punished with a probation sentence, a fine and a requirement to perform community service \"tied to a cover-up of Uber's 2016 breach.\"\nHowever, the SEC's new disclosure rules and its charges against the SolarWinds CISO have potentially changed the equation for companies when it comes to cyber breaches, Steinberg explains. The federal government is taking cyber breaches seriously, and company leaders should heed the recent news as a warning.\n\"Essentially, the onus has shifted as to who is responsible,\" Steinberg says. \"Instead of viewing cyber incidents as something that happened to a company, as something that doesn't necessarily need to be explicitly explained in filings or revealed to the public, the new rules basically say that if an incident occurs, the company's management and board are responsible to ensure that they adequately explain to the world what happened.\"\nSteinberg stresses that being upfront with investors about material cyber risks is paramount. In short, investors need to know what a company is doing to address cyber threats, how it has historically handled any cyber incidents, what damages have occurred due to any past cyber incidents and what damages are at risk of happening due to potential future cyber incidents.\n\"Someone's decision to invest in a company can be dramatically impacted by information about cyber risks,\" Steinberg says, adding that by not being upfront about cyber risks and incidents, companies could be misleading the public — which can reasonably be considered akin to \"falsifying a financial statement.\"\nPer analysis by Thomson Reuters, it's \"not explicitly mandated\" in the SEC's new rules, but \"firms are expected to provide details on board proficiency in cybersecurity.\" The directive from the SEC makes it clear that public corporations have \"to describe the board of directors' oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats and management's role and expertise in assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats.\"\nTo comply with the SEC's new rules around cybersecurity, companies need board members with the right type of cybersecurity experience and skills, Steinberg says.\n\"Companies need people on their boards who can oversee the management of cyber risk, not people who are technically savvy but do not understand how to ensure that the business is properly managing cyber risk,\" he says. \"The board must oversee the management of cyber risk rather than seeking to perform or actively manage the job of the CISO.\"\nUnfortunately, many companies do not have board members with adequate, appropriate cyber expertise. Findings from 2023 research conducted by WSJ Pro revealed that the \"number of directors at S&P 500 companies who have cybersecurity experience has increased sharply since\" 2022; however, the \"amount of cybersecurity expertise on boards remains relatively low, at a time when boards are under increased scrutiny for security failings.\" Specifically, the research found that as of August 31, 2023, \"107 directors at 113 companies had professional experience in cybersecurity.\"\nBut Steinberg cautions against boards rushing the process of signing on people with cybersecurity expertise.\n\"One of the problems that many boards face is that they bring on people who aren't necessarily skilled at overseeing cybersecurity,\" Steinberg says. \"Just because someone is an excellent baseball player does not mean that he will make an excellent team manager, and just because someone is an excellent manager does not mean that he will make an excellent team CEO. The same is true when it comes to managing and overseeing cyber risk. Boards need the right combination of experience, skills and talent to properly handle cyber risk, as opposed to merely thinking they are handling it well.\"\nTo that end, Steinberg emphasizes that it is vital for companies to empower the right people to play the right roles when it comes to cybersecurity. Specifically, CISOs, CSOs and other cyber experts should manage cybersecurity and should ensure that the necessary parties perform what is needed in order to handle day-to-day tasks and to develop and implement broader strategies. Board members should oversee the party managing cybersecurity to make sure that the cybersecurity program provides the company with adequate protection (as agreed upon by the board) against cyber risk.\n\"One of the issues that I see develop on a regular basis is board members getting overly involved in what they think is the oversight of cyber risk—but is actually the management or performance of it,\" Steinberg says. \"In turn, they end up wasting time and energy discussing matters that should be left to the CISO.\"\nHe notes that when board members attempt to take cybersecurity fully under their control, it takes away their focus from other elements of the business—and can make a company more exposed than if the management of cyber risk was properly overseen by the right experts.\n\"Board members who do not understand their appropriate role in dealing with cybersecurity and cyber risk can end up interfering with the CISO or CSO's ability to do their job,\" Steinberg says. \"Additionally, the failure of board members to understand where they fall into a company's cybersecurity and cyber risk management efforts can cause the board as a whole to become distracted—and in turn, fail to address pressing matters across the business.\"\nUltimately, he says, those organizations that do not yet have cybersecurity expertise present on their boards should take action now.\n\"In the same way that you wouldn't have a board that lacks accounting and legal expertise, you shouldn't have a board without cybersecurity expertise,\" Steinberg says. \"For many companies, a cyber incident is more likely to pose serious danger than accounting or legal issues.\"\nIdeally, he says, companies should appoint people who are \"familiar with the management of information security and cybersecurity.\"\n\"To not have that level of expertise is like presenting financial documents to board members with little to no accounting knowledge,\" Steinberg says.\n",

Within these crucibles of creativity and scientific rigor, young minds are not just honed — they are transformed, contesting the orthodoxy that separates the intellectual from the intuitive. Both opportunities herald a paradigm shift in pedagogy, where students engage in entirely new dimensions of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) competitiveness.\nU.S. Drone Soccer is where technology and teamwork ascend to new heights, showcasing a sport redefined by innovation and strategic ingenuity. This competition goes far beyond the traditional confines of athletic endeavor, melding the physical with the intellectual, to craft an environment where students are not just athletes but innovators and strategists. The drone soccer ball, a symbol of technological accessibility and creativity, serves as a testament to the power of STEM education, remodeling students from passive learners into active makers and problem-solvers.\nU.S. Drone Soccer is a well-founded educational experience that challenges students to build, program, and pilot their drones. This hands-on approach not only cements theoretical knowledge but also imbues students with a sense of kinesthetic accomplishment and a drive to explore new technological frontiers. Through the meticulous construction and programming of drones, participants learn the criticality of every component, the value of persistence, and the joy of collective achievement.\nAs educators lead these young innovators through the intricacies of the assembly process and flight dynamics, they are nurturing a future workforce equipped with the skills necessary for the challenges of tomorrow. The U.S. Drone Soccer Association, now boasting over 200 programs nationwide, is working to satisfy the growing demand for immersive, technologically oriented education.\nFrom its inception in early 2020, sparked by the World Air Sports Federation's recognition of the untapped potential within the U.S. market, U.S. Drone Soccer has swiftly ascended from a nascent sport to a national phenomenon — with worldwide ambitions. The establishment of the U.S. Drone Soccer Association and the development of an FAI-compliant drone soccer ball assembly kit mark significant milestones in this journey.\nWith the success of the first-ever National Championship in 2023 and the remarkable triumph of the Sato Academy Red Dragons in international competition, U.S. Drone Soccer has proven its efficacy as a platform for global achievement. The anticipation for the 2024 National Championship, set against the backdrop of Virginia's technological landscape, hints at the burgeoning legacy of this pioneering sport.\nAs we pivot from aerial feats and teamwork epitomized by drone soccer, we turn our gaze to the ground, where another form of competition beckons.\nRobofest, emerging from the ingenuity of Lawrence Technological University, stands as a bastion of innovation and a celebration of the mind's limitless potential. This festival, a symphony of autonomous robotics, unfurls a canvas where students from diverse backgrounds converge to weave the threads of STEAM (STEM + Arts) and computer science into a tapestry of ingenuity and fun. Here, robots become more than metal and code; they are recast as vehicles of learning, embodiments of students' creativity and problem-solving prowess.\nThe historical evolution of Robofest is a narrative of continuous innovation and pedagogical refinement. Since its inception in the 1999-2000 academic year, the festival has been a cradle of self-directed learning, encouraging students to transcend the boundaries of fixed rules and venture into realms of unfettered creativity and innovation. The introduction of the exhibition category and the Unknown Mission Challenge exemplify Robofest's commitment to nurturing critical thinking and adaptability, empowering students to tackle unforeseen challenges with grace and ingenuity.\nAs Robofest evolved, it embraced the arts, merging technology with creativity in RoboParade and the Global Robotics Art Festival, and later, RoboArts. These events exemplify the fusion of engineering and artistry, highlighting the holistic nature of STEAM education and the importance of integrating diverse disciplines to foster well-rounded learning experiences.\nThe small team sizes at Robofest are not by mere chance but by design, ensuring that each participant engages deeply with the material and contributes meaningfully to their team's objectives. This philosophy has cultivated an environment where learning is intimate, collaborative, and profoundly impactful.\nFrom the Vision Centric Challenge, inspired by the DARPA Urban Challenge, to the foundational Robot Sumo and its evolved counterpart, BottleSumo, Robofest has continually expanded its horizons, offering myriad avenues for students to explore, learn, and grow. The WISER conference and collaboration with AccelerateKID stands as a testament to the community's dedication to advancing robotics education, providing a platform for sharing knowledge and fostering a global dialogue on the future of STEAM learning.\nThe journey of Robofest, marked by its adaptability, innovation, and commitment to education, mirrors the broader narrative of technology's role in shaping our future.

        "content": "Recent statistics pointing to employee training fatigue, particularly in the context of IT and security training, highlight a growing concern about the effectiveness of training programs and their ability to adequately engage employees. This is not only true among the general population of employees, but also among IT staff members. One study found that 25% of IT security professionals are seriously considering leaving their jobs — 24% are considering leaving the profession entirely.\nA related concern — especially as many organizations have transferred much of their learning and development (L&D) activities into the digital realm, is growing fatigue related to digital overload. This overload, along with a proliferation of communication channels, is leading to a drop in engagement with cybersecurity training — 45% say that this overload is reducing their ability to effectively identify and respond to cybersecurity threats.\nThat's a situation that organizations and their HR and L&D staff need to be aware of and take steps to address. Here are some ways you can improve your cybersecurity awareness training efforts to achieve better results.\nMost cybersecurity training — in fact, most corporate training, in general — tends to be all too painfully similar. The pandemic drove many training efforts online and there many stayed. There's a benefit in being able to access training on-demand, but there can be tedium too. While this mainstay format may be part of your training efforts, consider ways you might dare to be different when providing cybersecurity training.\nSuggestions:\n• Random, interactive polls in a competitive format with \"winners\" applauded and \"losers\" privately provided with personalized coaching.\n• Pop-up news notifications challenges. When a breach occurs at an organization like yours, push the news out to staff along with a challenge question. For instance: \"What steps could you personally take to help prevent something like this from happening at our office?\" Share the best responses at an all-hands meeting or in the company newsletter.\n• Provide training in tidbits. Arm managers and supervisors with brief key points or messages that can be shared in bite-sized pieces, quickly, during staff meetings.\n• User-generated content. Get employees involved by challenging them to create brief TikTok-like videos highlighting important cybersecurity points in a fun and entertaining way. Offer prizes for the best/most liked content.\nThere are a variety of ways that you can think creatively about how to deliver security awareness training. While traditional training may still be your mainstay, think of ways you could enliven it by adding some additional, innovative, and interactive training options.\nConsider how you might incorporate best practices into all your security awareness training efforts.\nRudimentary forms of training can be traced back to prehistoric times. Corporate training also has a long history. R. Hoe and Company is credited with offering the first form of workplace training back in 1872. You'd think we would have picked up some good best practices over the past 150 years. And we have.\n• Provide variety. Mix up your content delivery by incorporating a balance of lectures with interactive elements like quizzes, polls, group discussions, and simulations.\n• Incorporate gamification. People like competition. Augment training with competitions, leaderboards, rewards, and prizes.\n• Offer flexibility and variation. Employee learning preferences are varied; training offers should be, too.\n• Make it visually appealing — and modern. Today's employees are used to consuming information in highly visual, often entertaining formats — think YouTube and Instagram.\n• Make it relevant. Make sure it's clear to your employee learners why this information is important, and relevant, to them. Yes, it will benefit the organization. But what will they, personally, get out of it? Hint: employees have security-related concerns just like your organization does. How can this information help them protect their family data and devices?\n• Make it personalized. Don't create a one-size-fits-all training course because one size doesn't fit all. For instance, the information required by the IT staff will differ from that needed by employees in the marketing department. Don't force them to consume the same information.\n• Seek ongoing feedback from employees and managers to learn how training can be made more engaging and impactful. Do employees feel the training was relevant and enjoyable? Did they learn something? Are managers and supervisors seeing the information impacting behaviors?\n• Track progress continually — not just learner sentiment about the training but actual organizational impact. Has security awareness improved? Have incidents lessened or have reports increased? Have specific goals related to your cybersecurity awareness training and measure against those goals. Share results with employees, and thank them for their efforts in helping to achieve goals. Enlist their support to close identified gaps.\n• Commit to continuous improvement. Security awareness is a journey, not a destination. You will never achieve 100% success, but you can achieve incremental improvement over time.\nEmployee training fatigue is real. But it doesn't have to be a constraint on your training efforts. Think of ways you can approach training differently to better engage employees. What new methods and techniques will you implement to combat training fatigue?\n",

Click here for the full series page.\nWhen the iPhone came out in 2005, I wasn't among the first in line, but I did buy one. Two weeks later, surprised that my new device was doing exactly what it was designed to do—addicting me—I replaced it with a no-frills Nokia, which I used for the next thirteen years.\nThen, on January 15, 2018, I put my Nokia in a drawer forever. Why? Because I'm haunted by the image of myself looking at my phone to the exclusion of everything else around me. Mostly I remember resenting that a cartoonish cube of metal and glass had taken control of my life. The \"endless and proper work\" of paying attention is an essential part of the work I do. Why would I use something that compromised my ability to be great at my job?\nEven though I'm currently in my sixth year without a phone, I decided to reach out to Nir Eyal, named by The M.I.T. Technology Review as, \"The Prophet of Habit-Forming Technology,\" to try to get to the bottom of phone addiction and understand why we check our phones even though we haven't received any notifications.\nEyal is the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products and Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life, selling over 1 million copies in over 30 languages.\nThe conversation proved fascinating — despite our differences, I was amazed to find an astounding number of similarities. I also came away having learned a few tricks that I still use to this day.\nSay, for example, you're at a business dinner and one of the patrons is constantly looking down at their phone. Instead of ignoring them, Nir's strategy is to confront them with concern: ask them in a sincere way: \"I can see that you're on the phone a lot – is everything okay – is there anything I can do to help?\"\nAs we dug deeper towards the root question that inspired our sit down, Nir's explanations brought me back to my own decision to get rid of my phone. Our phones are a form of armor. A shield. A light saber. A one-handed defense against our own fear, anxiety, aloneness, self-consciousness, stillness, sadness, and insignificance. A notification means someone cares. It means that we're important.\nI get it.\nAnd yet, when I'm walking along the street and someone glued to his or her phone crashes into me, followed by a quick, rueful \"Sorry...\" I can't help feeling an irrational rage. \"Don't you understand what you're doing?\" I want to say. Is this really how you want to spend your one wild and precious life?\n",

Why do we procrastinate on taxes?\nWhether we like to admit it, we've all been there. Breaking up, fixing that dripping tap, learning that new skill — the list goes on. A friend of mine recently procrastinated on his health check, likely suspecting that the message he would receive wouldn't be rosy. According to a recent study, 20 to 25 percent of the adult population procrastinates regularly, while a staggering 70 to 95 percent of all students report procrastinating on academic tasks.\nAnd then there's that dreaded tax return hanging over our heads.\nSo I sat down with economist Richard Thaler — recipient of the 2017 Nobel Prize for his pioneering contributions to behavioral economics and best-selling author of the book, Nudge. Thaler's work fundamentally challenged the traditional economic assumption that individuals always act rationally, laying the groundwork for the concept of \"nudge theory.\" Since procrastination is itself irrational, Thaler seemed the perfect choice to help me get to the bottom of my quandary.\nFrom the onset, Thaler wasn't anything like what I was expecting from a Nobel laureate. Despite the seriousness of his work, I found Thaler fun and approachable. When I asked him about the Prize, he merely laughed and told me that he assumed the Nobel committee in Stockholm probably couldn't get hold of their first choice, so he got the call as a last minute stand-in. Despite his self-deprecatory nature, it didn't take more than a few minutes with Thaler to see his brilliant mind at work.\nBut back to taxes.\nDid you know that if you just inform the tax authorities that you'll be filing late, in most instances nothing will happen? But we choose instead to procrastinate, incurring penalties which could just as easily have been cleared up with a dose of candor and honesty!\nJoin my conversation with Richard Thaler where we cover everything from urinals, Richard's love affair with a sound button, and of course his take on why we procrastinate.\n",

        "content": "Newsweek's core mission is to provide our readers with a deep and nuanced understanding of the world around them. That means embracing a truly global perspective. We aim to transcend surface-level narratives, offering coverage that creates opportunities for true international dialogue.\nTo many, the 21st century is also known as the Asian Century. Asia will lead the world in this next phase of global economic growth. According to Goldman Sachs, by 2050, the world's GDP will be $227.9 trillion. Asia will represent the largest share of global GDP growth at $90.6 trillion, followed by the developed economies at $82.9 trillion and then the rest of the world.\nOur recent exclusive interviews with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, masterfully conducted by our team led by Global Editor-in-Chief Nancy Cooper, are the latest example of this commitment. In this context, I see our role at Newsweek as not merely passive observers but as active facilitators of meaningful dialogue around the future of Asia.\nAs an American who was born and lived the early part of my life in India, I have a nuanced perspective on India's challenges and aspirations. The country's relatively nascent sovereignty, having emerged only 75 years ago from centuries of colonial rule, is a testament to its resilience. The journey from its colonial past to a vibrant democracy is a narrative I hold close to my heart, and it drives my commitment to ensure that Newsweek covers India with the depth and nuance it deserves.\nCoverage of India by mainstream international media at times gravitates toward simplistic narratives that fail to capture the profound complexity and vibrant diversity of the world's most populous nation. Typically, the portrayal emphasizes either the booming IT and economic sectors or the persistent challenges such as poverty and social friction, leaving little room for the varied perspectives beyond and in between.\nSuch coverage can overlook the rich cultural tapestry, the internal innovations in various sectors, and the distinct political dynamics, all shaped by thousands of years of history, that today stand at the nexus of geopolitical change. The level of optimism and pride I'm seeing among Indians—friends, family, and colleagues—is truly inspiring and unlike anything I've experienced before. The global stage is set to witness a confident India, and if the Indian diaspora's contribution to the U.S., the UK, and elsewhere is a preview, the world stands to gain much from India's rising prominence.\nThat's why Newsweek's interview with Prime Minister Modi and the associated story was not just a recitation of current events: Our coverage delved into the complex dynamics of India's geopolitical relationships and their broader implications for global affairs.\nModi's remarks to Newsweek on the Indo-China border disputes and his call for urgent resolution resonated globally, sparking reactions from major geopolitical players, including a direct response from the Chinese government. The response was immediate and extensive, with major news outlets like Bloomberg and BBC amplifying the discussion. The reaction from China was particularly significant, and its Foreign Ministry spokesperson highlighted hopes for diplomatic progress. This international engagement underscores the relevance of Newsweek's efforts and reaffirms our role in fostering meaningful global dialogue.\nA few weeks after our interview with Prime Minister Modi, we met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo. There, too, we gained fresh insights into the thoughts of a significant national leader and his approach to his country's challenges and opportunities.\nThe interview explored the country's pressing need for stronger partnerships with the U.S. and other regional allies to address what he described as \"the most challenging and complex security environment since the end of World War II,\" a situation exacerbated by recent military activities by China and North Korea. Throughout the interview, he frequently emphasized the term \"peace,\" underscoring Japan's intent to be assertive yet remain a peace-loving nation, obeying international rules.\nIt's our view that building a successful digital media company with global relevance today involves understanding political, economic, and social dynamics and committing to comprehensive reporting that resonates at the global stage and captures the evolution of the global order. In that respect, our recent India and Japan coverage serves as a kind of blueprint for Newsweek's global future. The impact of our interviews with Prime Minister Modi and Prime Minister Kishida and the accompanying stories highlights the critical role of media in international relations and democracy, reinforcing our commitment to journalism that not only reports but also enlightens.\n",

        "content": "Today, news media faces a number of structural challenges: deepening polarization, diminishing trust and a stark decline in reader engagement.\nAt Newsweek, we've delved deeply into the forces driving us here. One way we're addressing these concerns is the Fairness Meter, which allows readers to hold us accountable by rating an article's fairness on a five-way scale. Our fairness meter can be found at the bottom of select articles across Newsweek's editorial content and will help maintain a high standard of integrity, transparency, and accountability.\nThe landscape of polarization and eroding trust\nMedia's increasing polarization owes much to the dominance of social media, but the challenges began even before that with the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987.\nThis policy, which mandated the inclusion of diverse viewpoints, once ensured a breadth of perspectives in broadcast journalism — a formal balance that lent fairness and credibility to the format. Its removal marked the first shift toward what we see today: more extreme and polarized media narratives. Gallup's polls from 2021 and 2022 show that only 34% of Americans trust mass media, with a pronounced partisan divide — 70% of Democrats versus a mere 14% of Republicans trust mass media outlets.\nThis erosion of trust in news media is not an isolated phenomenon. It's part of a broader moment in which public confidence in many institutions has been waning. In an age when misinformation can spread rapidly over social media, the role of responsible media in providing accurate and unbiased information has become more important than ever. We must do what we can to restore this trust, and it begins at the core of the news product.\nChanging dynamics of reader participation\nParallel to the issue of trust is the evolution of reader participation. The digital age has transformed how audiences interact with news content.\nPost-2016 trends indicate a decline in engagement with traditional news outlets, particularly among younger demographics. Young people increasingly bypass traditional news platforms, turning instead to social media feeds and other digital channels for their news and information.\nThis shift has significant implications for how news organizations engage with their audiences and maintain relevance in the digital era.\nThe Fairness Meter\nNewsweek's Fairness Meter is one of our responses. First, it represents a commitment to deepening trust and enhancing reader engagement by involving our audience in the direct evaluation of our content. Second, the tool redefines the more traditional comment-based systems, instead opting for a structured and consistent way for readers to express their views on the fairness of our articles, providing a concrete method for readers to help shape and sharpen our journalistic tenets.\nHere's some of what we've learned after placing the Fairness Meter on over 1,000 stories since it was activated in September 2023.\nThe aspirations of the Fairness Meter aim to go beyond just gauging perceptions of fairness. It's one step in the direction of restoring trust in the relationship between the public and the news media.\nRepatriating news engagement to the news property\nOver time, social media has usurped news organizations as the forum for discussion and debate of news and current events. One byproduct has been the formation of information echo chambers, which often come to confirm the existing biases of different groupings of users. Social platforms — with finely tuned algorithms designed to amplify engagement — frequently prioritize sensational and controversial content, perspectives and comments, fueling what could be referred to as \"enragement engagement.\"\nThis shift has effectively taken over much of the discourse that was once a feature of news platforms. The Fairness Meter is an initiative to bring back reader engagement to the news platform itself.\nThe end of the ivory tower: A call for public accountability\nThe modern media landscape needs a fundamental shift in how news outlets address reader perceptions and engagement. The era of the journalistic \"ivory tower\" — where media outlets operate in isolation from their audience — is over. Today's media must open itself up to public accountability. The Fairness Meter is one way of demonstrating this new approach, allowing readers to actively participate in shaping the stories our journalists report on.\nIgnoring the imperative for engagement and transparency comes with significant risks. The decline in public trust and reader engagement on news platforms is a clear signal. This growing distrust, exacerbated by digital echo chambers and social media-fueled confirmation biases, threatens the foundation of credible journalism.\nThe Fairness Meter is not merely a feedback tool; it fosters dialogue and understanding and demonstrates respect for our audience's intelligence, acknowledging their critical role in shaping the way that we in the media work.\nOriginally published on Poynter.org\n",

        "description": "In the annals of American broadcast journalism, the Fairness Doctrine stands as a testament to a time when balanced reporting was more than a noble pursuit; it was a mandated practice.",

        "content": "In the annals of American broadcast journalism, the Fairness Doctrine stands as a testament to a time when balanced reporting was more than a noble pursuit; it was a mandated practice.\nThe policy, established by the Federal Communications Commission in 1949, obligated broadcasters to present contrasting viewpoints on contentious public issues.\nThis era of regulated balance came to an end in 1987 when President Ronald Reagan's FCC decided that the increasing diversity of media outlets meant the doctrine was no longer required. This pivotal shift laid the groundwork for significant transformations in the media landscape.\nIn the post-Fairness Doctrine era, we have witnessed an unprecedented polarization of American media. Freed from the obligation to present differing perspectives, many media outlets have defaulted to presenting narratives through a singular ideological lens.\nThe end of the Fairness Doctrine isn't the sole cause of media polarization, of course. The advent of social media and the algorithm-driven delivery of news, coupled with business incentives that prioritize engagement over balance, have exacerbated the divide. The outrage economy is a self-perpetuating system.\nThese shifts have profoundly affected our democratic society. Public discourse, once anchored in a commonly accepted set of facts, has fractured into micro-environments, subsets and cohorts, each espousing its unique version of reality. This accelerates the erosion of civil dialogue, undermining a critical component of our democracy. In this polarized media landscape, trust in the so-called fourth estate has plummeted to an all-time low.\nSocial media platforms, with their indiscriminate blending of content from trusted news outlets and dubious blogs, have furthered this erosion.\nThe shift towards subscription-based business models is a double-edged sword. While it has provided a lifeline to many media organizations in the face of shrinking advertising revenues, it has also inadvertently deepened the echo chambers. By prioritizing content that affirms their subscribers' worldviews, media outlets perpetuate these bubbles. And with quality journalism often locked behind paywalls, the information divide grows wider, further threatening the democratic ideal of an informed citizenry.\nIn the face of these challenges, it's crucial to remember that the principles of the Fairness Doctrine, though no longer legally enforced, needn't be abandoned. Instead, we should strive to voluntarily integrate these principles into our journalistic practices. By emphasizing fairness, balance and a representation of diverse viewpoints in our reporting, we can begin to counteract the rampant polarization that currently plagues our media and, by extension, our public discourse.\nNavigating today's media landscape is challenging. It's shaped by a web of social, technological and economic factors that defy easy solutions. Meanwhile, the erosion of civil dialogue, the declining trust in media, and the fragmentation of our public discourse pose serious threats to our democracy.\nWe need to raise our journalistic standards. Both-sides-ism isn't fairness — it's a failure of critical thinking or intellectual honesty. Let's not be naive: There are people and interests who deliberately skew our public discourse through misdirection, false equivalence and outright lies. We must counter those pernicious efforts by demanding a commitment to good-faith debate, which will pay dividends in rebuilding the trust that across the spectrum of ideas.\nAdopting a voluntary commitment to the principles embodied in the Fairness Doctrine represents a step in the right direction. It signals our dedication to upholding the ethical tenets of journalism, our respect for diverse viewpoints and our unwavering commitment to nourishing an informed and balanced public discourse.\nWhen fairness is no longer a doctrine, it must become a practice. Our democracy, in its present state, urgently requires this shift. For the media industry, it's not just a question of ethical responsibility but an existential imperative. The very health of our democratic society might depend on it.\nOriginally published on Poynter.org\n",
