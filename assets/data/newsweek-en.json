        "content": "The first four months of 2024 have proven some of the most difficult in Ukraine's two years of full-scale war with Russia, and perhaps the most straining in a decade-long conflict with Moscow that erupted in 2014.\nKyiv's troops are on the back foot all along the front line, facing a reconstituted Russian military supported by an economy shifted onto a war footing with massive Chinese assistance. Ukraine's Western backers have been slow to provide weapons and hesitant to take the wider fight to Russia. Distracted and divided by a slew of elections, Ukraine's Western bloc is creaking.\nThis year is expected to be hard for Ukraine following its disappointing 2023 offensive, on which so much hope and so many resources were staked.\nKusti Salm, the permanent secretary at the Estonian Defense Ministry, told Newsweek \"2024 will be difficult\" in a December interview.\n\"They need to assume the defensive; they need to grind it out,\" he said of Ukrainian forces.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin's apparent plan to outlast his adversaries may be working. Or this year might yet prove to be Ukraine's dark night before the dawn.\nDuring a recent visit to Ukraine, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg urged allies to fulfill their military aid commitments to Kyiv and declared: \"It's not too late for Ukraine to prevail.\"\nRussia's grinding westward push is continuing all along the eastern front, with Moscow's troops straining at great cost to seize new territory in the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia regions. The total capture of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts has been a key Kremlin goal since it fomented rebellion in eastern Ukraine in 2014, and a decade on the ambition appears in reach.\nThe current plodding offensive is laying the groundwork for an expected fresh summer campaign. Among the potential targets of the new push are the Donetsk city of Chasiv Yar—which is already on the front line and may even fall before summer—and the Kharkiv city of Kupiansk, a vital gateway to Ukraine's second city of Kharkiv.\nThe Institute for the Study of War wrote this week that Russia's capture and stabilization of a salient northwest of Avdiivka \"presents the Russian command with a choice of either continuing to push west towards its reported operational objective in Pokrovsk or trying to drive northward to conduct possible complementary offensive operations with the Russian effort around Chasiv Yar.\"\nNewsweek has contacted the Russian Defense Ministry by email to request comment.\nChasiv Yar is only six miles east of Bakhmut, which has long been a hotspot on the Donetsk front, even after its fall to Russian forces in May 2023. Now abandoned by almost all of its prewar residents, the city was a vital staging point for Ukrainian forces and sits on a hill with commanding views over the surrounding area.\nIt is also a gateway to the cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, both strategic level objectives for Moscow's forces in their bid to capture all of the Donetsk region.\nKyiv focused significant resources in Chasiv Yar after Moscow fomented rebellion in the Donbas in 2014, making it home to an important military hospital and later the headquarters for the Joint Forces Operation against Russia and its local proxies.\nPokrovsk is around 26 miles northwest of Avdiivka at the junction of two major roads heading to the city of Donetsk and to Bakhmut, as well as a railway heading through Avdiivka. A successful drive all the way to Pokrovsk would expose the southern flanks of Chasiv Yar, Kramatorsk and Slovyansk.\nPavel Luzin, a Russian military analyst and visiting scholar at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, told Newsweek it is \"hard to say\" whether Moscow's forces will be able to scale up their current drive for a larger summer push.\n\"There are not too many resources for a bigger offensive,\" Luzin said. \"Also, almost all these expectations are inspired by Moscow itself.\n\"What we do see is that Russia was trying to surround a significant group of the Ukrainian forces in Avdiivka, exactly like in Ilovaisk in August 2014 and in Debaltsevo in February 2015, but was incapable of doing this. Perhaps, Russia will make another attempt in the same way, because it needs stronger positions in order to get a break in the war.\"\nThis break, Luzin added, would allow the Kremlin to rest and reinforce its mauled forces. Leaders in Kyiv have repeatedly warned that Moscow is only interested in a temporary ceasefire to this end, not in a lasting peace. Luzin concurred.\n\"They need a break, but they are not going to end the war,\" he said.\nPutin may hope to win space for a pause having won all of Donetsk and Luhansk, long at the center of his project to dismantle Ukrainian sovereignty.\n\"For today, they want to get at least Donetsk and Luhansk,\" Luzin said. \"The problem is that the Kremlin claims Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions as Russia territory as well.\"\nWhile Ukraine digs in, Kyiv will also be looking to disrupt Russian communications, logistics, and industry as much as possible. Long-range drone strikes on targets inside Russia have become commonplace, and Ukraine shows little sign of easing its attacks even in the face of American displeasure.\nThe arrival of the longest-range iteration of the American ATACMS—the MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System—will give Kyiv greater reach than ever before. The longest-range munition can hit targets out to 186 miles, almost double that of shorter range ATACMS munition first provided in late 2023. Among its possible targets is the logistically arterial and symbolically powerful Kerch Strait Bridge.\nBut as with all new weapons, Kyiv has a closing window in which to exploit the ATACMS.\n\"As we know, the Russians are able to adapt in a very short period of time,\" Ivan Stupak, a former officer in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and now an adviser to the Ukrainian parliament's national security, defense and intelligence committee, told Newsweek.\n\"I think we have up to two months to eliminate as many Russian war objects as is possible before the Russians will adapt,\" Stupak added.\nThis year may see a significant shift in air power, with Ukraine awaiting the delivery of dozens of American-made F-16 fighter jets. Kyiv has said the aircraft will boost its defense against cruise missiles and drones being launched at cities nationwide, and also give much needed relief for front line troops being bombarded by Russian airstrikes.\nMoscow's glide bombs have been pivotal in the first part of 2024, allowing its aircraft to drop massive munitions on Ukrainian positions from a relatively safe distance. F-16s will make front line areas more dangerous for Russian pilots, given Ukraine expects to be using air-to-air missiles with ranges of up to 310 miles.\nWhile Ukraine has been waiting for F-16s, Russia has been losing planes. Recent months have seen an uptick in reported Russian aircraft being downed, including far behind the front line. Those losses—and the subsequent added strain placed on surviving planes—may prove challenging for the Russian air force in the aerial battles to come.\nStill, leaders in Kyiv and some allies abroad have repeatedly warned that a drip-fed and small force of F-16s will do little to change the overall picture. It remains to be seen if Western powers can master the logistical and political challenges to deliver a large number of the jets in a manner that can give Ukraine a battlefield edge.\nBut the newly arriving aircraft will help bolster a Ukrainian air force whittled down by two years of war. Kyiv's pilots survived Russia's initial onslaught despite the vast numerical superiority of the invaders. Ukrainian airmen performed far beyond expectations, inflicting serious losses on their Russian counterparts and making large areas of Ukraine too dangerous for Moscow's aircraft.\nThe naval asymmetric cat-and-mouse game will likely continue. Kyiv's drones and cruise missiles have proven deeply problematic for the Black Sea Fleet. The force has adapted its tactics and defenses to some degree, but new iterations of Ukrainian long-range weapons will continue to pose a potent littoral threat.\nThat threat has already forced Moscow to withdraw its most high-value naval assets from occupied Crimea, the traditional home of the Black Sea Fleet and the nexus of power projection in the region and into the Mediterranean Sea. Kyiv is constantly developing its naval drones and is expected to continue strike efforts even deep into Russian waters.\nUkraine has no significant conventional navy of its own, though leaders in Kyiv have long been working with Western partners to secure new vessels, including armored riverine boats from the U.S.\nThese small ships will not be able to challenge the Black Sea Fleet, a job which will remain assigned to the asymmetric drone fleet that has proven so successful. Ukraine will spend the rest of 2024 hoping to twist the knife and exacerbate Russia's problems at sea.\n",

        "content": "Senator Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican, was confronted on Sunday morning about discussions he may have had this weekend with Donald Trump about the possibility of being the former president's running mate in this year's election.\nKristen Welker, host of NBC News' Meet the Press, pressed Scott several times about Saturday's donor event at Mar-a-Lago, which was expected to attract more than 400 donors and featured several of Trump's rumored vice-presidential picks.\n\"Did you discuss with the former president the possibility of being his running mate?\" Welker asked the senator on Sunday.\nScott, a Trump ally, then responded, \"No ma'am. What we talked this weekend about how bad the economy is for single parents like the one that raised me. We had a lot of conversations around the room about the importance of eliminating 'Bidenomics' and getting inflation back under 2 percent...We had no conversations about the VP pick to be honest with you, to be clear.\"\nAs Scott continued to talk about economic issues, Welker pressed the senator, twice, asking, \"Just to be very clear, it didn't come up at all? Do you think you're on the short list?\"\n\"I hope that the president will choose a person [as vice president] who helps the country unite and heal,\" Scott smiled as he replied. \"I certainly expect to have a decision from the president in the next 60 days or so. He didn't bring it up and I certainly didn't bring it up.\"\nThe senator added: \"I'm just excited that in this nation, a poor kid from South Carolina can rise to the level of being a United States senator. It just tells me that all things are possible for kids growing up in poverty today. Kids growing up today, listen to this show and know, all things are possible in your future.\"\nNewsweek reached out to the Trump campaign Sunday morning for comment. This story will be updated with any provided statements.\nAccording to a copy of this weekend's Republican National Committee (RNC) spring finance retreat program viewed by Reuters, Scott was joined by several other rumored vice-presidential picks.\nNorth Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and J.D. Vance of Ohio, and Representative Elise Stefanik of New York were all expected to attend the private event.\nNoem, however, has seen her chances of becoming Trump's running mate fall dramatically after reports of her shooting her \"untrainable\" dog emerged, according to an online prediction market.\nMost of this weekend's event was held at the Four Seasons hotel in Palm Beach while Trump hosted a fundraising lunch at his Mar-a-Lago estate on Saturday.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, was also scheduled to address the guests at Mar-a-Lago.\nThe donor event was also intended to help the Trump campaign shore up its finances.\nThe presumptive Republican 2024 presidential nominee is facing multiple legal challenges, including his high-profile hush money case involving adult film star Stormy Daniels. Trump has pleaded not guilty to charges that he attempted to influence the 2016 presidential election by reimbursing his lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen for payments to silence Daniels over an alleged 2006 affair she had with Trump. The former president has denied the affair ever took place.\nWith the trial in the case set to last around six weeks, the former president is racking up significant legal fees. He is also facing three other indictments and related trials that could take place this year, and has maintained his innocence in those cases as well.\nThe former president has been paying his lawyers using the Save America political action committee (PAC), which has spent more than $62 million on legal fees since January 2023, Bloomberg noted.\nTrump's campaign and the RNC said on Saturday in a statement that they raised more than $76 million in April, with over half of the contributions coming from small donors. Meanwhile, the former president's campaign and the RNC said early last month that it raised $65.6 million for March.\n",

Video from local news stations showed police in riot gear lined up on the campus on Saturday after protesters began erecting tents on Friday.\nOfficers in headgear and carrying shields began to clear the clear the encampment on Saturday afternoon. Videos on social media showed protesters were pushed to the ground, dragged by their arms and sprayed with chemical irritants.\nA spokesperson for the Virginia State Police told Newsweek that pepper spray was \"the only chemical aerosol\" deployed against protesters.\nUniversity President Jim Ryan said in a message to the school community that when Tim Longo, the chief of the university police department, approached the students \"reminding them once again of their university policy violations and pleading for a peaceful resolution,\" the request was ignored. Ryan said the university has a \"long-standing prohibition on erecting tents absent a permit.\"\nRyan said that \"when UPD's attempts to resolve the situation were met with physical confrontation and attempted assault, it became necessary to rely on assistance from the Virginia State Police.\"\nPolice \"declared an unlawful assembly, issued no-trespass orders to those who refused to disperse, and arrested those who continued to refuse dispersal,\" he added.\nRyan said he recognized that some would disagree with the decision to call in police, adding that the \"entire episode was upsetting, frightening and sad\" and \"an aberration.\"\nThe student protesters said that police had responded violently to a peaceful protest.\nOfficers \"brought these weapons to a peaceful encampment,\" the UVA Encampment for Gaza account wrote on X, formerly Twitter, alongside a photo of an officer carrying an assault-type rifle. \"They beat us. They maced us. They brutalized us.\"\nStudents for Justice in Palestine at the University of Virginia shared a video on Instagram showing state police pointing guns at protesters, noting that it came on the anniversary of the Kent State massacre—when the Ohio National Guard opened fire on unarmed college students during an anti-war protest at Kent State University in 1970, killing four and injuring nine.\nThey wrote that white nationalists and neo-Nazis who had marched on the university's campus in 2017 were not met with a similar police response.\n\"Dozens of riot police were deployed to a small Gaza solidarity encampment,\" the post's caption said. \"In 2017, hundreds of neo-Nazis and antisemites descended on UVA campus in a deadly convergence entitled 'Unite the Right,' where Heather Heyer was murdered. The fascists' only opponents were militant antifascists. Now, UVA admin is unleashing riot police on peaceful anti-genocide protesters.\"\nHeyer was killed and 19 others were injured when a car plowed into counter-protesters who had taken to the streets to decry the white nationalist rally.\nNewsweek has contacted UVA and Virginia State Police for comment via email.\nOthers also took to social media to condemn police for treating student protesters more harshly than those involved in the 2017 rally.\n\"Happening at UVA in Charlottesville, police in riot gear are moving in to arrest protesters,\" Alejandra Caraballo, a clinical instructor at the Harvard Law School's Cyberlaw Clinic, wrote on X alongside a video showing officers dragging a person away from the encampment. \"Remember when neo-Nazis openly chanted 'Jews will not replace us' and the police did nothing?\"\nJoshua P. Hill wrote: \"Seeing the outpouring of cops in Charlottesville when UVA students protest genocide vs. the absence of (uniformed) cops when Nazis rallied in Charlottesville for Unite the Right makes things very clear. This is who cops are. This is what the ruling class is.\"\nIn another post, Hill wrote: \"Never forget that Virginia cops did more to stop students protesting genocide in Charlottesville than they did to stop Nazis from marching and murdering in Charlottesville.\"\nMolly Conger wrote: \"This is the university of Virginia. they let Nazis march, but they won't let you protest genocide.\"\nSaturday's crackdown at UVA comes as students have been demonstrating on college campuses nationwide since the arrest of more than 100 protesters at Columbia University on April 18.\nStudents have erected tent encampments to call on their schools to stop doing business with Israel or companies they say are profiting from Israel's offensive in Gaza, which followed Hamas' attack on southern Israel on October 7.\nMilitants killed about 1,200 people and took roughly 250 hostages.

        "content": "A new poll spells potential trouble for former President Donald Trump as he stands trial in Manhattan in his criminal hush money case.\nTrump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, became the first former president in U.S. history to stand trial in a criminal case last month. Following an investigation by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office, Trump was indicted in March 2023 on 34 charges of allegedly falsifying business records relating to hush money payments that were made to adult film star Stormy Daniels during his 2016 presidential campaign. Daniels alleges she had an affair with Trump in 2006, which he has denied. The former president has pleaded not guilty to all charges and said the case against him is politically motivated.\nDespite Trump's legal troubles, which include three other criminal indictments—all of which he has pleaded not guilty to—it remains a tight race in the polls between the former president and his likely challenger in November, President Joe Biden, the Democratic incumbent.\nHowever, this can change if Trump is convicted. According to an ABC News/Ipsos poll produced by Langer Research Associates and conducted between April 25 to 30 that was published on Sunday, 80 percent of Trump's supporters said they will continue to stand by him if he was convicted of a felony in the hush money case. Meanwhile, 20 percent of his base would either reconsider their support (16 percent) or withdraw their support of Trump (4 percent).\nThe sample size of the subgroup of Trump supporters was 937 adults with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4. The national sample size of the poll was 2,260 adults and the margin of error for the full sample was 2 percentage points. Of the national sample size, 31 percent were Democrats, 29 percent were Republicans and 28 percent were independents.\nNewsweek reached out to Trump's and Biden's campaigns as well as political experts via email for comment.\nMeanwhile, results varied in a matchup between Trump and Biden, depending on how adults in the poll identified.\nJust looking at all adults surveyed, excluding people who said they wouldn't vote, 46 percent supported Trump while 44 percent supported Biden. However, Biden led Trump among registered and likely voters. A total of 46 percent of registered voters supported Biden while 45 percent supported Trump. Meanwhile, 49 percent of likely voters supported Biden while 45 percent supported Trump.\nWhile it is still unclear how much damage a felony conviction in any of the four criminal indictments can have on Trump's campaign, a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted from February 9 to 12 found that 55 percent of American adults would not vote for Trump if he was convicted of a felony. That number is 51 percent among Republicans.\nThe full sample size of that poll was 1,237 people, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.91. The sample size of Republicans was 502, with a margin of error of plus or minus 5.26 percentage points.\n",

        "content": "In April, the Biden Administration released new Title IX regulations scheduled to take effect in time for the upcoming 2024-2025 school year. Title IX is an over 50-year-old federal civil rights statute responsible for ensuring gender equality within educational settings that receive federal funding. Among other things, Title IX protects students against hostile environments, such as those arising out of campus-based sexual misconduct and anti-LGBTQ bias.\nSince 1974, the U.S. Department of Education has enforced Title IX regulations requiring federally funded educational institutions to provide \"prompt and equitable\" grievance proceedings to address complaints of sex discrimination, including those of sexual harassment and violence. These regulations originally lacked specificity, requiring the Department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) to issue guidance on what an appropriate grievance process should entail at the campus level.\nIn 2011 and 2014, among other things, President Barack Obama issued Title IX guidance requiring schools to specifically address campus sexual assaults rather than deferring these matters solely to law enforcement, and to do so within 60 days whenever possible. However, this guidance-based approach changed in 2017, when the Trump administration rescinded existing Title IX guidance to then amend the Title IX regulations for the first time in 2020.\nAs indicated in the Federal Register's regulatory comments, the Biden administration found Trump-era Title IX regulations were \"overly prescriptive\" regarding certain aspects of campus-based grievance proceedings. The Trump administration had done so intentionally to protect those accused of misconduct over those who were victimized by it. As examples, it heightened standards for issuing interim suspensions and finding sexual harassment charges, while imposing mandatory dismissals for off-campus sexual misconduct incidents and requiring live cross-examination during certain Title IX hearings.\nIt also removed any standard for the promptness requirement to leave schools without any guidance. These regulatory changes not only deterred students from making formal complaints, but also emboldened institutions to prolong grievance proceedings to exhaust and further deter students from accessing the Title IX process.\nAdvocates were frustrated with the Biden administration's year-long delay in issuing the new Title IX regulations, which have finally arrived to better protect students and are now facing legal scrutiny. While the Biden-era regulations balance due process for those accused of misconduct with the need to eradicate sex and gender-based discrimination, harassment, and violence within education, several Republican-led states have already filed lawsuits challenging the regulatory protections for LGBTQ students.\nThe outcome of these lawsuits will either help fuel or quell the ongoing \"culture wars\" within K-12 schools regarding the ability of minor students to freely express their chosen gender identity (as opposed to conforming to their assigned biological sex). On the horizon, the Biden administration will release more Title IX regulations addressing trans-athletes, which is a topic of ongoing controversy amongst policymakers.\nFor survivors of campus sexual misconduct, the new Title IX regulations undo some of the damage of the Trump-era rules by (1) ensuring former students and employees may file Title IX complaints when the accused is still at the educational institution, and allow such complaints to be made orally not just in writing, 34 C.F.R. § 106.2; (2) strongly endorsing the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard for adjudications unless the educational institution uses the heightened \"clear and convincing\" standard for all comparable misconduct proceedings, 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(h); (3) reminding institutions to issue sanctions for misconduct as well as remedies to the victim and other affected students to address resulting hostile environments on campus, 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(h)(3); and (4) clarifying that retaliation is another form of prohibited discrimination under Title IX to ensure the same procedures are followed by schools for such reports, 34 C.F.R. § 106.71. By undoing some of the barriers to justice established by the Trump-era rules, the new Title IX regulations rebalance Title IX to better advance victim protections and eliminate abuse.\nThe 2024 Title IX regulations are not likely to change the ongoing legal battles surrounding campus sexual misconduct or LGBTQ rights, but they will certainly help students equally access education in the interim, as our nation keeps working toward safer learning environments for all. The real question now is around how OCR will enforce the new regulations given the high volume of pending Title IX complaints under the Trump-era regulations and limited funding by Congress for such efforts. For those invested in safer schools, our next steps must be to call congressmembers to demand increased funding for Title IX enforcement to continue ensuring ongoing gender equality with federally funded educational settings into the future.\nLaura L.

        "content": "Title IX has helped make the United States home to some of the highest educated, most athletically dominant women on the planet. But that won't stop the Biden administration from destroying Title IX to appease the most radical members of its party.\nBefore the Biden administration announced its new rule, Title IX had one purpose: to ensure women and girls have equal access to publicly funded educational opportunities. It didn't matter if that education took place in an elementary classroom or an NCAA basketball court; the purpose of Title IX was to protect opportunities for women and girls to learn and grow in a safe environment.\nThe Biden administration, however, appears to think women have had enough success.\nUnder its new rule, President Biden's Department of Education has abandoned accepted ideas of sex and gender to single-handedly interpret Title IX as protecting students from discrimination based on \"gender identity.\" Schools must now allow students to participate in any \"activity consistent with their gender identity,\" as asserted by the students themselves, or risk facing a discrimination lawsuit.\nThis will open up schools to lawsuits if they forbid biological boys from using girls' restrooms or locker rooms. The same will be true for schools that ban biological boys from the girls' health or physical education classes.\nPut differently, Title IX will no longer protect women based on their immutable physical characteristics. Instead, activists can weaponize Title IX to force schools to prioritize the comfortable education of the boy with gender dysphoria above the academic and emotional well-being of the dozens of girls who would rather not share a locker room or learn about puberty alongside biological boys.\nPresident Biden's new rule defeats the purpose of Title IX. By interpreting Title IX to be about protecting \"gender identity\" instead of physical gender, President Biden will place countless women and girls in uncomfortable—or even unsafe—learning environments.\nThe Biden administration is unperturbed. It dismissed the concerns of parents who don't want their daughters to share a bathroom with a biological man by denying that the \"mere presence of a transgender person in a single-sex space compromises anyone's legitimate privacy interest.\"\nPut down the bong.\nIt may be President Biden's belief that little girls do not have a legitimate privacy interest in only sharing restrooms with other women and girls, but common sense and most Americans disagree.\nThe Biden administration's Title IX rule will also require language restrictions, mandated by the federal government, on any teacher who wishes to use grammatically correct pronouns. Under the new rule, any teacher who refers to a little boy as \"he\" instead of \"they\" in a way that the federal government finds objectively offensive will trigger a lawsuit for discrimination. Grammar teachers might as well cancel the lesson on pronouns now.\nI have empathy for the small percentage of young people who suffer from gender dysphoria. Those students deserve to receive a quality education, too. We cannot, however, prioritize the comfort of a small set of gender dysphoric students over the safety, education and opportunities of all women and girls.\nTitle IX has protected women and girls for more than 50 years. President Biden ought to hide his head in a bag if he allows his administration to destroy decades of progress for women by turning Title IX into a weapon that his party can use to tear apart schools that don't support these anti-women gender policies.\nJohn Kennedy is a U.S. Senator from Louisiana.\nThe views expressed in this article are the writer's own.\n",

Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nNewsweek has reached out to the Pentagon via email for additional information.\nUkraine debuted its ATACMS in October 2023 using a cluster variant of the missiles to strike two Russian military bases in Ukraine and damage a slew of helicopters.\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan said last month that President Joe Biden had secretly authorized a \"significant number of ATACMS missiles\" to Ukraine in February.\nReuters reported on Saturday that a U.S. official said Washington had quietly sent longer-range versions of ATACMS to Ukraine, which were used to strike Russian-controlled Crimea in mid-April. It was reported in mid-February that the U.S. favored sending longer-range ATACMS to Kyiv to enable strikes on the Russian-held Crimean peninsula. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine back in 2014.\nThey were part of a $300 million aid package announced in mid-March and they have already arrived in Ukraine for use within the country's borders, Sullivan said. \"We've already sent some, we will send more now that we have additional authority and money,\" he added.\nThe U.S. did not publicly announce the delivery of ATACMS because of a Ukrainian request for \"operational security,\" U.S. State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel said during a press briefing last month.\n\"Until recently, as we've said on many occasions, we were unable to provide these ATACMS because of readiness concerns,\" Sullivan told the media on April 24.\nThe Biden administration had been working \"behind the scenes\" to alleviate these concerns, Sullivan told reporters, adding: \"We now have a significant number of ATACMS coming off the production line and entering U.S. stocks.\"\nATACMS give Kyiv's troops the firepower to strike high-value Russian assets far behind the frontlines.

Last month, the head of the U.S.' European Command, General Christopher Cavoli, told U.S. lawmakers that Russia had lost around 10 percent of its aircraft fleet in the full-scale war which is in its third year.\nKyiv's air force is expected to have Western-provided F-16 fighter jets in the coming weeks, many months after the jets were originally pledged by a handful of Ukraine's backers. The jets, although not a gamechanger in small numbers, will help replenish aircraft losses with more advanced hardware.\nUkrainian air force spokesperson Illya Yevlash said the country's ground forces had targeted the Russian Su-25 jet. \"We see excellent work, including the work of small- and medium-range air-defense units that can effectively deal with various types of air targets, including aircraft,\" Yevlash said, according to Ukrainian media.\n\"I want to thank each warrior in our mobile firing groups, in the air force, in air-defense units of other types and branches of the military forces—all those who are protecting now and will continue to protect the Ukrainian skies from Russian terror,\" Zelensky added. \"It is important to be as attentive as possible these days.\"\nNewsweek has reached out to the Russian Defense Ministry for comment via email.\nAir defenses have long been a priority for Ukraine, key for fending off persistent attacks from Russia's larger and more advanced air force. Zelensky said on Saturday that Russia had fired eight missiles and \"almost 70\" guided aerial bombs along the border and the front line.\nIn recent weeks, Russian jets have launched guided aerial bombs from outside the reach of Ukraine's air defenses. Moscow has used modified Soviet-era \"dumb\" munitions, converted into precision-guided winged bombs, to devastate Kyiv's positions.\nUkraine has consistently lobbied for more Western-made air-defense systems, and the missiles to keep them firing, in the face of near-constant strikes. A recently-committed tranche of military aid from the U.S., that had spent months languishing in Congress, focused on Kyiv's air-defense needs, as well as refilling artillery ammunition stocks.\n",

Using this method, Russia's gains have been incremental but its forces have built on momentum following the capture of Avdiivka in the Donetsk oblast, albeit at a huge cost.\nAccording to Ukraine's latest figures released on Saturday, Russian forces suffered losses of more than 1,000 for the seventh day in a row, with the 1,260 casualties of both killed and wounded taking the war's total to 473,400.\nWhile an accurate count of Russian personnel losses is tricky to calculate, it is not far off the 465,000 estimate given on Saturday by the U.K. Ministry of Defense (MOD) which said casualties will increase again in May and June amid renewed offensive operations in the east of Ukraine. This follows \"a slight decrease in the pace of operations\" over the last two months, it added.\n\"It is likely that despite the extreme cost in life, Russia has fully adapted its military to attritional warfare which relies on mass over quality,\" the British officials said.\n\"This reliance on mass will almost certainly continue for the duration of the Ukraine war and have long-lasting effects on Russia's future army.\"\nNewsweek has contacted the Russian defense ministry for comment on the latest British daily assessment which tends to highlight Moscow's losses and Ukraine's gains.\nUkraine and the U.K.'s estimates of Russian casualties roughly chime with those given by France, whose foreign minister Stéphane Séjourne told independent outlet Novaya Gazyeta had reached 500,000, 150,000 of whom had been killed.\nRussia has not given any update to its tally of losses since it said in September 2022 that just under 6,000 troops had been killed.\nUkraine has not given an update of its losses since President Volodymyr Zelensky said in February that 31,000 of his troops had been killed. However, Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu said on Friday that Kyiv's troop losses had surpassed 111,000.\nMeanwhile, independent outlet Mediazona has been working with BBC News Russian service to compile the number of deaths of Russia's soldiers, drawing on publicly available information such as obituaries and online notices. Their latest figures revealed on April 26 that at least 51,679 Russian troops had been killed, although they emphasize the actual number of deaths was likely a lot higher.\n",

There were no fatalities, he said, adding that 30 homes and 10 cars were damaged, without offering any further information about the source of the blast.\nNewsweek has reached out to the Russian Defense Ministry for comment via email.\nRussian glide-bombs have rained down on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, in recent months. Across the front line, Moscow has used adapted Soviet-era bombs, fitting the munitions with guidance kits and wings, to strike targets.\nRussian jets fire the precision-guided bombs out of the range of Kyiv's air defenses, and they glide towards their target, often with devastating effect. Ukrainian officials in Kharkiv have reported several strikes, including those using guided aerial bombs, in recent days.\nLast month, footage appeared to show a 1,500-kilogram (3,300-pound) converted bomb landing on a Russian-controlled village in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, although the munition did not detonate. Separately in April, Russian independent media outlet Astra reported that Moscow had mistakenly dropped a Kh-59 missile on a village in the Belgorod region.\nIn January, Russia bombed the village of Petropavlovka, in the country's Voronezh region, by mistake. The defense ministry said at the time that there had been an \"abnormal discharge of aircraft ammunition\" over the village, state media reported. A few days later, a Moscow-installed official said one of its jets had accidentally dropped a FAB-250 bomb on Rubizhne, in Ukraine's annexed Luhansk region.\nIn April 2023, a Russian warplane accidentally bombed Belgorod, causing a huge crater and a large explosion in the city.\n",

In 2022, he signed up as an \"ambassador\" for Ukraine's United24 fundraising platform to bolster the country's \"Army of Drones\" program, while taking the opportunity to refer to Russia as the \"evil empire.\"\nPrior to the 2020 presidential election, Hamill compared Biden to Luke Skywalker, saying that \"the force is strong\" with the then-future president as he shared images of Biden spliced into Star Wars on X, then Twitter.\nFormer Trump campaign adviser Brad Parscale seemingly embraced the idea that Trump was part of the \"empire\" by comparing the Trump campaign to a Death Star, the gigantic weapon of mass destruction that appears in multiple Star Wars films.\nHamill has continued to regularly share pro-Biden and anti-Trump messages on X. This week, he has posted a series of political messages that appear to be in preparation for May 4—a special occasion for Star Wars fans who celebrate it as \"May the Fourth\" due to a resemblance to the film quote \"may the force be with you.\"\n\"May The First Not Quench Your Thirst For Biden's Re-election! #BidenHarris2024,\" Hamill posted on Wednesday.\n\"May The Second Biden Administration Be As Productive and Successful As The 1st,\" he continued on Thursday.\n\"May The Third Be Absurd That The Guy Who Tried To Steal A Fair Election Is Allowed To Run Again,\" reads Hamill's most recent post on Friday.\n",

        "content": "Melanie Lynskey has revealed her biggest \"challenge\" while filming Peacock's new historical drama The Tattooist of Auschwitz.\nThe Critics' Choice Award winner is known for playing complex female characters, such as Shauna in psychological horror Yellowjackets, or revolutionary leader Kathleen in zombie drama The Last of Us.\nHowever, Lynskey has taken on a tamer, but no less stimulating role in The Tattooist of Auschwitz. The 46 year old stars as Heather Morris, the author behind the book the six-episode series is based on.\n\"In a way, it's a relief to not be fighting zombies or eating anyone,\" Lynskey told Newsweek, referencing her recent TV roles. \"But you know it was hard in its own ways. It is its own kind of challenge.\"\nLynskey finds it \"fun\" to play complicated women, but the Emmy nominee said portraying a real person came with \"a lot of responsibility.\"\n\"I just [wanted] her to be happy,\" Lynskey said. \"I [wanted] her to feel represented, and feel like she was seeing herself without [me] doing an impersonation of her, which would be so weird.\"\nRead more: Best Affordable Streaming Services\nAlthough she described the process as a \"balancing act,\" Lynskey discovered she could relate to Morris's sudden success in midlife.\nThe Tattooist of Auschwitz was Morris's debut novel, based on her real-life conversations with Holocaust survivor Ludwig (Lale) Sokolov—portrayed by Oscar nominee Harvey Keitel and The Little Mermaid actor Jonah Hauer-King in the show.\nWhile tasked with tattooing identification numbers onto the arms of other prisoners, Sokolov fell in love with a woman named Gita (Anna Próchniak), with Morris documenting their years-long struggle to be together.\nThe 2018 novel became an international bestseller, with Lynskey following a similar career journey. She landed her first movie role aged 17, starring alongside Kate Winslet in Peter Jackson's 1994 drama Heavenly Creatures.\nHer performance was praised by critics, but while Winslet headed to Hollywood, Lynskey preferred low-budget indie projects. This ensured she produced work she was proud of, but meant that few people outside of the industry knew her name.\nMainstream film and TV shows often relegated Lynskey to small parts, such as Reese Witherspoon's childhood friend in Sweet Home Alabama or as Charlie Sheen's stalker neighbor Rose in the early 2000 sitcom Two and a Half Men.\nLynskey left the role after two seasons due to a fear of only being seen as the show's \"wacky neighbor,\" despite Rose being her steadiest acting job to date. At the time, her agent called her \"crazy\" for turning down a spot as a series regular.\nHowever, Yellowjackets changed the game, making Lynskey a bonafide star as well as critically acclaimed. Lynskey stars as the adult version of Shauna in the Showtime series, a Surburban mom who survived a plane crash as a teenager and spent a year-and-a-half stranded in the Canadian wilderness. Her portrayal has led to multiple awards nominations across the show's two seasons, including an Emmy, a Satellite Award and an Independent Spirit gong.\n\"There is something about having led a relatively private life and then suddenly being a lot more public,\" Lynskey said.\n\"I think Heather took to it a lot more easily than I did. I'm still quite shy and awkward. You know people sort of recognize me and I feel like I'm in trouble, but she's great with people.\"\nRead more: Earn Cash Back for Streaming Services\nThere is another benefit to playing Morris—the New Zealand native gets to use her real voice for the role.\n\"It's always nice to get to use my own accent,\" she said. \"She's from Te Awamutu, which is a town that I know. It's incredible.\"\nStream The Tattooist of Auschwitz on Peacock from May 2.\n",

        "content": "The portrait released by Kensington Palace to celebrate the ninth birthday of Princess Charlotte on Thursday, which was taken by Princess Kate, has raised eyebrows online; fans and critics have spotted a link it shares with the Mother's Day portrait that sparked a photo-editing scandal in March.\nThe princess' reworn raspberry cardigan for both images has prompted speculation among social-media users, with some questioning the motivation behind its inclusion. Newsweek approached Kensington Palace in London via email for comment.\nImages released by Kensington Palace have faced increased scrutiny following the Mother's Day scandal. Kate issued a public apology after traces of editing were identified in a portrait of herself and her three children taken by Prince William in Windsor, Berkshire, in England.\nThe photo was of particular importance as it was the first officially released of Kate since stepping out of the public eye to undergo abdominal surgery in January. She then said that at the time of the photo backlash she had been diagnosed with cancer and was undergoing a course of preventive chemotherapy.\nSince photo agencies issued \"kill\" notices to news agencies over the Mother's Day image, William and Kate have moved away from the traditional form of releasing royal celebration portraits to agencies ahead of events. For the birthday of Prince Louis and the couple's 13th wedding anniversary in April, images were released through the Wales' social-media channels. This was followed on May 2 by the birthday portrait of Princess Charlotte.\nIn the image, the princess is shown standing in an outdoor setting, smiling broadly and wearing a raspberry cardigan with denim skirt and blue blouse combination.\nFollowing the image's release, users on X (formerly Twitter) quickly highlighted that the cardigan, identified as being sourced from French fashion brand Cyrillus, was the same one that the princess was seen wearing in the controversial Mother's Day photo.\nThis sparked a wave of posts and speculation, ranging from claims that the image had been taken on the day of the Mother's Day image, despite reports saying it had been created in the days before its release, to fans suggesting Kate was \"trolling\" her critics with the reference.\nIn addition to Charlotte's cardigan, some users also highlighted that Prince Louis appeared to be wearing the same shirt he had done in the Mother's Day photo for his own birthday portrait released a month later.\n\"They must not have gotten any new clothes this year,\" wrote one X user, posting a photo highlighting the matches.\n\"Do these Royal children only own 1 set of clothes?\" posted another. \"Louis in the same shirt as the Mother's Day photo last week. Now, Charlotte in the same cardigan and ruffled neck shirt (albeit a \"different\" color shirt) as the Mother's Day photo. WHY does this keep happening?\"\nIn response, fans of the royal jumped to her defense. \"She is trolling the trolls and I'm here for it,\" wrote on user of Kate in a post with over 70,000 views.\n\"That Mother's Day photo controversy started with Charlotte's cardigan sleeve. Now Catherine is making a point that, this picture isn't altered. She's messing with all the doubting Thomas's [people questioning her] out there,\" wrote another. This is a reference to the fact that one of the editing traces spotted in the Mother's Day image occurred around Charlotte's sleeve.\nFollowing Kate's apology—issued a day after the Mother's Day photo was released, which said \"like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing\"—neither the princess nor Kensington Palace has directly addressed the photo or the scandal surrounding it.\nJames Crawford-Smith is Newsweek's royal reporter, based in London.

In the ensuing months of war, more than 34,500 people have died in Gaza and about 80 percent of the population has been displaced, according to the latest figures from the Associated Press.\nMorgan and his guests were talking about the pro-Palestinian protests at college campuses around the United States which have led to hundreds of arrests. Morgan spoke about Jewish students at the colleges who had allegedly been harassed by the protesters.\n\"All you wanna talk about is the Jewish students,\" West told Morgan, insisting he should focus on Israel's actions in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis it has caused. \"Then, in fact, you become an extension of propaganda, and that's why I call you a racist because it means then that Palestinian lives do not have the same value as an Israeli life.\"\nMorgan snapped, \"How dare you?\" to West, refuting his accusations of racism.\n\"How dare you call me a racist. What you don't know is before I did this debate, I did a long interview with one of the IDF spokesmen in which I went after him about their planned invasion of Rafah because I think it would be a catastrophic mistake. So don't call me a racist,\" Morgan said.\nFollowing another heated exchange, Morgan said, \"I believe Palestinian lives matter just as much as any other life and I've always said that,\" to which West replied, \"Does not manifest in your framing, brother. Does not manifest in your framing.\"\nMorgan added, \"Don't throw around the word 'racist' without any evidence to support the fact that I'm a racist.\"\n\"I've been hearing the evidence,\" West told him. \"It's not throwing around.

But it should be possible to believe that, and to condemn the horrifying terror attacks on Israel on Oct 7,\" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter, almost three weeks after Hamas' attack.\nHis coverage of the war has proved divisive, though.\n\"The person covering Palestine-Israel best is ... Piers Morgan?\" asked Aymann Ismail in a column for Slate.\n\"Morgan's approach seems simple enough: have on the program as many people from as wide an array of opinions as possible, and let them make their case to him on the air,\" wrote Ismail. \"He gives each guest a considerable amount of airtime too, some stretching beyond 30 minutes—which may not sound like a lot until you compare it to other segments on broadcast news, which rarely surpass a few minutes before moving on.\"\nIsmail continued: \"At a time when social media bubbles often exacerbate polarization and misinformation, Morgan's seemingly sincere commitment to fostering meaningful dialogue stands out.\"\nBut Mohamad Elmasry, a professor of Media Studies at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies does not agree.\n\"The British talk show host deserves credit for featuring pro-Palestinian voices, but interview successes are owed mostly to the talent of his guests refuting his Israeli talking points,\" he wrote for the Middle East Eye in November.\n\"It is probably true that he has given more space for Palestine supporters than anyone else in mainstream western media,\" Elmasry wrote, but \"Morgan has not been nearly as balanced or fair as he implies, however.\"\nElmasry argued that Morgan seemed more likely to push back on pro-Palestinian guests while giving \"softball\" questions to those who were pro-Israeli.\n",

I was flabbergasted.\nMy partner and I hadn't used birth control in years. Not because we were trying for a child, but because after years of being casual about birth control, we assumed he shot blanks. I guess the joke was on me.\nThat night, I met an old colleague, and we caught up. I was dying inside but couldn't—wouldn't—share. Not that he wouldn't have accepted me. I was just afraid. Prideful. In shock. In denial.\nI called my partner and told him. He asked how that happened. I said, \"Lack of birth control, bud.\" By this time, our union was just a shell game. Smoke and mirrors. A happy looking, successful, and beautiful couple turned into a sham.\nI recall praying. I recall crying. I recall the decision to call the clinic and make an appointment to terminate the pregnancy. I called my mom and gained her support. I distinctly remember it was my choice.\nI did not consult my partner on the topic at all. Some regrets live on, and some don't. This was one that didn't. I simply was not going to get myself into any situation that would force me to be dependent on or intertwined with him. I couldn't trust him with anything. I certainly could not depend on him to be a father, and I was not going to do it myself.\nAs I walked into the clinic in Dallas, they were holding an anti-abortion rally outside its doors. I saw them approaching the young, scared, soon-to-be mothers entering and engaging them in persuasive conversation.\nNot me. I stood tall, was dressed in business clothes, and walked through that crowd like I was going on a sales call. Confident, scared to the root of my soul, ashamed, assured my decision was accurate. I'm pretty certain none of them expected a 44-year-old client.\nOnce inside, I was at peace. The waiting room was full of such young, scared girls. Some sat with their boyfriends, others with mothers or sisters, and some alone, just like me. I realized as we sat there waiting for our names to be called that we all had such different paths and stories that had led us to the exact same point. I somehow found peace in that.\nMy name was called, and I slipped into my gown. All the nurses were so kind and gentle and soft-spoken. The furniture, beds, and clinic were threadbare and reminiscent of the 1950s. But to me, it felt like a comfortable old blanket. Like grandma's house. Not fancy, but spotless and full of love and peace. I felt comfortable, safe, and unjudged.\nThe realization of seeing the tiny heartbeat and having the nurse assure me that I was, in fact, six weeks along was surreal. I could identify the night of conception. Oddly, I recalled thinking at the time that we should have used birth control that night. I had let my guard down.\nNext, the doctor came in. He was in his sixties and looked like he was tired of fighting the daily fight to perform procedures that are firmly protected by our constitution in 2007. He asked me why I was thinking about an abortion.\nI explained that I did not have a partner who gave two cents about me, how much I loved my career, and how I could not afford to give my job up to raise this child. I told him I had three beautiful adult sons, and that I was done with the child-rearing time in my life. I told him I had based my decision on logic, knowledge, and not fear.\nWhile recuperating in this warm, dark, soft, music-playing wardroom, I felt at peace. Nestled into my blankies alone with my thoughts, I knew I had made the right decision. Six hours later, I got up, got dressed, and walked out the door into the same crowd I'd walked past seven hours earlier.\nThey now knew. I knew they knew. Again, I strode past them, head high, my eyes up, confident that I had taken control of the rights of women to own their own bodies. Even now, as I write this as a reborn Christian, I do not know if I would have made a different choice.\nThat was my path—the same path that led me to Christ and the same Christ-driven path I am on today. Judge me. Applaud me. Pray for me. Cry for me. The choice is yours—just as the choice was mine.\nI do not believe abortion is birth control to be abused, but it should be an option. I believe women take on 100 percent of the responsibility for carrying a child and 70-90 percent of the care. There are great fathers out there who break that mold, but holistically, I believe that it is the mothers who raise the babies a lot of the time.\nIt seems impossible to believe that male birth control pills have not been invented to share the responsibility, but they haven't. When we find ourselves pregnant, we must act fast and trust our instincts.\nI believe that if a woman is pregnant, she alone may choose her destiny. Roe vs. Wade was signed into place to protect women in need of medical choices. With it being revoked in a number of states, we are casting shame on women needlessly as they franticly search out council facilities to end pregnancies.\nI am not justifying murder, but I am not doomed to eternal damnation because I sought an abortion. As a Christian, I believe that all sins are heinous, and all sins can be erased with Christ's mercy. If He didn't die for all sins, then his sacrifice on the cross was futile.\nMotherhood is a destiny and an honor. I would advise women to prayerfully decide when it is their turn to be mothers and to prayerfully make their own decisions.\nJoanne Richardson is President of Gailwinds Group LLC.

        "content": "In the winter of 1969, during the frigid spring semester at the University of Minnesota, a coalition of Black students staged a sit-in protest at Morrill Hall, occupying the office of the bursar and records for almost twenty-four hours.\nLed by Afro-American Action Committee (AAAC) President Rosemary Freeman, a sophomore, and one of only eighty-seven Black students on a campus of 40,000, the organization had communicated their grievances and demands for institutional changes several times previously.\nFreeman was originally from Browning, Mississippi, an all-Black community created by a group of ex-slaves shortly after the Civil War. She first came to activism as a high school student working to register Black voters in the south under Martin Luther King Jr. She'd been previously jailed for her participation in voter registration and was therefore no stranger to contentious political situations.\nThe assassinations of Dr. King and then Robert Kennedy in 1968 intensified the AAAC's desire to call the university to action. Among other things, they wanted the institution to foster diversity on campus via scholarships for local Black high school students and the creation of an African American Studies department.\nUniversity of Minnesota President Malcolm Moos, previously radio silent in response to the committee's outreach, negotiated a common ground to end the protest by the deadline. And thanks to the action of the AAAC, an African American Studies department was created and the university opened its doors more readily to local Black talent.\nIn February 2019, the University's Department of African American and African Studies celebrated the fiftieth reunion of the protest with teach-ins at the student union, the first time for a public reckoning of the events of 1969.\nRosemary Freeman, along with John Wright, Horace Huntley, and Warren Tucker Jr., are rarely known. As the AAAC president and, as she tells it, the one who leveled the playing field between herself and President Moos by greeting him in his own office chair during negotiations, Freeman's involvement is often glossed over in the scant number of available retellings.\nWhen I started my doctoral work in the sociology department at the University of Minnesota almost exactly forty years after the Morrill Hall Takeover (as it has come to be known), I'd never heard the story, nor did I understand the legacy of Freeman's leadership.\nWhich stories get told impact who is able to feel empowered by them. The erasure of Black women's stories weakens our understanding and connection to the legacy of Black women's accomplishments and dims the possibility of our collective strength.\nFifteen years before the Morrill Hall Takeover, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), working with Black families around the country, brought local lawsuits against counties across the South after being blocked from enrolling their children, mostly Black girls, into segregated white schools, culminating in the landmark Supreme Court case that legalized educational desegregation.\nThe stories of coordinated legal action are rarely heard, silencing the voices of all those other families who sacrificed themselves for the integration fight but whose names are absent from historical narratives on the issue.\nBrown v. Board of Education has been watered down to focus on one little girl, Linda Brown, wiping away what was actually a long-term, strategic plan between the NAACP, more than a dozen families, and the students themselves. This organized erasure of complex political protests organized in Black communities maintains perceptions of our ineptness in political organizing.\nIt is not a coincidence that girls and women (often mothers and teachers) led the fight for school desegregation. Black girls learn early in life that they will be expected to be poised and strong-willed in the face of danger and degradation.\nThe girls on the front lines of desegregation were physically and psychologically attacked, ignored, or otherwise pushed to their limits at school. In response, their voices were their weapons.\nThey utilized silence when deliberately provoked and spoke up in classes where teachers ignored their signals to participate voluntarily. They endured, sure, but they also made waves.\nSo much of the work of political organizing and protest has been concentrated among Black girls, in schools. But to highlight our skills of organization and execution of activism is to magnify our strengths, so the strategy and forethought of Black activism must be repackaged as insignificant or nonexistent. I didn't know my own connections to the desegregation movement until recently, which is perhaps to say I didn't know my strength.\nThree years after the Brown v. Board of Education decision, The Little Rock Nine, nine Black students—six girls and three boys—enrolled at the all-white Little Rock Central High School just a few blocks from where my mother lived with her family in Arkansas.\nJust a toddler at the time, my mother and her siblings were often under the care of fifteen-year-old, Carlotta (Walls) LaNier, the youngest of the Little Rock Nine attempting to integrate the local high school and the first Black woman to graduate from Little Rock Central High School.\nCarlotta was my family's regular babysitter; she was also on the front lines of American desegregation. She, along with her eight classmates, withstood the racial slurs and threats of physical violence in the name of education. She also paid a heavy price.\nAfter her graduation, the Walls family was forced to relocate to Colorado to find work and avoid the backlash caused by Carlotta's participation in the equal education fight. Ms. LaNier was a woman I'd never heard directly linked to my family until recently, when I made the decision to uncover her story as a part of ours.\nHistory, as a discipline and a social construct, does not view women, especially Black women, as historical actors. Despite our accomplishments, what we do is not often chronicled as \"real\" history. This is as true at Vassar as at any other HWSCU. In 1969 and again in 1990, Black students protested on campus and occupied buildings to demand fair treatment and increased support structures for Black students.\nIn 1969, thirty-four Black women undergrads took over the main building in the early morning hours, a result of detailed tactical planning, which allowed them to take over the switchboard with relative ease. They remained for three days until then President Alan Simpson responded to their demands.\nIn February 1990, a group of Black students again staged a sit-in at the main building, this time to protest the hiring of Daniel Patrick Moynihan—a white Republican sociologist infamous for his racist theories about the status of Black communities—as a distinguished lecturer at the college.\nMoynihan quit his post as a result of the protests. Recollection of the events is captured in the Vassar Encyclopedia, but you won't hear discussions of their organization on campus or about the improvements made as a result of their efforts.\nThere aren't photos capturing their occupation of Main Hall hung alongside those pictures of almost two hundred years of white students that serve as a visual history of the place. There are no anniversary celebrations or well-kept archives of what these students were fighting against or what they achieved. Their stories are functionally lost from the general history of the college.\nBlack students continue standing on the front lines of protests against police brutality and racism on college campuses across the country. They are being jailed, threatened, and vilified but also ignored in favor of the mainstream appeal of white student activists when the topic is appropriately \"non-racial.\"\nOn college campuses, Black students are challenging their \"othered\" status in ways I never thought possible. Conservatives often perpetuate the false narrative that colleges are places where hyper-liberal professors hijack students' minds with impractical, politically correct ideals. In reality, my students, mostly Black women, come to me not initially looking to protest.\nThey want to belong, to be the proverbial Vassar girls their white counterparts are offered the chance to become. And they are frustrated that the promises of higher education don't seem to apply to them.\nWe are not so different, my students and me. Protest is a last resort, a desperate act from groups of people without access to conventional support, but also with limited information about the activism of their forbearers.\nThese Black women want an education free from all the trappings of white supremacy that limit their potential. I didn't protest when I probably should've. I didn't recognize my connections to Black women activists and disruptors of the past, but they were there to be heard. And so, I try to pass down these stories, as bits of wisdom from the ancestors, that I wish I'd had.\nThis is an adapted excerpt from Black Women, Ivory Tower: Revealing the Lies of White Supremacy in American Education (Broadleaf Books, 2024).

And since I wasn't allowed to go to college, I studied piano pedagogy textbooks on my own to learn how to be a better teacher.\nI became resourceful despite my restrictions, and that's how I eventually escaped and started my life over, as I've written about in my new book, Rift: A Memoir of Breaking Away from Christian Patriarchy.\nI thought I had left that oppressive world behind, but now, more than a decade later, I see the #tradwife trend on social media, and it's bringing everything back—the glorification of traditional gender roles that were never as shiny as they appear with photo filters and curated vintage clothing.\nScrolling through TikTok, I see videos of women in long floral dresses.

One thing is a constant: They are always at home.\nThese videos use the hashtag #tradwife, \"trad\" standing for \"traditional.\" And while this nickname is new, the content is not. In fact, it's deeply familiar to me as someone who was raised to become a traditional wife.\nBut the stay-at-home life is not as glamorous as it looks on TikTok and Instagram.\nBack in the 1990s and early 2000s, when I was being homeschooled and taught the beliefs of \"biblical patriarchy,\" we didn't have the term \"tradwife,\" and I likely wouldn't have been allowed to watch TikTok videos anyway.\n\"Traditional marriage,\" \"biblical womanhood,\" and \"Quiverfull\" were the terms we most often used to describe our lifestyle, which was founded on Christian fundamentalism.\nChristian or biblical patriarchy is an ideology and religious movement centered around the idea that God is masculine, the ultimate patriarch, which is why men were \"created\" to be leaders in the home, church, and government.\nWomen were called to be homemakers, submitting to their fathers until they married, when they would then submit to their husbands. Men and women had to conform to strictly distinct gender roles.\nAs a homeschooled kid, I was taught many typical subjects, or at least given books about them, but my focus was to grow up and become a stay-at-home wife and mother. I became proficient in cooking, sewing, and cleaning.\nAnything I was taught was framed as something I could use to benefit my future family. Learning math was so that I could help my future husband do his taxes. Learning to play piano was so I could accompany hymn singing.\nI was allowed to skip science one year because it wasn't \"necessary.\"\nWhen I turned 18, I didn't go to college or get a job. I was called a \"stay-at-home daughter\" because I was in training to be a wife. My father told me that I didn't need an education or a career because it wouldn't help me in my calling and would tempt me away from God's righteous path.\nHomemaking was glorified as the ideal calling for women. Instead of video-sharing apps, we had Vision Forum catalogs where gender-specific toys were sold and glossy photographs of girls in frilly dresses and boys in Colonial hunting garb were shown to create an aesthetic of \"the good old days\" when men and women had separate gender roles. Books like So Much More and The Excellent Wife and magazines like Above Rubies and Patriarch extolled this lifestyle as one of beauty and divine purpose.\nSo watching #tradwife content is hauntingly familiar to me. These are not new ideas. It is the same old patriarchy wearing a different dress.\nJust like some of these creators say in their videos, I was also told this lifestyle was a choice, that I wasn't being forced into it. At the same time, I was restricted from outside information, prohibited from going to college, and not allowed to have a job outside the home.\nTheoretically, I could have moved out and chosen my own path, but as someone with limited life skills and insufficient finances, I had no idea how to actually do that when I turned 18.\nNot to mention that going against these gender restrictions would have been \"sinful\" and \"ungodly,\" marking me as an outsider to my family and church. So, even though I was \"choosing\" to be a stay-at-home daughter, I didn't really have any other option.\nToday, when I hear content creators sharing about how they choose to stay home and then say they submit to their husbands in the same video, I understand the dynamics at play behind the scenes.\nThe very concept of submission is that you are giving up your decision-making to someone else. If you \"choose\" to be a stay-at-home wife and give up all financial independence, you are placing yourself in a position where you won't have any choice in the future.\nThese videos are known for their ultra-feminine clothing and cozy cooking tutorials, but underlying many of them is a more disturbing ideology: That a woman is fulfilling her God-given purpose if she is a traditional wife who stays home and submits to her husband.\nAdding the promise of divine blessing to a lifestyle choice makes it more of a command than an act of true consent.\nOne #tradwife content creator named Estee recently shared a video of advice for high school girls who want to become traditional wives one day. \"Stay home as long as you possibly can,\" she says.\nShe goes even further by saying: \"If you want to be a traditional wife in the future, you don't need to go to college.\" In another video, Estee says women don't need prenups if they marry the right man because they can trust him not to betray the relationship. Instead, prayer is the best safeguard against divorce.\nAnother content creator named Jasmine Dinis says in one video that she is teaching her young daughter \"it's perfectly acceptable to depend on a man...that serving her husband and bearing children will be her greatest joy.\" Another video of hers proclaims, \"I used to be really into politics but now I just relax while my husband tells me what to think.\"\nThese words are so familiar that they trigger long-ago memories of being indoctrinated to believe that my only purpose was to be a wife and mother who didn't \"need\" a job or independent thoughts.\nAs I was in my twenties, unmarried and waiting for my father to help me find the perfect husband, I became deeply depressed and felt purposeless.\nServing men didn't bring me true happiness or fulfillment. I wanted to be my own person, but that would have gone directly against the mission to make me a submissive wife.\nAnd I had witnessed many women getting married and having extremely difficult lives as homemakers. They struggled with poverty, impossible expectations, domestic abuse, lack of bodily autonomy, burnout, and shame.\nAbove all, their lack of choice and true agency kept them trapped in unhealthy marriages.\nAnd while the #tradwife trend is fascinating to watch and even aesthetically pleasing for viewers who crave a slower lifestyle, it points to a deeper misogyny in our culture and a dangerous shift toward authoritarianism in American politics, one where women are encouraged to stay home, men are made to be the sole providers, and girls grow up believing they will be better off not having any real decision-making power in their lives.\nGirls like me.\nBut I know change is possible. I found a way to escape, and I will never willingly give up my agency for anyone.\nI'm sharing my story to prevent this kind of suffering in others because while being a stay-at-home [fill in the blank] is a valid choice for many, giving up your agency to submit to a spouse can lead to devastating consequences.\nWhen I tell girls they can be whoever they want, I'm really saying those words to myself, because after decades of being made to feel like I could only be a helpmate, I still need reminding that I have a voice.\nCait West is a writer and editor based in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

        "content": "I felt like I was on top of the world. I was married to my loving husband and together, we had an amazing 17-month-old son whom we both adored. My dream of having kids close in age was about to become a reality, and I was so excited to learn that I was pregnant with my second child.\nAfter my first healthy, stress-free pregnancy, I couldn't wait for my son to have a little sister or brother. My husband, Eli, jumped up and down with joy when we saw the pregnancy test was positive.\nIn the back of my head, I knew that miscarriage was a possibility, but I didn't believe it could happen to me.\nAnd then it did.\nWhen I was eight weeks pregnant, I had my first ultrasound. I was told that my baby had a strong heartbeat. I brought up that I had some light spotting, but the doctor told me not to worry.\n\"Don't worry,\" she said. \"That's normal. It happens.\"\nI breathed a sigh of relief, but I wasn't entirely convinced. My gut feeling turned out to be right.\nI lightly bled for two weeks straight. When the blood suddenly became darker and redder, I reached out to my doctor's office to make an appointment.\nI thought my concerns would be met with care and urgency from my medical team. Instead, I had almost entirely the opposite reaction from those whose help I desired most.\nInsensitive receptionists, limited doctor appointments, and entire days where none of the eight to 10 doctors in practice were in the office, were just a few of the unexpected and stressful challenges I dealt with. It all made my horrifying experience infinitely worse.\nI finally got a follow-up appointment, the morning my husband was leaving for a five-day work trip. He had attended every single doctor's appointment until then.\nI'll never forget the look of pity on the doctor's face as she told me the bad news. Despite having a beating heart, my baby was missing a brain, and I was likely going to miscarry. I would have to wait and see what my body decided to do with the defective fetus.\nEli's flight was delayed, so I was able to catch him before he departed. Eli couldn't even comprehend the news himself, as he was chaperoning his high school boys' softball team for a tournament and had absolutely nobody to speak to about his own sense of loss and the guilt of being away from his wife, who was suffering greatly.\nAs an Orthodox Jew, I faced another level of complication: my cramps worsened over the Sabbath when I couldn't use technology, including making phone calls.\nThere are exceptions if one's life is in danger, but while I was in a whole lot of pain I wasn't sure if it qualified as a life-threatening situation. I sought advice from my next-door neighbor, who threatened to call the doctor herself if I didn't.\nI'm really glad I opened up to someone with a more rational way thinking. It allowed me to remove the stress of wondering if there was anything else I should have been doing.\nWhen I woke up on the final day of my husband being away, I experienced the worst cramps yet. So when I saw a giant, fetus-sized clump of blood in the toilet, I froze completely and had no idea what to do.\nMy instinct was to cover it up as soon as possible. My hand shot out and I immediately flushed it. Not having Eli or someone else more rational than I at that moment was horrifying.\nOf course, this was also one of the days when no doctors were available because the office was moving. I sobbed to multiple receptionists for help, pleading for an ultrasound to see if my whole saga was over.\nBy a stroke of luck, my ultrasound technician happened to pass by one of the kinder receptionists and overheard that I was asking to see someone. She advocated for me and ordered me to come in right away. I am forever grateful to have had one medical angel who was concerned, and showed me the empathy I needed in that moment.\nWhen my husband came home, he was finally able to absorb all that happened and let out his emotions. We gave ourselves some time and grace to mourn the loss.\nI was ultimately able to get pregnant again. I gave birth to a healthy baby girl 10 months later, and one more daughter 5 years later.\nLooking back on my experience, I was surprised that the internet was lacking in relatable content about miscarriages. Other than a few articles and clinical websites, it had nothing that comforted me when I was up way too late in the middle of the night, searching for something, anything, that could tell me how I would survive losing my fetus, as well as so many of my hopes and dreams with it.\nI was under the false impression that people don't talk about miscarriages, since traditionally we don't talk about pregnancies until after the first trimester. I tried to be strong all by myself, but it became very clear I had no idea how to comprehend all of my emotions and physical pains.\nI didn't want any woman who had gone through a miscarriage to feel alone like I did. So I drew what I went through, creating a short comic about my story called, \"Miscarried.\" Actress, Mayim Bialik, also a mother, helped me launch the comic publicly and the feedback was incredible.\nI started getting emails from people all over the world who related to my story and were glad to find that they weren't in this alone. I ended up making a video out of my comic to reach more people. It's launching in May.\nAs awful as my experience was, I'm thankful that I was able to share it. While the world has certainly made some progress in discussing miscarriages and other complications regarding childbirth, there's still a long way to go.\nI hope that by telling my story through my comics, I can help others feel less alone in their struggle and help women understand that sometimes miscarriages, though terrible, can be a natural part of life, and that nothing is wrong with women who miscarry.\nIt's 2024. Nobody should be suffering alone. I want to make sure of that.\nChari Pere, creator of Miscarried: An Unspoken Cartoonmentary, worked as a creative director and illustrator/storyboard artist on projects for Red Bull, Jockey, Disney, Comedy Central, and Bud Light.

I was leaving a friend's house just after 11:00 p.m. and had only made it a few miles when a drunk person driving a truck crossed into my lane and crashed into me at 55 miles per hour, pushing my SUV off the road and into a ditch.\nI often think about what would have happened if I decided to stay longer or leave earlier. Would I still be where I am today? Would the driver crash into someone else instead? I've tried to let these questions go because I cannot change my circumstances and I would not wish that another person had been hurt instead of me.\nAfter the crash occurred, emergency services arrived at the scene and cut me out of my vehicle to put me in a helicopter where I was then taken to the nearest hospital.\nI do not remember much from the crash but I have been burdened with PTSD which makes driving and being a passenger extremely hard. I had various surgeries that repaired my ribs, legs, neck, and lungs. To this day, I still having chronic pain and stress from the events that occurred that day.\nThis whole experience has not only affected me, but those around me also. I may appear like most women my age, but I must face daily unnecessary struggles that I did not ask for. Due to the rate of speed and the type of impact caused, my body will never be the same.\nThe trauma surgeons saved my life that night by putting me back together with hardware in my neck, femur, tibia, foot, and ribs. The impact also caused one of my eyes to cross, which left me with a visual impairment.\nThe most severe injury I had was an Atlanto-occipital dislocation, which in basic terms is an internal decapitation where the skull separates from the spine. I still remember opening my eyes and feeling utter panic while in the hospital. With limited range of motion in my neck and shoulder, driving again was a challenge. I've had to depend on blind spot monitoring in my new vehicle as well as special mirrors.\nDriving while drunk is 100 percent preventable, with so much advancement in technology, people have options to get home safely and should be using them. I have learned from this tragedy that there are good people in life that want to help.\nI found a bigger purpose by sharing my story with MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) to help other survivors and Law Enforcement. There's a great reward for turning my pain into something that might help others. Lastly, I have learned to be grateful for the good days and allow myself grace when my body is in severe pain, when I can't do the things I want or need to do. I believe that we are connected through painful times and I've found ways to look for blessings in this burden.\nStephanie Ronan is an internal decapitation survivor.

I don't care.\"\nThe man, who is off-camera, said sarcastically: \"That's a good attitude,\" to which she replied: \"That's why I'm wearing it. But thanks for your input.\"\nThere has been a huge response to the video, which you can watch here, and Lora told Newsweek the interaction made her \"really angry.\"\n\"We'd just turned on the mic to do a sound check for some street interviews and then it happened,\" she said.\n\"It made me really angry as I was minding my own business and he just thought he could come and say that to me.

Nah. Love it.\" Another commented: \"Well said!\"\nBut some accused her of wanting \"attention\" or even faking the video, though Lora was quickly defended by other users in the comments.\nLora told Newsweek: \"I get a bit of hate on some of my videos as I do street interviews, so to get some support is really nice. We need to stick together and lift each other up rather than bring each other down.\"\nSharing some advice, she urged people to \"stay safe and always be careful.\"\n\"Keep your phones on you and make sure people know where you are if you're alone.

Since her video was posted on April 11, it has received 1.1 million views, over 111,000 likes and over 840 comments.\n\"There is nothing more superior than having your significant other leave in the morning before you, and you get to stay in bed,\" Napolitano said in the video. \"They're like, 'Bye,' and you just get to stay in bed. Like, why is that so superior? I feel like this is extremely toxic of me, but I love it.\"\nNapolitano told Newsweek that her work-from-home lifestyle allows her more time to relax in the mornings than her boyfriend, who exercises first thing—sometimes as early as 5 a.m.\n\"I love it,\" Napolitano said. \"I love seeing him push himself, and that he loves to just let me chill... I'm not a morning person, so I just love the few extra hours to lay in bed and relax before getting my day started.\"\nNapolitano said she has a constant appreciation for this set-up, especially since it hasn't always been the case: \"In previous relationships, I was the one getting up first and leaving to go to work, and I hated it,\" she added. \"I was out the door at 6 a.m. and he was in bed until 1 p.m., which made for a very difficult dynamic.\"\nWhen asked what she does on the weekends when nobody is determined to exercise at 5 a.m., Napolitano said she enjoys longer morning rituals with her boyfriend.\n\"My favorite morning rituals with my boyfriend are having coffee together and walking the dog together,\" she said. \"On the weekends, we do this and get a coffee outside with no phones, which I love. We always follow it up with a workout, either Pilates or a run.\"\nViewers in the comments could equally resonate with both the \"stay in bed girlfriend\" and the early-rising partner.\n\"Literally, getting to sprawl out and have the whole bed to yourself again is the best,\" @mackenzie.steen wrote.\n\"I go first and I'm mad about it every single day,\" @alyssasantostefano posted.\nHowever, some are saying life can get even better than Napolitano describes.\n\"Superior is when you have to leave first, but your boyfriend still wakes up with you and packs your lunch, and makes you coffee,\" @legal_marinara commented.\n",

The National Coffee Association reported in 2022 that Americans drank about 517 million cups of coffee daily, and the stimulating drink had become increasingly popular among people ages 18 to 24.\nOhlson said she felt like she had no choice but to eliminate caffeine from her diet after noticing several side effects, including eye twitches and gut problems.\n\"Since quitting caffeine, I wake up with more energy. I don't feel the need to drink a coffee first thing in the morning,\" Ohlson said. \"I feel more focused and at ease throughout the day.\"\n\"I had a constant eye twitch and always felt on edge,\" Ohlson said of the effects caffeine had on her. \"Along with anxiety, I noticed gut problems—even when hydrating and eating before consumption—inflammation and acne, and heightened premenstrual syndrome symptoms, such as mood swings, and cramps.\"\nShe added: \"I wanted to feel and look my healthiest. So I decided to see how I would feel without caffeine.\"\nAccording to Johns Hopkins Medicine, coffee has numerous advantages, including increasing vitality and preventing serious illnesses, such as Parkinson's and heart failure. However, it's not the greatest option for anxious individuals.\nAmy Baertschi, a registered dietitian, spoke with Newsweek about the links between coffee and anxiety.\n\"It's important to remember that caffeine is a central nervous stimulant and will raise heart rate, blood pressure, and may cause heart palpitations if consumed in higher doses,\" said Baertschi, who lives in Zurich.\nShe continued: \"For people with preexisting anxiety, adding something that will exacerbate the symptoms of anxiety (such as heart palpitations or increased heart rate) will only make symptoms worse.\"\nDuring the TikTok video, which has received more than 101,000 views and 12,000 likes, Ohlson said quitting caffeine \"cured\" her. She added that she was mentally in a better place and that her skin had \"never been this clear and this glowy.\"\nShe told Newsweek: \"I am a beverage girl. I love waking up and drinking a coffee or juice. The hardest part of giving up caffeine was losing the ritual of it.\"\nAccording to the CDC, three to five cups of plain coffee is OK as part of a healthy diet. Ohlson said she replaced coffee with water that contained electrolytes—though she hasn't ruled out the odd latte as a \"treat.\"\nShe said: \"I also remind myself that everything in moderation is important. I still love coffee, so I opt for decaf when I am craving one. However, I have treated myself to two lattes since March.\n\"Overall, my mental health has been better, and I no longer struggle with horrible anxiety. Of course, I have my day, but when I am anxious, I feel like I have more control and can deal with it a lot easier.\"\nIn the video's comments section, TikTok users shared their experiences quitting caffeine or moderating their intake.\n\"I stopped drinking caffeine on an empty stomach (I knew it was bad for me) and omg my anxiety lessened SO MUCH,\" one user wrote.\n\"Ughhh I'm moody without caffeine I want to but I can't,\" another added.\nA commenter said: \"I did the same thing!!!

        "content": "A mom has shared footage of her 5-year-old son eating a chicken nugget for the first time, saying it represents a significant breakthrough for her family.\nFor most families, a trip to Chick-fil-A is nothing to write home about. But it's different for Emily Marie Losier and son Dax, who live in Pennsylvania. Dax has autism spectrum disorder and struggles with what his mom terms \"extreme food aversion.\"\n\"Dax has a very sensitive gag reflex,\" Losier told Newsweek. \"So if he has it in his mind that he doesn't like something, no matter how it tastes, he will just throw up. I learned that lesson by trying to 'make' him taste something one time and one time only.\"\nLosier said Dax first started to refuse certain foods when he was 2. \"He would literally cover his hand with his mouth and from food he didn't want to try,\" she said. Instead, he insists on eating only what he considers \"comfortable, safe food.\"\n\"He absolutely loves spaghetti,\" Losier said. \"He would live on it. The only way I can get him to eat meat is ground beef in spaghetti sauce or sometimes a meatball or two. He also likes scrambled eggs, pizza, Mac 'n' cheese, french fries and most fruits. He loves watermelon.\"\nThis in itself makes life difficult for Losier as a mom trying to make sure her son enjoys a healthy and balanced diet. \"He does eat gummy daily vitamins, but I still worry about his long-term health,\" she said.\nAlso, Dax \"never feels full\" and will \"literally cry for more food that he likes no matter how much he's eaten,\" she said.\nBut what exacerbates the situation for Losier is the lack of understanding shown by many people.\nWhen she first uploaded the videos to TikTok detailing Dax's situation, some of the responses left her upset. \"I definitely feel like we need more awareness,\" Losier said. \"Some of my comment sections are so awful, telling me I should starve him or force him to eat, and it just is not that simple.\"\nBut Dax isn't alone in experiencing these struggles with food. Cherie Miller, an eating disorder psychotherapist, said he might have an eating disorder called avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), which is not an uncommon challenge for autistic kids.\n\"ARFID involves limitations in the amount and/or types of food a person will eat,\" Miller told Newsweek. \"There are three common subtypes of ARFID, and they have different reasons for the restriction: sensory sensitivities, fear of bad things happening—e.g., gagging, choking, vomiting—and a general lack of appetite and an apathy towards food.\"\nMiller said that while parents should seek the help of a therapist and dietitian specializing in eating disorders, as well as a pediatrician, parents can help address the problem.\n\"Treatment for these types of food issues in children does involve challenging kids to eat foods they are afraid to eat, but a gentle approach is best,\" she said. \"That means taking things slow to give kids time to learn coping skills to manage their anxiety and offering lots of support and encouragement.\"\nThat's another element of what made Dax's breakthrough with the chicken nugget so special. It came with the love and support of his mom, who offered quiet encouragement as he took those small but significant bites.\n\"I was nervous right before that he would throw up all over Chick-fil-A, but when he took that bite and chewed it up, I was incredibly proud of him,\" Losier said. \"He has had some other irrational fears that he has overcome recently—after much work—so I think that may have been boosting his confidence as well.\"\nLosier said she originally filmed the video to share it with her family. \"I was so excited after years of attempts by myself and my whole family to get him to try chicken that I wanted to video it.\"\nShe also wanted to thank the staff at the Westmoreland Mall branch of Chick-fil-A in Greensburg for providing the meal for free after learning about Dax's situation.\nLosier ended up posting the clip online, partly because she wanted to offer encouragement to other parents who may be in a similar position.\n\"I hope that it can give some hope to other parents struggling with the same issues,\" she said. \"Keep working with them. Keep offering. Be patient. You never know when they will wake up and decide that today they will say yes to tasting the chicken nugget.\"\n",

        "content": "Two polls have suggested Donald Trump will lose the presidential election, in the latest swing in what has been a tight race so far.\nIn March, the former leader and the incumbent President Joe Biden won enough primary races to secure, respectively, the Republican and Democratic nominations in the 2024 presidential election. Polls have so far shown that the results will be tight as the pair are statistically tied in most surveys or enjoying only marginal leads.\nHowever, two recent polls have suggested Trump is now lagging, marginally. In one poll of 1,046 adults by Florida Atlantic University and Mainstreet Research, 40 percent of all voters said they would vote for Biden and 38 percent would choose Trump in a race in which independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was included.\nWhen only likely voters were polled, 44 percent said they would vote for Biden and 39 percent for Trump.\nThe poll also found that in a two-person race where likely voters were polled, 47 percent would vote for Biden and 46 percent would vote for Trump.\nHowever in a two-person race when all voters were polled, Trump and Biden were tied with 44 percent of the vote each.\nThe poll was conducted between April 26 and April 28. The margin of error is +/- 3 percent.\nMeanwhile, a Reuters/Ipsos poll of 856 registered voters, which closed on Tuesday, found that 40 percent of registered voters would vote for Biden compared with 39 percent who would vote for Trump. However, the one percent lead is down from a four-point lead Biden had in a poll conducted by Reuters/Ipsos earlier in the month.\nThe survey has a 3 percentage point margin of error.\nNewsweek contacted Trump's campaign representative by email to comment on this story.\nMeanwhile, other recent polls have shown Trump is in the lead.\nA CNN poll of 1,212 people conducted by SSRS, an independent research company, between April 18 and 23 found that 49 percent of registered voters supported Trump, while 43 percent supported Biden, for instance.\nAn April poll by Bloomberg News and Morning Consult also indicated that Trump was polling ahead in six key swing states, by 6 points overall.\nAs these swing states may determine the result of the election, these polls are arguably more important than national polls.\nThomas Gift, who heads the Centre on U.S. Politics at University College London, previously told Newsweek that reading too much into polls was \"a fool's errand.\"\n\"Polls are so variable at this point that the only consistent insight we can glean from them is that Biden and Trump are neck and neck—not only nationally but in key swing states,\" he said. \"Trying to read too much into any one poll, or even set of polls, five months out from the election is a fool's errand.\"\nThe presidential election will take place on November 5.\n",

The response has been so staggering that organizers have decided to end the fundraiser as of Friday.\n\"We've been overwhelmed by the sheer force of patriotism on display,\" John Noonan, the organizer, said in a statement sent to Newsweek. \"What started as a simple gesture to reward a courageous act has captured the attention of millions, representing a wide spectrum of the American public.\"\nBy Friday morning, the GoFundMe had raised more than $516,000 from over 14,800 donors. Three donors — identified on the site as John Clark, Adam Sinn, and William Ackman, the outspoken billionaire investor — gave $10,000 each. A Republican congressman from Georgia, Mike Collins, donated $125. Susan Ralston, a former advisor to George W. Bush, also made a contribution and is listed an organizer.\nDespite the overwhelming public response, the fundraiser has stirred some controversy online, particularly concerning its management and transparency. The Pi Kappa Phi chapter at UNC clarified that they were unaware of Noonan's actions and had not authorized the campaign.\n\"We do not know John Noonan and we have been attempting to contact him,\" the fraternity wrote in an email to the local radio station WUNC on Thursday.\nA national Pi Kappa Phi spokeswoman told Newsweek that they did not set up the fundraiser and are not endorsing it.\nAccording to Noonan, who is a former aide to Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton, plans now include not only the promised \"rager\" but also charitable donations. An independent entity, featuring a board of directors along with representation from the fraternity, is being formed to ensure that the funds are used according to donor intent.\nBefore the campaign concluded, Noonan laid out the dual plans of the donations: \"There is nearly half a million in the bank. That is plenty to throw a killer party and give to some great charities.\"\nThe rapid influx of funds and support prompted the organizers to scale up their original plans. Volunteers have been drafted to manage the offers to contribute merchandise, entertainment, and more, Noonan said. A seasoned professional planner has also been retained to handle the complex logistics for the party.\n\"With graduation just around the corner, final exams in full swing, and continued drama on campus, we think it is best to take our time and plan this right,\" Noonan wrote on GoFundMe.\nThe viral incident that kicked off the fundraiser happened when pro-Palestinian demonstrators had replaced the U.S. flag on the campus' main quad with a Palestinian flag. Members of the UNC Chapel Hill chapter of the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity intervened to prevent the American flag from touching the ground, coming under both verbal and physical attacks as they held it up, according to video that circulated widely on social media.\nLike many other elite universities across the U.S., the bucolic Chapel Hill campus has been embroiled in protests between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli groups, who hold differing views on Israel's offensive in Gaza. More than 2,000 people across the country have been arrested since the protests began.\nThe protest movement originated at Columbia University, where students established an encampment demanding the university divest from companies linked to Israel over that country's ongoing war in Gaza, which followed a deadly attack by Hamas on southern Israel on October 7 in which militants killed 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage.\nIn retaliation, Israel's subsequent bombardment of Gaza has caused more than 34,000 deaths, according to the latest report by the Associated Press citing the local Hamas-run health ministry.\nUpdate 5/3/24 1:30 p.m. ET: This story has been corrected to note that Tom Cotton is a senator from Arkansas, not Texas.

Daniels is also said to have urged Davidson to settle the negotiations for the hush money quickly over fears she would lose leverage if Trump lost the election.\nEliason said on X that the attempts by Trump's legal team to suggest Daniels wanted the payment before the 2016 election to maintain leverage over Trump could also help the prosecution set out to the jury why the former president wanted to pay it.\n\"The defense bringing out that Daniels would lose all 'leverage' if the story wasn't purchased before the election is supposed to make it sound like extortion,\" Eliason wrote. \"But it actually helps the prosecution: the story had value to Trump only [because] of its ability to influence the election.\"\nExpanding on his remarks, Eliason told Newsweek: \"Everyone involved recognized that suppressing the story only had value to Trump prior to the election; after that he wouldn't care and wouldn't pay.\n\"The purpose of the hush money was not to avoid public embarrassment or keep the story from Melania—which could be done at any time—it was to influence the election. That is the prosecution's primary theory of the case, and the defense cross of Davidson helped reinforce it.\"\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in relation to $130,000 he arranged for Cohen to pay Daniels to keep an alleged affair she had with Trump secret in the run-up to the 2016 election, which was later listed in company records as Cohen's \"legal fees.\" Prosecutors suggested the payment was part of an unlawful attempt to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential race.\nNewsweek has contacted Donald Trump's legal team for comment via email.\nGeorge Grasso, a former judge at the New York City Criminal Court in Kings County, said Davidson \"produced some fireworks\" during his testimony, with Bove also conducting a \"fiery\" cross-examination.\n\"All told, while the witness had to endure some uncomfortable moments, his testimony appeared to hold together regarding his key role in facilitating the 'hush money' payments at the heart of the People's case,\" Grasso told Newsweek.\nTrump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, said he reimbursed the $130,000 payment to Cohen but denied having an affair with Daniels.\nIn April 2023, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office released a statement of facts about its investigation that said Trump instructed Cohen to delay paying Daniels the $130,000 sum for \"as long as possible\" in the hope that after the 2016 election they could \"avoid paying altogether, because at that point it would not matter if the story became public.\"\nElsewhere during Thursday's proceedings, Bove suggested Davidson approached breaking the law when he sought money from celebrities to stop potentially embarrassing stories about them from becoming public, including an alleged attempt to seek cash from wrestler Hulk Hogan in exchange for a sex tape.\n\"You were pretty well-versed in getting right up to the line without committing extortion, right?\" Bove asked.\nDavidson denied ever committing extortion, saying the settlements he reached with public figures were fair and legitimate.\nUpdate 5/3/24, 10:53 a.m. ET: This article has been updated with further comment from Randall Eliason.\n",

        "content": "Gen Z has been largely left out of Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness options this year, and many are struggling to pay off their monthly payments as they navigate low starting salaries and economic uncertainty.\nRead more: Student Loan Forgiveness Updates and FAQs\nGen Z—born from 1997-2012—graduated during an uncertain job market, with many entering the workforce right when the pandemic upended companies and shifted to a remote work culture. At the same time, the generation has faced some of the highest educational costs, with the average college tuition and fees at a four-year school costing $19,806 per year during the 2021-2022 school year.\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Gen Z has an average of $20,900 in student debt, which is 13 percent higher than millennials. That translates to a median loan of $12,800, which again is around 14 percent higher than that of millennials.\nDespite these factors, the Department of Education has not included Gen Z in most of the student loan relief options available to federal borrowers.\nBiden's current relief initiatives target those who took out loans more than 20 or 25 years ago or those who have worked in public service for 10 or more years.\nAltogether, Biden has canceled almost $160 billion for 4.6 million borrowers, but the majority of that relief comes after years of making loan payments, making Gen Z ineligible since they only recently graduated college or are still attending.\nMichael Lux, an attorney and the founder of the Student Loan Sherpa, said the majority of student debt relief has gone to older borrowers, but it was for a specific reason.\nRead more: Compare 12 of the Best Refinance Student Loans\n\"I'd also say that it is intentional. For many years, borrowers received lousy advice from loan servicers and the Biden fixes have attempted to fix these issues,\" Lux told Newsweek.\nOther times, loan relief went out to borrowers who attended misleading for-profit schools. Most recently, Biden passed $6.1 billion in student debt cancellation for the 317,000 borrowers who attended The Art Institutes.\nThis relief came as the organization \"falsified data, knowingly misled students, and cheated borrowers into taking on mountains of debt without leading to promising career prospects at the end of their studies,\" Biden said.\nThe institution closed its campuses last year after facing fraud accusations, and now everyone who attended The Art Institutes between January 1, 2004, and October 16, 2017, is eligible for forgiveness.\nNot all of Biden's attempts to cancel student debt have been fruitful, though. His administration initially passed $430 billion in student debt forgiveness, but the Supreme Court struck down the policy last year.\nUnder that policy, Biden would have seen more than 40 million Americans benefit, including many Gen Z-ers. The program hoped to offer $10,000 in relief to all borrowers earning less than $125,000. All borrowers who were Pell Grant recipients and came from a low-income background qualified for $20,000 in relief.\nStill, Gen Z is bound to benefit from Biden's loan forgiveness—it just might not be as immediate.\nThe new SAVE plan the Education Department has offered will see many Gen Z-ers get lower student loan bills monthly, if not full forgiveness down the line.\nUnder SAVE, borrowers will have their monthly payments calculated based on their income and family size, with many remaining balances forgiven after several years. Via the new repayment plan, monthly payments range from 5 to 10 percent of a borrower's discretionary income.\nBut none of the relief available negates the overarching problem that has led to the student loan forgiveness policies, Lux said.\nRead more: When Is the FAFSA Deadline?\n\"Ultimately, the root problem with student loans is that college is too expensive,\" Lux said. \"The forgiveness programs help people impacted by this issue, but it does nothing to lower the cost of college.\"\nAs Gen Z waits it out, many might feel tempted to forego their loan payments until another large-scale debt relief plan comes their way, but this would be a mistake, according to Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor at the University of Tennessee at Martin.\n\"It looks like Gen Z student loan holders will mostly have to wait to take advantage of forgiveness programs until 10 years or more after the start of their payments, but they should wait with caution and still make their monthly payments,\" Beene told Newsweek. \"There's no guarantee there will be forgiveness plans down the line, and avoiding your student loan payments will have long-term financial repercussions on their credit score.\"\n",

Like Wordle, a word-based game that took the English-speaking world by storm during the height of the coronavirus pandemic, Connections quickly gained both success and a dedicated fan base trying each day to crack the categories.\nThe idea of the game is to sort a total of 16 words into four categories, each made up of four words. The words in each category all share something in common, and it's your goal to figure out what exactly that is.\nThe categories differ in difficulty—those in the blue category tend to be the easiest to guess.

An Amber Alert was issued for the baby and describes Torres as 28 inches tall and weighing 23 pounds with brown eyes and brown hair.\nThe investigation began after the CPD received a call around 4:30 p.m. on Friday that two female bodies were discovered at Ned Houk Park near Clovis. The female victims, who were both 23 years old and from Texico, New Mexico, were identified by police as Samantha Cisneros and Taryn Allen, according to CPD. Both women were found with \"apparent gunshot wounds, laying on the ground near a silver Dodge minivan,\" police said.\n\"A young female child was also found on the ground suffering from an injury to her head,\" CPD said. \"Officers began giving life-saving measures to the child.\"\nThe little girl was rushed by Clovis EMS to Plains Regional Medical Center before being transferred to a hospital near Lubbock, Texas.

        "content": "After pro-Palestinian protesters briefly disrupted the University of Michigan's graduation ceremony on Saturday, videos shared to social media show the moment the crowd erupted into cheers as the group of students was escorted to the back of the venue.\nAbout 75 people, many of whom held Palestinian flags and signs, protested on Saturday afternoon during the university's spring graduation ceremony at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor.\nThe protesters marched up the main aisle while chanting and carrying signs, including a banner that read: \"No universities left in Gaza.\" While photos captured during the ceremony show numerous students donning traditional Arabic keffiyeh with their graduation caps, at least one decorated his cap with the Israeli flag.\nAbove the stadium, planes flew competing messages, with one reading, \"Divest from Israel now! Free Palestine!\" while the other read: \"We stand with Israel. Jewish lives matter,\" the Associated Press reported.\nUniversity of Michigan spokesperson Colleen Mastony told Newsweek in an email on Saturday evening that no one was arrested and said the protest did not delay the nearly two-hour ceremony, which \"celebrated the achievements of 8,500 undergraduates and 6,622 graduate and PhD students before a crowd of 62,000 wellwishers.\"\n\"The mood was joyous and the ceremony unfolded successfully and was completed without interruption,\" Mastony said. \"Approximately 75 protesters staged a small demonstration at the beginning of the program, walking up the main aisle and chanting before public safety personnel escorted them to the rear of the stadium, where they remained through the conclusion of the event.\"\nMastony continued: \"Peaceful protests like this have taken place at U-M commencement ceremonies for decades. The university supports free speech and expression, and university leaders are pleased that today's commencement was such a proud and triumphant moment, worthy of the achievements of our extraordinary graduates.\"\nVideos shared to X, formerly Twitter, show the demonstration and the moment the crowd erupts into cheers as the group is escorted away. However, it was unclear at the time of publication whether the crowd was cheering in support or opposition.\nThe videos show protesters chanting phrases such as \"Disclose, divest, we will not stop, we will not rest,\" and \"Regents, regents, you can't hide! You are funding genocide.\" Israel has rejected the allegation that its actions in Gaza are genocidal.\nAnother video appears to show people chanting in response to the protesters, yelling \"Shut the f*** up.\"\nX user Aviva Klompas captioned the clip: \"The pro-terror mob is currently ruining graduation day at@UMich.\"\nAuthor Oil London shared a video of the demonstration and wrote: \"University of Michigan commencement ceremony RUINED after mob of anti-Israel activists stormed the ceremony waving Palestinian flags. 'Palestine will live forever.'\"\nAdam Y. Abusalah also shared a video of the protest on X, writing: \"Graduates at the University of Michigan demonstrate for Palestine at the commencement ceremony in Ann Arbor today. 'Disclose, divest, we will not stop, we will not rest.'\"\nU.S. Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro, a commencement speaker, paused several times during his remarks, before saying, \"Ladies and gentlemen, if you can please draw your attention back to the podium,\" the AP reported.\nMeanwhile, pro-Palestinian demonstrations have spread across campuses in the U.S. following the arrests of protesters who set up a \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment\" at Columbia University in New York City on April 18. Since then, encampment demonstrations began popping up at universities all over the country, and hundreds of protesters have been arrested. Participants have been demanding that universities divest from companies supporting Israel as well as a permanent ceasefire to end the Israel-Hamas war.\nIsrael responded militarily after Hamas, a Palestinian militant group, launched a surprise attack on October 7, 2023, on the country that killed roughly 1,200 people and saw over 200 more taken hostage into Gaza. In nearly seven months of fighting, the Palestinian death toll has surpassed 34,000, with more than 76,000 injured in the besieged territory, according to the AP, per the Gaza Health Ministry, which notes that at least two-thirds have been children and women.\nThe staggering number of Palestinian deaths has sparked widespread condemnation from across the globe. Meanwhile, some protests have turned disruptive and violent, prompting police intervention and causing top U.S. lawmakers to pass legislation. Last week, the House of Representatives approved the Antisemitism Awareness Act to address reports of rising antisemitism on college campuses amid allegations of Jewish students being targeted during campus protests.\n",

        "publishedAt": "May 05, 2024 at 10:55 AM EDT",
        "content": "Legal analyst Steve Vladeck wrote Saturday in an opinion piece for MSNBC that a recent move by former President Donald Trump's lawyers in his Mar-a-Lago classified documents case is \"doomed to fail.\"\nIn a new motion filed on Thursday to U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who is overseeing the case and was appointed by the former president in 2020, Trump's lawyers argue that a Chinese immigrant's 1886 Supreme Court triumph provides \"selective prosecution\" precedent for throwing out Trump's charges in the classified documents case.\nTrump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has pleaded not guilty to Department of Justice (DOJ) special counsel Jack Smith's 40 charges where it's alleged that he retained classified materials after he left the White House in January 2021 and then obstructed the federal attempt to retrieve them from his Mar-a-Lago resort residence in Palm Beach, Florida.\nTrump's team cites the Court case, Yick Wo v. Hopkins, involving \"Lee Yick,\" who was convicted for operating an unlicensed laundry in San Francisco. The immigrant sued and eventually won a landmark Supreme Court case that stated that Yick's Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution's 14th Amendment was being violated.\nIn the case's decision, Justice Stanley Matthews wrote that even if a law's wording appears fair, the Constitution bars the law if it is administered \"with an evil eye and unequal hand, so as practically to make unjust and illegal discrimination.\"\nHowever, Vladeck contends in his opinion piece that Trump's lawyers will struggle to convince Cannon that their client is comparable to Yick and his Supreme Court argument.\n\"Like claims about the unfairness of pretrial detention or the severity of the sentences in the Jan. 6 cases, there is a familiar — and perverse — irony at the bottom of Trump's selective prosecution argument,\" Vladeck, a University of Texas School of Law professor, wrote. \"Maybe we ought to discuss limiting the circumstances, in general, in which pretrial defendants can be detained. Maybe we ought to discuss reforms to all federal criminal sentences. Maybe we ought to discuss making it easier for defendants to establish selective prosecution claims. But as the selective prosecution claim in the Mar-a-Lago case makes clear, Trump isn't the poster child for these reforms; he's the anti-poster-child. Indeed, he's in the position he's in entirely because his behavior went so far beyond the limits of that of any of his predecessors.\"\nHe added: \"That wasn't true of Lee Yick, and that why Trump's arguments that he's just like Lee Yick are doomed to fail.\"\nNewsweek reached out to Trump lawyer Todd Blanche Saturday afternoon through his website. This story will be updated with any provided statements.\nThe trial date in the classified documents case has yet to be finalized, but Cannon is expected to postpone it beyond its scheduled start date of May 20.\nVladeck also provided two \"fatal problems\" to Trump's new motion, which was filed by Blanche and Chris Kise.\n\"First, for better or worse, the Supreme Court has made selective prosecution claims notoriously difficult to prove. Second, Trump is just about the worst possible person to bring a selective prosecution claim — since so much of his allegedly unlawful conduct in the Mar-a-Lago case is unprecedented,\" Vladeck wrote in his opinion piece. \"Only if the defendant could prove that the government had deliberately and intentionally singled him out from other similarly situated suspects without any good reason would such a claim succeed.\"\nIn the motion to Cannon, Trump attorneys list current and former government officials, including President Joe Biden, Trump's former Vice President Mike Pence and Trump's former 2016 opponent in the presidential race, Hillary Clinton. They claim that Trump's rivals have acted similarly to the former president in the Mar-a-Lago documents case, but \"no one in the government lifted a finger\" to their actions.\nRobert Hur, the DOJ's special counsel who investigated classified documents found at Biden's home and former offices, said in February that the president cooperated with his probe, which were among several \"material distinctions\" compared to Trump's documents case. Hur didn't bring charges against Biden, but found evidence that Biden willfully held onto sensitive material after he left the vice presidency in 2017.\nTrump's lawyers outline that Pence was found to be holding onto classified documents at his home in Indiana yet was not indicted. The motion says that Pence made a number of disclosures to the National Archives and Records Administration [NARA] after leaving the White House.\nThey also pointed to Clinton's use of a private email server for official messages when she was secretary of state under former President Barack Obama. The FBI did investigate Clinton and chose not to indict.\n\"For try as his brief might, it doesn't identify any other cases with similar claims about affirmative misrepresentations concerning the suspect's retention of classified information. Because there aren't any,\" Vladeck wrote. \"Indeed, the reason Trump's selective prosecution claim should fail is because of how much worse the conduct alleged in the Mar-a-Lago case is than that of the other officials his brief invokes as the relevant exemplars.\"\nHe added: \"In the court of public opinion, where facts don't matter all that much, Trump and his supporters can wave their hands and make the cases look similar. But in a court of law, that's not enough — and shouldn't be enough.\"\n",

        "content": "Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, rebuked Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson, calling it an \"utterly ridiculous\" plan on Saturday.\nGreene, a Georgia Republican, announced on Wednesday that she plans to call a vote on her previously unprivileged motion to vacate Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, sparking criticism from several members of the GOP who warned the move may be damaging to the party.\nGreene introduced the motion to vacate Johnson in March after he passed the $1.2 trillion spending package with Democratic support to fund the government. Greene, a staunch supporter of former President Donald Trump, has continued to scrutinize Johnson over his support for the bipartisan spending bill that includes $60.8 billion of aid to Ukraine in its ongoing war with Russia. Meanwhile, Johnson has continued to face mounting criticism from House conservatives as he pushed forward the bill, which passed House legislation late last month.\nSince Greene's announcement, several Republicans have criticized the congresswoman.\nCruz rebuked Greene's plans on Saturday as he told The Hill, \"I think it is utterly ridiculous and counterproductive.\"\nSenator Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, also criticized Greene on CNN late last month, describing her as \"uninformed\" and a \"total waste of time.\"\n\"She is a horrible leader. She is dragging our brand down. She, not the Democrats, are the biggest risk to us getting back to a majority,\" he said.\nHowever, Greene has previously fired back at her critics as she said that she doesn't \"give a rat's a**\" what her colleagues think about her hopes to remove Johnson.\n\"I voted for Mike Johnson because his voting record before he became speaker was conservative. But once he became speaker, he has become a man that none of us recognize,\" the congresswoman said Wednesday at a news conference announcing her plans to hold a vote.\nNewsweek has reached out to Cruz and Greene's office via email for additional comment.\nSo far, only two other Republicans have come out in support of Greene, Representatives Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona.\nMeanwhile, the House Democratic leadership has also said it is against the vote.\nIf a vote is held on the motion to vacate, Johnson may need to turn to Democrats to save his speakership due to the GOP's slim 4-seat majority. Due to other vacancies, this would leave Johnson with room for only one Republican detractor, barring any Democratic support.\nIn addition, Representatives Anna Paulina Luna and Matt Gaetz, both Florida Republicans, have warned that Greene's efforts could also lead to the possibility that a Democrat could become speaker.\nDuring an interview on Rumble with Gaetz last month, Luna reiterated her criticisms of Johnson, but warned against the possibility that a Democrat could become speaker.\n\"The Uniparty has prioritized foreign interests again and placed America last. Speaker Johnson has gone back on most of what he said when we elected him to be Speaker, rendering him almost unrecognizable as a legislator and the leader we chose. That being said, the possibility of a Democratic-controlled House poses a greater risk. We stand as the last barrier that has stopped Biden from completely ruining our country. Given our historically narrow majority, we must not allow the gavel to pass to the Democrats,\" Luna previously told Newsweek.\nMeanwhile, in response to the recent calls for Johnson to vacate, the House speaker warned about what a motion to vacate would mean for Congress during a press conference last month.\n\"I don't think that would be helpful to us from a political standpoint for the Republican Party to continue to govern, maintain and keep our majority in November. I think that would have been a great hindrance to it. And so, that wouldn't be helpful. Nor does a motion to vacate help us in that regard, either. It would be chaos in the House,\" he said.\n",

The structure for Kyiv symbolizes Russian occupation but is also a key link to transport Moscow's troops and equipment to the frontline and a strike on it could impact its war effort.\nAs well as the bridge, Ukraine has also stepped up its attacks on Russian naval assets in the wider region with repeated strikes on vessels and infrastructure belonging to the Black Sea Fleet, much of which Moscow has relocated to Novorossiysk, in Russia's Krasnodar region.\nZakharova said preparations \"are being carried out openly, with ostentatious bravado and with the absolute and direct support of the collective West.\"\nShe referred to the reported delivery of U.S.-supplied ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems) long range missiles last month, citing the Russian defense ministry's claim that six of the missiles had been shot down over the peninsula last week.\nU.S. officials said last month that Kyiv had started using ATACMS missiles for the first time on a Russian military airfield in Crimea, hitting Russian forces in another occupied area.\nWashington had first delivered mid-range older models of ATACMS missiles last year with a shorter range of around 100 miles but the newer missiles have a range of up to 190 miles, potentially putting hundreds of Russian military facilities in Crimea within range.\nIn her briefing, Zakharova also noted reports that Kyiv was set to receive its first delivery of F-16 aircraft, \"which, according to the British, can also be used in the operation to destroy the Crimean Bridge.\"\n\"We would like to once again warn Washington, London and Brussels that any aggressive actions against Crimea are not only doomed to failure, but will also receive an indestructible blow of retaliation,\" she said, without specifying further.\nNewsweek has contacted the U.S. State Department for comment.\nFollowing her comments, the Russian defense ministry said on Saturday its air defense forces shot down four ATACMS missiles over the Crimean Peninsula, claiming that they had successfully downed 15 of the missiles in recent weeks.\nRussia often claims to have downed Ukrainian missiles and drones without reporting damage, although later reports can show how military targets or infrastructure have actually been struck.\n",

This was seized upon by Volodin who used disparaging language about mental illness to take aim at Zelensky and Biden.\n\"According to these criteria, the first who should be drafted into the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are Biden as a mentally challenged person, as well as his friend Zelensky as a mental patient dependent on various drugs,\" Volodin wrote.\nNewsweek has contacted the White House and Zelensky's office for comment.\nFaced by dwindling troop numbers and calls from relatives of troops on the frontline for soldiers to be rotated, Ukraine faces a critical shortage of personnel as Russia gears up for an expected offensive in the coming weeks.\nWhile many had volunteered for Ukraine's war effort at the start of Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion, high losses as the war dragged on has led to around 650,000 military-aged Ukrainians fleeing the country, through bribes, illegal crossings or fake medical records, according to the BBC.\nLast August, Zelensky fired conscription officers who accepted bribes from those trying to avoid mobilization. The Ukrainian foreign ministry announced on April 24 it would suspend consular services to Ukrainian men overseas aged between 18 and 60 except for those returning. Kyiv has also banned the delivery of identification documents to Ukrainian men of military age abroad.\n",

Russia also attacked Ukraine with four surface-to-air guided missiles while drones attacked the eastern city of Kharkiv, damaging civilian infrastructure, Kyiv said.\nGerman company HENSOLDT will send six more TRML-4D radars to Ukraine to strengthen the country's air defense by the end of the year which the firm told Newsweek was part of a package of aid from Berlin worth over 100 million euros ($107 million).\nThe firm, which also supplies the German Armed Forces, said that the radars can detect and track drones, low-flying cruise missiles and aircraft, including helicopters, within a radius of up to 160 miles. \"Our radars are urgently needed by the Ukrainian air defense,\" said HENSOLDT CEO Oliver Dörre in a statement.\nIt comes as the German government has also said that it will send another Patriot air defense system to Ukraine as soon as possible. Newsweek has contacted the Ukrainian defense ministry for comment.\nAccording to German government figures, Berlin has sent eight TRML-4D radars to Ukraine so far, with another one being announced on April 29 as part of further military assistance.\nDespite the additional German assistance for Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has faced criticism for saying Berlin cannot supply the Taurus KEPD-350 missile, which Kyiv has long called for. Scholz has said its supply would draw Germany into the conflict and would require tactical assistance from Berlin that contravenes NATO members' efforts to contain the war in Ukraine.\nHowever, Berlin has remained a key ally for Ukraine against Russian aggression, having delivered or earmarked €28 billion ($30 billion) worth of military assistance to Ukraine, according to the latest German government figures.\nThe tranche announced this week includes at least 10 Marder combat vehicles, an air surveillance radar, as well as rounds of ammunition for Leopard 2 battle tanks.\nIt comes as Russian forces continue to build on momentum in the eastern front, following the capture of Avdiivka in the Donetsk oblast. Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) Deputy Chief Major General Vadym Skibitsky told The Economist that Russia is likely to launch an offensive at the end of May or the beginning of June.\nHe said Moscow is looking to take advantage of Ukraine's ongoing materiel and manpower shortages before an American military aid package just passed by U.S. Congress is set to arrive.\n",

The Capital International Airport is designed to ease congestion at Cairo's airports and serve as a new regional hub.\nThe Egypt International Olympic City, still in the planning stages, aims to host major international sports events with facilities like the New Administrative Capital Stadium, which will be the largest stadium in Egypt.\nThe NAC has yet to be given a formal name. A competition was launched on the new capital's website to choose a new name and logo for the city. No official results have yet been announced.\nSome government functions have already started the transition from Cairo to the NAC. Khaled Abbas, chairman of the Administrative Capital for Urban Development (ACUD), told CNN last month there are already 48,000 government employees working in the NAC, mostly commuting from greater Cairo via a new electric rail line. Officials hope to eventually centralize Cairo's government and business districts in the area, which will be run by a system of A.I.-powered technologies to optimize utilities, trash collection and the flow of traffic.\nThe NAC is gradually coming to life, with more than 1,500 families already relocated, according to Abbas. By the end of this year, he expects the number to rise to 10,000. The city is projected to house five million residents, taking some of the pressure off Cairo, the congested and polluted capital home to 22 million people.\nStill, there are concerns the NAC will not live up to its promise of being a livable option for vast swaths of Egyptians, with some Cairo residents telling Reuters they \"cannot afford to live in the new city.\" Egypt is notorious for developing new cities in its deserts, promising to alleviate the overcrowded capital. New Cairo, a satellite city established in 2000 was built to house as many as five million people. As of 2017, fewer than 300,000 people lived within its confines.\nEstimated to cost up to $60 billion over four phases of development — with much of the cost shouldered by the Egyptian military — some critics have questioned whether the NAC is an appropriate use of funds. Egypt is facing one of its worst financial crises in decades, and the economy is largely being held up by international loans.\nBut with phase one all but complete and construction on phase two scheduled to begin this year, the NAC is already further along than many of the world's other megaprojects. In Indonesia, where a similar development is in the process of creating an entirely new capital to replace the congested and sinking city of Jakarta, not a single building has yet to be competed despite a grand ribbon-cutting set for this summer.\nDo you have a story we should be covering?

Ukraine also said it had taken out 31 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) putting the total number of destroyed drones at 9,611, only 389 short of the 10,000 mark.\nMeanwhile, Moscow's forces also lost another 27 armored fighting vehicles on Friday for a total of 14,156—less than 900 away from the 15,000 mark.\nBut Russian troop losses continue to mount up, with Kyiv's estimate of 1,260 casualties for Friday being the seventh consecutive day this figure had topped 1,000. That includes both those who are killed and injured and Kyiv says its estimate of both personnel and equipment losses are \"very approximate, and do not claim to be particularly accurate.\"\nNewsweek has contacted the Russian defense ministry for comment.\nGetting an accurate figure of Russian troop losses is difficult but French Foreign Minister Stéphane Séjourne said in an interview released on Friday that Paris estimates Russian casualties were 500,000, 150,000 of whom had been killed.\n\"What is all this for?\" he told independent Russian outlet, Novaya Gazeta Europa. \"In short, there is no need.\"\nRussia has not updated its tally of losses since September 2022 when Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said was just under 6,000.\nKyiv is often tight-lipped about its losses, although in a rare admission, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in February that 31,000 of his troops had been killed.\nHowever, Shoigu said on Friday that Ukraine's troop losses had surpassed 111,000, as he claimed that Russian forces \"continue breaking the enemy's system of strongholds along the entire line of contact.\"\nRussia's Defense Ministry said it has recently captured settlements around the town of Avdiivka, in the Donetsk oblast, which was seized in February.\nShoigu announced the capture of 211 square miles of territory so far this year. This was higher than the figure of 155 square miles he had announced in April.\nThe Institute for the Study of War estimates Russia controls around one fifth of Ukrainian territory, or more than 38,000 square miles.\nThe think tank has predicted that Russia will conduct a major offensive in the coming weeks as it seeks to capitalize on Ukraine's lack of ammunition as it eagerly awaits the delivery of U.S. military aid following a $61 billion package passed by U.S. Congress\n",

When shareholders of Digital World Acquisition Corp., an existing shell company, agreed to merge with TMTG earlier this year—clearing the way for the former president's company to go public—its stock value declined after an initial boost.\nWhen the merged group debuted on the stock market on March 26, under the ticker DJT, shares initially surged above $78, closing its first day of trading at $57.99 and giving the company a valuation of $11 billion. The value of each share in the merged group reached $71.90 on March 27, before its profit and loss figures were released.\nThen, the company's share value declined. On April 17, Google Finance data showed the value of each share at $22.84. That was the lowest the share price had been since January 16, exactly three months earlier, when it was $22.35, meaning the share price was a little more than before it merged with Trump's Truth Social.\nOn April 15, Trump filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) meaning that, pending the SEC's approval, some investors will be able to sell their shares, with one analyst suggesting people sell their stakes in the company.\nIn an apparent effort to avoid this, on April 29, TMTG issued a press release highlighting steps shareholders could take to prevent brokerage firms lending their shares for the purpose of short selling. The release also included a sample email shareholders could send to brokers to opt-out of securities lending programs.\nCompany CEO Devin Nunes, a former Republican congressman from California, also sent a letter to stock market index Nasdaq's chief, Adena Friedman, raising concerns about short selling.\n\"DJT appears on Nasdaq's 'Reg SHO threshold list,' which is indicative of unlawful trading activity,\" the letter, published in an SEC filing on Friday, said. \"This is particularly troubling given that 'naked' short selling often entails sophisticated market participants profiting at the expense of retail investors.\"\nNaked shorting is a form of investing in which shares being bet against are never secured or borrowed. It is banned because it can artificially distort market supply and incite volatility.\nSince then, the value of the shares increased somewhat and, according to April 29 Google Finance data, was up to $41.54 a share.\nOn May 3, the latest available Google Finance data shows it is $48.68 a share. It has been a week since the stock was worth less than $45, showing the company's approach appears to be working.\nHowever, Todd Landman, a professor of political science at the School of Politics and International Relations at the University of Nottingham in the U.K., said the stock was still \"volatile.\"\n\"The stock value remains relatively volatile with its surge to USD $66.22 at the end of March, after which it dropped to USD $22.84, but has seen a steady climb since 16 April back up to USD $48.68 by 2 May,\" he said. \"It has thus not recovered to the value in late March and there remains the key question as to whether Mr. Trump will sell his shares in September, which could affect the share price.\"\nA TMTG spokesperson told Newsweek: \"We will take whatever actions are necessary to prevent our retail investors from being exploited.\"\n",

He is regarded as one of the greatest military commanders in history, helping to expand Egypt's empire to its greatest extent thanks to a succession of victorious campaigns.\nIt is likely that the ancient building in Sinai was used as a royal rest house thanks to the architectural layout and the scarcity of pottery shards found inside, according to the MTA. The pharaoh himself may have used the facility during his military campaigns to expand the Egyptian empire to the east, researchers believe.\nThe building consists of two consecutive rectangular halls, accompanied by a number of rooms. It appears to have been fortified with a perimeter wall.\n\"This discovery is pivotal as it illuminates crucial aspects of Egypt's military history, particularly in the Sinai region, during the New Kingdom era,\" said Mohamed Ismail Khaled, Secretary-General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, as reported by Ahram Online.\nArchaeological work at the site also uncovered a number of burials, indicating that it was used as a cemetery during later periods in ancient Egyptian history.\nThe latest discovery is just one of many ancient finds reported from Egypt in recent months.\nFor example, archaeologists announced earlier this year that they had uncovered the missing upper part of a \"huge\" statue depicting an ancient Egyptian pharaoh.\nA joint Egyptian-American archaeological mission discovered the statue part during excavations conducted at the southern border of the Khemenu/Hermopolis Magna archaeological site, Yvona Trnka-Amrhein, one of the leaders of the project, previously told Newsweek.\nThe ancient city of Khemenu was a provincial capital since Egypt's Old Kingdom and developed into a major settlement during the Roman period.\nIn January, another team unearthed several ancient tombs with dozens of mummies—including some with golden tongues—at the ancient city of Oxyrhynchus, an extensive archaeological site located around 100 miles south-southwest of Cairo near the modern-day municipality of Al-Bahnasa in Minya Governorate.\nOxyrhynchus was \"very important\" during ancient Egypt's Greco-Roman period, which spanned hundreds of years from the late fourth century B.C. until the 7th century, Esther Pons Mellado and Maite Mascort, co-directors of a Spanish archaeological mission at the site, previously told Newsweek.\n\"[It] was the second city of Egypt after Alexandria. There was a great business and cultural relationship between these two cities,\" they said.\nDo you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?

But does the virus pose any threat to humans?\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza is an infectious viral illness that spreads primarily among wild and domestic birds. But the virus that causes bird flu can sometimes jump into animals, including dairy cows and, in some cases, humans.\n\"Bird flu, or avian influenza, infects more than 100 species of wild birds, especially migratory waterfowl,\" Carl Abraham, an assistant professor of medicine at the New York Institute of Technology, told Newsweek. \"In birds, it is highly contagious [and] causes a respiratory illness that is categorized as either highly pathogenic or low pathogenic.\n\"Pathogenicity relates to how sick the infected animal is, and highly pathogenic avian influenza [which is the form of the disease causing the current outbreak] has the ability to spread beyond the airways and lungs to infect multiple organs often resulting in death in birds within 48 hours.\"\nOver the last decade, bird flu cases in mammals have been on the rise.\n\"In most cases, mammal infection is thought to occur after the animal eats an infected bird,\" Abraham said.\n\"In 2024, the first reports of avian influenza (H5N1 strain) infected U.S. domesticated cattle that is possibly being transmitted cow-to-cow. This is now a multistate outbreak although the numbers of cattle infected in each state is small and the illness marked by transient reductions in milk production.\"\nDespite the relatively small number of infected cows, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has identified genetic traces of the virus in 1 in 5 commercial milk samples tested. The virus fragments are not actually capable of causing an infection—the process of pasteurization has seen to that—but the findings raise concerns about the risks associated with unpasteurized \"raw milks.\"\nIn a recent report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, researchers warned that such unpasteurized milk posed a significant for potential cross-species infections. In particular, the study focused on the risks to domestic cats, who have developed fatal infections after drinking unpasteurized milk from affected cows.\n\"Our findings support those of previous work that has shown domestic cats can be highly susceptible to HPAI A (H5N1) virus,\" the study's first author, Eric Burrough, a professor of veterinary medicine at Iowa State University, told Newsweek. \"Cats that have outdoor access should be monitored to avoid potential exposure to and consumption of dead wild birds.\"\n\"It is rare for avian influenza to infect humans,\" Abraham said. \"Two cases have been reported in the U.S., both in persons with significant exposure to infected mammals—most recently this year in a cattle worker in Texas who had conjunctivitis [pink eye] as the only symptom. Therefore, the risk of illness to humans is extremely low.\n\"Persons who own birds that come into contact with wild birds and cattle farmers are at most risk to come into contact with bird flu, but the risk of illness in those persons is still negligible.\"\nHowever, as we saw in 2020, viruses can evolve fast.\nRead more: Compare Top Health Savings Accounts\n\"Influenza has a complicated replication cycle within multiple species,\" Abraham said. \"This frequently causes the genes of different strains within a single host to mix, commonly referred to as recombination events.\n\"Most recombination events result in influenza viruses that are not able to replicate or replicate less efficiently. However, rare recombination events may increase illness severity, increase transmission, or even, as we are seeing with cattle this year, infection of new species. It is possible for a recombination event to give avian influenza the ability to infect humans.\n\"If the same virus caused human-to-human transmission, it could have pandemic potential. Again, this would be a rare event, but it is possible.\"\nWhile no significant threat has been identified for humans, Abraham added that studying viral transmission patterns like this could help predict and prevent future pandemics.\n\"The new information gained as we study viral outbreaks helps us to prepare for the next pandemic [not an \"if,\" but a \"when\" scenario],\" he said. \"Responses to outbreaks based on scientific evidence are most likely to result in the best public health outcome. What we learn today may save us tomorrow. That which we ignore puts as at risk. Stay safe.\"\nIs there a health problem that's worrying you? Let us know via health@newsweek.com.

        "content": "An incredibly rare Roman-era object—made from a substance that was once worth more than its weight in gold—has been discovered at an archaeological site in the United Kingdom.\nThe item was unearthed during excavations conducted in 2023 by archaeologists and volunteers at the site of a Roman bathhouse located within the grounds of a sports club in the city of Carlisle, northern England.\nTesting of the lump—made from a soft, mysterious, purple substance—subsequently revealed that it contained beeswax and an element known as bromine. This is a strong indication that it represents a solid sample of Tyrian purple—a man-made pigment that was highly valued in the ancient world.\nThe dye, which is purple in color, is secreted by several species of predatory sea snails that are found in the Mediterranean region. Producing Tyrian purple was an extremely difficult task. The process was complex and required the collection of thousands of marine snails. In fact, it is estimated that it up to 12,000 individual mollusks would need to be processed to produce just 1 gram of dye.\nAs a result, it was extremely expensive during Roman times, to the extent that it was worth more than gold, pound-for-pound. The pigment was generally reserved for use by the upper echelons of society.\n\"For millennia, Tyrian purple was the world's most expensive and sought after color,\" Frank Giecco, an archaeologist with mining consultancy company Wardell Armstrong, which has been involved in excavations at the Carlisle site, said in a press release.\nFinding a solid sample, such as the one from Carlisle, is a particular unusual find, according to Giecco.\n\"It's the only example we know of in Northern Europe—possibly the only example of a solid sample of the pigment in the form of unused paint pigment anywhere in the Roman Empire,\" Giecco said in the release. \"Examples have been found of it in wall paintings (like in Pompeii) and also some high status painted coffins from the Roman province of Egypt.\"\nTyrian purple is thought to have first been manufactured in the 2nd millennium B.C. by the Phoenicians—an ancient civilization of the Mediterranean region that originated in the coastal Levant region, primarily in an area that is now occupied by modern Lebanon.\nThe purple pigment was most famously produced in Tyre—a city located in Lebanon that is one of the oldest continuously inhabited settlements in the world. However, it was also manufactured in other regions of the Mediterranean, such as North Africa.\nThe Tyrian purple sample from Carlisle was likely used for painting frescos, Sarah Irving, a spokesperson for Cumberland Council, which has partnered with Wardell Armstrong on the excavation project, told Newsweek.\nSometimes the pigment was used to paint walls in grand public buildings, as well as the homes and properties of the elite. However, it was also used to dye clothes.\nExcavations at the site of the Roman bathhouse have unearthed more than 2,800 significant finds to date, including hundreds of coins, carved gemstones and two monumental stone heads.\n\"Following the discovery of the two Roman monumental heads and the other precious items, the project is unearthing some fascinating and globally significant finds. More digs are planned, as well as the opportunity to visit the site and see the ground breaking work underway,\" Cumberland Council councilor Anne Quilter said in the press release.\nBritain was occupied by Rome from A.D. 43 to A.D. 410—with Carlisle located along Hadrian's Wall, which marked the boundary between the empire and the unconquered territories to the north.\nDo you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?

        "content": "Archaeologists investigating a submerged prehistoric settlement have found that it surprisingly managed to survive a period of climate instability that occurred around 8,200 years ago.\nThe village, dubbed Habonim North, now lies below the Mediterranean Sea off the Carmel Coast of Israel, at a depth of around 8 to 10 feet below the surface. Prior to the latest research, almost nothing was known about the settlement aside from its location.\nBut now a team of experts involving researchers from the University of California, San Diego, as well as the University of Haifa (UH) and Bar-Ilan University in Israel, have begun to unravel its secrets in a study published in the journal Antiquity.\nThe research included the first formal excavation of the submerged site, which was first discovered in the mid-2010s and later identified during a survey led by Ehud Arkin Shalev with UH—one of the authors of the study.\n\"The site was re-discovered during our team's surveys. At first, we thought it was a site related to a later archaeological period,\" Roey Nickelsberg, a Ph.D. candidate with UH's Department of Maritime Civilizations, who co-led the excavations, told Newsweek.\nHowever, after examining the finds, including organic remains that the team managed to radiocarbon date, the researchers determined that the site was occupied during the Early Pottery Neolithic period (around 6400–5500 B.C.) of the southern Levant, around the time of a phenomenon that scientists call the \"8.2 ka\" climatic event.\nNickelsberg said it was \"absolutely a surprise\" to find that Habonim North likely dated to this period.\n\"There are many submerged sites in this area but they are all from a later or earlier period,\" he said. \"And and on land there is very limited evidence for settlement during this period, so to identify an active permanent settlement was surprising and exciting.\"\nThe scarcity of contemporary sites in the region potentially reflects the impact of the 8.2ka event, which as the name suggests, took place around 8,200 years ago—or 6200 B.C. The event was characterized by a sudden drop in global temperatures that may have occurred over the space of just few decades. In total, the event may have lasted for roughly a couple of centuries, or more.\nDuring the event, the eastern Mediterranean region, where Israel lies, experienced increasingly arid conditions, effectively resulting in drought across many areas. This would likely have affected the farming communities that were beginning to emerge during this period.\n\"The impact could have been devastating on Neolithic farming communities,\"\nAssaf Yasur-Landau, head of the Recanati Institute for Maritime Studies at UH, who co-led the excavations at Habonim North, told Newsweek.\nPreviously, archaeologists believed that the climate event may have led to the widespread abandonment of coastal settlements in the southern Levant, such as Habonim North.\n\"During the time period related to the 8.2ka event, there seemed to have been no permanent coastal settlements, and, therefore, it was assumed that the coast was abandoned and then resettled later,\" Nickelsberg said.\nBut the latest study suggests that at least one village remained occupied throughout the period of climate instability.\nThe team's investigations at the site uncovered a variety of remains, including pottery shards, stone tools (such as ceremonial weapons and possible fishing net weights), animal and plant remains, and traces of architecture.\nThe researchers managed to date some of the organic remains using radiocarbon techniques, including those of wild and domesticated animals, as well as the charred seeds of plants. This work—alongside an analysis of the other remains—helped to date the site to the Early Pottery Neolithic, which coincided with the 8.2ka event, not to mention the emergence of pottery in the Levant region.\n\"It was only after our first excavation season when we analyzed the finds and applied radiocarbon dating to the site that we understood the site was in the ballpark of the 8.2ka climate event,\" Tom Levy, a co-author on the paper with the UC San Diego Center for Cyber-Archaeology and Sustainability at the Qualcomm Institute, told Newsweek.\nIt is unclear exactly how the prehistoric inhabitants of Habonim North survived, or even what impacts the 8.2ka event had on them. But the settlement—which had access to marine resources, as well as farmland for growing crops—provides some clues, displaying evidence of a diverse economy.\nThe ability to extract both marine resources (such as fish, shrimp, crab, lobster, clams, mussels, oysters, octopus) and land-based agricultural resources (for example, cereals, meat from wild game and domestic animals, as well as their secondary products, like milk) may have provided these early farmer-fishers with a \"flexible strategy to survive,\" Levy said.\nFurthermore, the inhabitants would have been able to store their surplus with the novel technology of pottery. There is even evidence that the settlement may have engaged in trade or exchange with other communities, which would have boosted its resilience by providing access to additional resource streams.\n\"In Habonim North we have an exciting window into life in a crucial period within the Neolithic—the beginning of the use of pottery,\" Yasur-Landau said. \"The ability to store goods in containers, as well as to cook and serve food in ceramic pots and bowls, changed society for millennia. It's astonishing that even in this very early stage, the pottery at the site came from different sources. It is possible that we have the beginning of trade in both vessels, as well as in agricultural products stored in vessels.\"\nThe results of the study indicate that at least some early Neolithic societies in the region were \"resilient and sustainable\" in the face of abrupt climatic changes, according to the researchers.\nDo you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?

        "content": "Having a gas stove in your home is bad for your health, researchers have found, and it could kill thousands of people across the country every year.\nPeople living in homes with a gas or propane stove breathe unhealthy amounts of nitrogen dioxide or NO₂, one of the pollutants from car exhaust, according to a paper in the online journal Science Advances. Long-term exposure to this NO₂ could trigger asthma in hundreds of thousands of people, as well as killing as many as 19,000 people annually.\nThis finding comes as the U.S. Department of Energy announced new energy-efficiency guidelines for gas and electric stoves earlier this year, which has brought a backlash.\nGas stoves work by burning gases, usually natural gas—a mixture of hydrocarbons but mostly methane—or propane. This burning can release byproducts, including harmful gases like carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides like NO₂.\nNO₂ primarily affects the respiratory system. It can cause or worsen respiratory diseases, particularly asthma, leading to symptoms like wheezing, coughing, colds, flu and bronchitis. Prolonged exposure can decrease lung function and increase the risk of respiratory infections.\nThere is also some evidence that NO₂ can exacerbate existing heart conditions, leading to increased hospital admissions and even premature death. Long-term exposure to NO₂ may also affect the development of the lungs in children.\nAround 38 percent of U.S. households have gas stoves, according to the federal Energy Information Administration, although certain states have much higher numbers of gas stoves than others.\nPollutant gases from gas and propane stoves may be responsible for as many as 200,000 current childhood asthma cases, 25 percent of which are due to NO₂ alone, the paper said.\n\"We found that just how much gas you burn in your stove is by far the biggest factor affecting how much you're exposed. And then, after that, do you have an effective range hood—and do you use it?\" said study co-author Yannai Kashtan, a Ph.D. student in Earth system science at Stanford University, in a statement.\nThe researchers also found that long-term exposure to the NO₂ in American households with gas stoves may lead to 40 percent as many deaths as those caused by secondhand smoke, which comes to around 19,000 people each year. This estimate doesn't even factor in the short bursts of NO₂ that are often seen in homes with gas stoves.\n\"I didn't expect to see pollutant concentrations breach health benchmarks in bedrooms within an hour of gas stove use and stay there for hours after the stove is turned off,\" study author Rob Jackson, a professor in Earth system science at Stanford, said in the statement. \"It's the whole family's problem.\"\nUsing a gas or propane stove in the home increases exposure to NO₂ by an estimated 4 parts per billion on average during a year, which is about three-quarters of the way toward the NO₂ exposure level classified as unsafe in outdoor air by the World Health Organization.\n\"That's excluding all outdoor sources combined, so it makes it much more likely you're going to exceed the limit,\" said Kashtan.\nThe paper also reveals that smaller homes are more at risk of these effects, with people in small two-bed apartments being exposed to around twice as much NO₂ as the national average and four times that of people living in homes over 3,000 square feet.\n\"Electric stoves emit no nitrogen dioxide or benzene. If you own a gas or propane stove, you need to reduce pollutant exposures using ventilation,\" Jackson said.\nThe effect of home sizes means that there is a major trend in NO₂ exposure among those with low incomes as well as racial and ethnic groups. The paper found that American Indian and Alaska Native households had a 60 percent higher exposure to NO₂ than average, while Black and Hispanic or Latino households had a 20 percent higher exposure than average. This also is compounded by the fact that these communities may be exposed to higher levels of NO₂ from other sources, including vehicle exhaust.\n\"People in poorer communities can't always afford to change their appliances, or perhaps they rent and can't replace appliances because they don't own them,\" Jackson said. \"People in smaller homes are also breathing more pollution for the same stove use.\"\nDo you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?

        "content": "Following the Miami Sprint race, FIA stewards have proposed a review of penalty systems for repeat offenses. This development followed a series of penalties issued to Haas driver Kevin Magnussen for multiple track excursions while battling with Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton.\nDuring the recent Miami Sprint, an intense on-track battle between Kevin Magnussen and Lewis Hamilton caught the attention of the FIA stewards. Magnussen, who was penalized three times for leaving the track, has now become the focal point in a broader discussion about the adequacy of current penalty regulations concerning repeated infringements.\nKevin Magnussen, in his post-race comments to Sky Sports F1, acknowledged the fairness of the penalties assessed against him. He explained his race tactics, which were primarily designed to assist his teammate, Nico Hulkenberg. He explained:\n\"All the penalties were well deserved - no doubt about it. I was in a very good position behind Nico there. In the beginning of the race, I gained a lot of positions and was up in P8. I was protecting well from Lewis because I had the DRS from Nico and I had good pace.\n\"Then Nico cut the chicane and I lost the DRS. Nico could have given that back to give me the DRS to protect because then we would have easily been P7 and P8. Instead, I was really vulnerable to Lewis. Started fighting with him like crazy and I had to just create the gap like I did in Jeddah.\n\"I started using these stupid tactics which I don't like doing, but at the end of the day I did my job as a team player and Nico scored his points because I got that gap for him so Lewis and Tsunoda couldn't catch him.\n\"Not the way I like to go racing at all, but it was what I had to do today.\"\nThe stewards, upon reviewing the incidents, cleared Magnussen of any unsportsmanlike behavior and recognized his acceptance of the standard penalties. The stewards' report highlighted as quoted by Motorsport Week:\n\"The driver candidly explained that he thought that he was entitled to race with Car 44 in the manner that he did and also that he was willing to accept what he considered to be standard penalties that would have been imposed on him for any infringements that occurred while he was battling for position.\n\"He was also of the view that building a gap between himself and the cars ahead was perfectly within the regulations and it was not uncommon for a driver to seek to assist his team-mate in the course of a race by doing so.\n\"He did not at any point in time think that what he was doing was wrong or that it was in any way unsportsmanlike.\"\nIn light of these events, the stewards have suggested a review of the penalty system for repeat offenses, signaling a potential shift in how future races might be regulated. They noted the necessity of enhancing penalties to deter drivers from repeatedly leaving the track, thereby maintaining the integrity of the sport.\nThe report from the Stewards continued:\n\"Moving forward, the Stewards will need to consider if, in appropriate situations, especially in the case of repeat infringements, the penalties to be applied for each infringement need to be increased to discourage scenarios such as those that we found today.\n\"This is something that we will raise explicitly with the FIA and the Stewarding team.\"\n",

        "content": "Following another defeat in the Super Bowl, once again at the hands of the Kansas City Chiefs, the San Francisco 49ers entered the offseason wondering what went wrong. San Francisco has been so close to getting itself back to the mountaintop, only to see everything crumble right before its eyes.\nThe 49ers changed quarterbacks and brought in more offensive weapons to counter the Chiefs, only for the same result to occur as did during their prior Super Bowl encounter. The 49ers' front office has taken a long look at where else the team could tweak its roster, bringing about rumors of San Francisco moving off one or both of its two-star wide receivers. Both Deebo Samuel and Brandon Aiyuk are looking for massive contract extensions, something that the 49ers will need to address at some point.\nWhile trade rumors swirled, 49ers general manager John Lynch fueled the fire by drafting wide receiver Ricky Pearsall out of the University of Florida in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft.\nLynch appeared on ESPN's \"The Pat McAfee Show\" and addressed the rumors that the 49ers may be looking to move off one of, or even both, receivers this offseason.\n\"I love our roster,\" Lynch said. \"I love the way it's comprised. As I said, we were right there. And we got to find a way to get just a little bit better. And I'm doing everything in my power to keep our roster together and that's my goal.\"\nHere are three intriguing possible landing spots for either Samuel or Aiyuk, if the 49ers do move on from them:\n1. Pittsburgh Steelers\nIf there is any club that needs to land a big-time wide receiver, it's the Pittsburgh Steelers. After trading away Diontae Johnson this offseason, the Steelers are left relying on George Pickens to be their top option. They did draft Roman Wilson out of Michigan, but relying on a rookie can be tough.\nIf Pittsburgh were to land either Samuel or Aiyuk, it could be a game-changer within the AFC North. Landing either one of them could vault the Steelers toward the top of the division, and would give presumed starting quarterback Russell Wilson some talent to work with. Don't sleep on Pittsburgh being aggressive here after a great offseason so far.\n2. Buffalo Bills\nAfter trading away Stefon Diggs and letting Gabe Davis walk, the Bills find themselves in a precarious spot at the wide receiver position. While the team did draft Keon Johnson and sign Chase Claypool, Buffalo could use a star.\nSomeone like Samuel or Aiyuk would help this offense thrive and give quarterback Josh Allen a true No. 1 option to throw too. Buffalo has been aggressive in the past in making trades, so there is no reason to think they won't be here.\n3. Washington Commanders\nAfter drafting No. 2 overall pick Jayden Daniels, Washington needs to surround the exciting young quarterback with weapons to throw the ball too. While they have Terry McLaurin, they could use another star next to him. Either Samuel or Aiyuk would do wonders for this Commanders offense and the team has all their draft picks for the next few years.\nSan Francisco could easily recoup some draft capital here and use Pearsall to fill the void. Washington makes a lot of sense but the 49ers may want to push for a trade to an AFC squad instead.\n",

Ham was hired just two years ago and had taken the team to the Western Conference Finals a year ago, but in the world that is the Lakers, that isn't good enough. Los Angeles demands excellence from its team and coaching staff, something Ham couldn't live up to.\nHe came under fire this past season due to his inability to make in-game adjustments when needed. Ham also never took accountability for his mistakes, something that rubbed the players and organization the wrong way.\nLos Angeles will now be looking for their third head coaching hire since 2020 and they are hoping the third time is the charm. Los Angeles wants stability at the coaching position, but the club's inability to identify the right person for the job has been troubling.\nRumors have been flying about the potential of them going after Tyronn Lue if he is let go by the Los Angeles Clippers, but all signs point to the two sides staying together.\nIn fact, Lue mentioned that he hopes to stay with the Clippers for a long time. He has built up strong relationships with members of the Clippers' front office and would love to continue working alongside them, per Ohm Youngmisuk and Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN:\nLue likely staying with the Clippers would serve as a blow to the Lakers' plans. But even if Lue did want to join the Lakers, Los Angeles would need to give the Clippers some type of compensation, unless he was fired. Clippers owner Steve Ballmer isn't just going to hand Lue over to the inter-city rivals so a firing is unlikely.\nThe connection that Lue has with Lakers superstar LeBron James has made him their primary target. Lue led James' Cleveland Cavaliers clubs to three consecutive NBA Finals appearances from 2016-18, including a win in '16.\nBut Los Angeles will likely have to look elsewhere for its new head coach. Names such as Mike Budenholzer, Kenny Atkinson, and JJ Redick have surfaced for the Lakers, but they are expected to take their time executing interviews.\nThe hope for the Lakers is that they can find the right person to lead the ship forward, maximizing the potential of the roster that the front office puts together. James can become a free agent this summer as well, but all indications are that he will remain with the team for his final few years in the NBA. As it always is for the Lakers, it will be a drama-filled summer but one that could dictate how the next decade goes for this franchise.\n",

        "content": "With the Los Angeles Clippers' early playoff exit at the hands of the Dallas Mavericks on Friday night, it has left Los Angeles staring directly into a potentially grim reality. Once again, injuries were the narrative of their season but this time, the organization may have drastic changes coming. Stars Paul George and James Harden could both leave the team in free agency, even if reports say that the organization wants to keep them together.\nHarden is an actual free agent, with George needing to decline his player option to become one. Harden has become somewhat of a negative asset to his teams over the years, even if he put together a good showing with the Clippers this season.\nLos Angeles will need to decide if they want to commit long-term to this unit, which includes retaining Harden despite his poor playoff struggles again.\nIf Harden does leave the Clippers, there will be interested teams. Here are five potential landing spots for the former MVP this summer.\n1. Los Angeles Clippers\nIn most scenarios, Harden will end up back with the Clippers. However, nothing is a forgone conclusion within the NBA. But the veteran guard seemed happy to be in his hometown.\nHarden said after Game 6 that he wasn't sure what he would do regarding his contract. But he would probably prefer to stay with the Clippers if possible.\n\"I don't even know,\" Harden reflected postgame, per Ohm Youngmisuk of ESPN. Harden finished with 16 points, 13 assists and seven rebounds Friday but missed all six of his three-point attempts. \"You are asking a lot of questions that I don't have the answer to or haven't even thought about.\"\nHarden wasn't a full distraction for this Clippers team, something he has had issues with in the past. Unless something drastic happens, such as contract negotiations go south, expect Harden to be back with the Clippers next year.\n2. San Antonio Spurs\nThe Spurs were once a proud organization and the class of the NBA. But multiple poor seasons in a row have left them reeling and searching for any sign of hope. Landing the No. 1 pick in the 2023 NBA Draft last season has seemed to do the trick and Victor Wembanyama looks like the next NBA superstar.\nPairing Harden up with Wembanyama could be scary for the rest of the league. The pick-and-roll offense alone would be lethal, creating relevance for the Spurs once again. San Antonio may need to make some moves to open more cap space up to outright sign the former MVP or they could try to pull a sign-and-trade with the Clippers.\n3. Orlando Magic\nThe Magic are still in the playoffs, currently preparing to face off in a Game 7 against the Cleveland Cavaliers. But Orlando has grown up a lot this season. They still need a point guard to help run the offense and Harden could be the missing piece for them.\nPairing up with young sensation Paolo Banchero could be interesting, giving the Magic more credibility within the Eastern Conference. Orlando should have plenty of cap space to work with this summer, opening the door to them landing Harden without giving anything up.\n4. New Orleans Pelicans\nNew Orleans was swept out of the postseason by the Oklahoma City Thunder this season and changes are likely coming to them as well. The Pelicans could use a more true point guard to take guard CJ McCollum off the ball, potentially opening the door for Harden to come in.\nThe Pelicans would likely need to make a trade to land Harden so a sign-and-trade may be possible. In the event that George departs the Clippers, maybe they'll look to New Orleans for Brandon Ingram. A swap of Harden for Ingram, with some extra pieces included, could work out well for both sides.\nEvan Sidery of Forbes reported that New Orleans isn't likely to offer Ingram a contract extension and that they could move him this summer. Landing Harden would be a financial commitment for the Pelicans but not as much if they were to extend Ingram.\nNew Orleans would get a point guard who can facilitate the offense around Zion Williamson, and the Clippers would replace George with a younger, more lengthy forward. It could be a win-win for both sides if the normally disgruntled Harden has his eyes set on New Orleans.\n5. Houston Rockets\nJust last season, the Rockets were one of the top landing spots for Harden, but nothing ever materialized. Could Houston look to their former star to once again help lift them forward?\nIt's possible but unlikely. The biggest hurdle was Rockets head coach Ime Udoka not being too big of a fan of bringing Harden back.\n\"Nothing against James,\" Udoka told Zach Lowe of ESPN, \"but Fred is just a better fit. I coached James in Brooklyn. He's one of the smartest players I've ever been around. The words 'Ime doesn't want James' never came out of my mouth. It was, 'Let's look at the best fit.'\nThe Rockets have created a strong culture without him so going back to him could ruin that. Houston is never out of the running when it comes to Harden but it's the least likely from this list of teams.\n",

        "content": "Red Bull's Managing Director Oliver Mintzlaff has issued a stark warning to Mercedes' CEO Toto Wolff regarding his public overtures towards star driver Max Verstappen. The rebuke follows Wolff's comments admiring Verstappen amidst Mercedes' pursuit of replacing seven-time F1 champion Lewis Hamilton who is set to join Ferrari in 2025.\nMintzlaff, responding to Wolff's comments, firmly reestablished Verstappen's commitment to Red Bull. He articulated the importance of the Mercedes chief focusing on internal team challenges rather than eyeing talents contracted with rival teams.\n\"This is a decision that Max needs to take, but there is no team up and down the grid that wouldn't do handstands to have him in the car,\" Wolff had previously stated as quoted by ESPN, acknowledging the allure Verstappen holds across the Formula 1 grid. He added, touching on the difficulties that the team has faced with the ground-effect cars, \"I'd love to have him, but first we need to sort out our car. First, we owe it to George [Russell] and Lewis [Hamilton] to improve the car and give them equipment that is good before dreaming about the future next year.\"\nCountering this, Mintzlaff was explicit in his disapproval of Wolff's public courtship of Verstappen. \"I understand the pressure that Toto Wolff and perhaps other teams have after years of being behind, but I think Toto should concentrate on his challenges. He has enough of those,\" Mintzlaff expressed in an interview with Bild Am Sonntag, as quoted by Pit Pass. He underscored the disrespect perceived in discussing another team's key assets, stating, \"It also has something to do with respect. If I keep talking about the personnel of other teams, that's not right.\"\nMintzlaff also highlighted that Verstappen has not shown any desire to abandon his current team, reinforcing the strong relationship and trust built between him and Red Bull's leadership, including Christian Horner and Helmut Marko.\n\"Max still has a long-term contract here and hasn't said a word that he doesn't want to fulfil it,\" he said. \"I'm not at all worried that he's considering a move. Things just have to calm down again now. That's what Max wants, and that's what we want too.\n\"At least I can't think of any. Max wants the fastest car... we have this. Max wants to become world champion... with us, he has the best chances.\n\"Max is a loyal guy,\" he added. \"He knows that Christian Horner and Helmut Marko have always placed their trust in him. He appreciates that. In addition, Red Bull is simply a great brand that he can extremely identify with. So there are many reasons for staying, and none against.\"\nAdditionally, Mintzlaff addressed the shocking exit of Chief Technical Officer Adrian Newey, who will be leaving the team in 2025. He commented:\n\"Adrian has done great things here over the years and played a big part in us winning 13 world championship titles.\n\"It's obviously a shame that he's leaving us, but we discussed it in a very fair and respectful dialogue. What he leaves behind is not only a unique legacy but also a structure that he helped to build.\n\"Of course, we will miss him, also as a person, but tomorrow we will still know how to build a very fast Formula 1 car.\"\n",

        "content": "Many consequences of cyber breaches have been well-documented, including financial and reputational damage. Recent developments, however, show that another serious consequence stands to become top of mind for business leaders: legal action against both the management and members of the boards of directors of organizations that suffer cyber breaches.\nAccording to cybersecurity expert Joseph Steinberg, the SEC's recent charges against the chief information security officer (CISO) of SolarWinds, combined with its new cybersecurity disclosure rules, should leave no doubt in anyone's mind that the government is demanding companies to \"get their cybersecurity houses in order.\"\n\"In a worst-case scenario, a cyber breach could lead to criminal charges against people,\" Steinberg says. \"We are talking about not only financial penalties, but, under some circumstances, potential prison time.\"\nThe SEC's filing against the SolarWinds CISO is not the first instance in the United States of criminal charges being leveled against a cybersecurity professional. Steinberg points to the case of former Uber chief security officer (CSO) Joseph Sullivan, who, until his sentencing, faced potential prison time for his role in the attempted covering up of a 2016 data breach that exposed personal information for more than 50 million customers of the ride-hailing platform. According to an article in SC Media, the former Uber CSO was ultimately punished with a probation sentence, a fine and a requirement to perform community service \"tied to a cover-up of Uber's 2016 breach.\"\nHowever, the SEC's new disclosure rules and its charges against the SolarWinds CISO have potentially changed the equation for companies when it comes to cyber breaches, Steinberg explains. The federal government is taking cyber breaches seriously, and company leaders should heed the recent news as a warning.\n\"Essentially, the onus has shifted as to who is responsible,\" Steinberg says. \"Instead of viewing cyber incidents as something that happened to a company, as something that doesn't necessarily need to be explicitly explained in filings or revealed to the public, the new rules basically say that if an incident occurs, the company's management and board are responsible to ensure that they adequately explain to the world what happened.\"\nSteinberg stresses that being upfront with investors about material cyber risks is paramount. In short, investors need to know what a company is doing to address cyber threats, how it has historically handled any cyber incidents, what damages have occurred due to any past cyber incidents and what damages are at risk of happening due to potential future cyber incidents.\n\"Someone's decision to invest in a company can be dramatically impacted by information about cyber risks,\" Steinberg says, adding that by not being upfront about cyber risks and incidents, companies could be misleading the public — which can reasonably be considered akin to \"falsifying a financial statement.\"\nPer analysis by Thomson Reuters, it's \"not explicitly mandated\" in the SEC's new rules, but \"firms are expected to provide details on board proficiency in cybersecurity.\" The directive from the SEC makes it clear that public corporations have \"to describe the board of directors' oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats and management's role and expertise in assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats.\"\nTo comply with the SEC's new rules around cybersecurity, companies need board members with the right type of cybersecurity experience and skills, Steinberg says.\n\"Companies need people on their boards who can oversee the management of cyber risk, not people who are technically savvy but do not understand how to ensure that the business is properly managing cyber risk,\" he says. \"The board must oversee the management of cyber risk rather than seeking to perform or actively manage the job of the CISO.\"\nUnfortunately, many companies do not have board members with adequate, appropriate cyber expertise. Findings from 2023 research conducted by WSJ Pro revealed that the \"number of directors at S&P 500 companies who have cybersecurity experience has increased sharply since\" 2022; however, the \"amount of cybersecurity expertise on boards remains relatively low, at a time when boards are under increased scrutiny for security failings.\" Specifically, the research found that as of August 31, 2023, \"107 directors at 113 companies had professional experience in cybersecurity.\"\nBut Steinberg cautions against boards rushing the process of signing on people with cybersecurity expertise.\n\"One of the problems that many boards face is that they bring on people who aren't necessarily skilled at overseeing cybersecurity,\" Steinberg says. \"Just because someone is an excellent baseball player does not mean that he will make an excellent team manager, and just because someone is an excellent manager does not mean that he will make an excellent team CEO. The same is true when it comes to managing and overseeing cyber risk. Boards need the right combination of experience, skills and talent to properly handle cyber risk, as opposed to merely thinking they are handling it well.\"\nTo that end, Steinberg emphasizes that it is vital for companies to empower the right people to play the right roles when it comes to cybersecurity. Specifically, CISOs, CSOs and other cyber experts should manage cybersecurity and should ensure that the necessary parties perform what is needed in order to handle day-to-day tasks and to develop and implement broader strategies. Board members should oversee the party managing cybersecurity to make sure that the cybersecurity program provides the company with adequate protection (as agreed upon by the board) against cyber risk.\n\"One of the issues that I see develop on a regular basis is board members getting overly involved in what they think is the oversight of cyber risk—but is actually the management or performance of it,\" Steinberg says. \"In turn, they end up wasting time and energy discussing matters that should be left to the CISO.\"\nHe notes that when board members attempt to take cybersecurity fully under their control, it takes away their focus from other elements of the business—and can make a company more exposed than if the management of cyber risk was properly overseen by the right experts.\n\"Board members who do not understand their appropriate role in dealing with cybersecurity and cyber risk can end up interfering with the CISO or CSO's ability to do their job,\" Steinberg says. \"Additionally, the failure of board members to understand where they fall into a company's cybersecurity and cyber risk management efforts can cause the board as a whole to become distracted—and in turn, fail to address pressing matters across the business.\"\nUltimately, he says, those organizations that do not yet have cybersecurity expertise present on their boards should take action now.\n\"In the same way that you wouldn't have a board that lacks accounting and legal expertise, you shouldn't have a board without cybersecurity expertise,\" Steinberg says. \"For many companies, a cyber incident is more likely to pose serious danger than accounting or legal issues.\"\nIdeally, he says, companies should appoint people who are \"familiar with the management of information security and cybersecurity.\"\n\"To not have that level of expertise is like presenting financial documents to board members with little to no accounting knowledge,\" Steinberg says.\n",

Within these crucibles of creativity and scientific rigor, young minds are not just honed — they are transformed, contesting the orthodoxy that separates the intellectual from the intuitive. Both opportunities herald a paradigm shift in pedagogy, where students engage in entirely new dimensions of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) competitiveness.\nU.S. Drone Soccer is where technology and teamwork ascend to new heights, showcasing a sport redefined by innovation and strategic ingenuity. This competition goes far beyond the traditional confines of athletic endeavor, melding the physical with the intellectual, to craft an environment where students are not just athletes but innovators and strategists. The drone soccer ball, a symbol of technological accessibility and creativity, serves as a testament to the power of STEM education, remodeling students from passive learners into active makers and problem-solvers.\nU.S. Drone Soccer is a well-founded educational experience that challenges students to build, program, and pilot their drones. This hands-on approach not only cements theoretical knowledge but also imbues students with a sense of kinesthetic accomplishment and a drive to explore new technological frontiers. Through the meticulous construction and programming of drones, participants learn the criticality of every component, the value of persistence, and the joy of collective achievement.\nAs educators lead these young innovators through the intricacies of the assembly process and flight dynamics, they are nurturing a future workforce equipped with the skills necessary for the challenges of tomorrow. The U.S. Drone Soccer Association, now boasting over 200 programs nationwide, is working to satisfy the growing demand for immersive, technologically oriented education.\nFrom its inception in early 2020, sparked by the World Air Sports Federation's recognition of the untapped potential within the U.S. market, U.S. Drone Soccer has swiftly ascended from a nascent sport to a national phenomenon — with worldwide ambitions. The establishment of the U.S. Drone Soccer Association and the development of an FAI-compliant drone soccer ball assembly kit mark significant milestones in this journey.\nWith the success of the first-ever National Championship in 2023 and the remarkable triumph of the Sato Academy Red Dragons in international competition, U.S. Drone Soccer has proven its efficacy as a platform for global achievement. The anticipation for the 2024 National Championship, set against the backdrop of Virginia's technological landscape, hints at the burgeoning legacy of this pioneering sport.\nAs we pivot from aerial feats and teamwork epitomized by drone soccer, we turn our gaze to the ground, where another form of competition beckons.\nRobofest, emerging from the ingenuity of Lawrence Technological University, stands as a bastion of innovation and a celebration of the mind's limitless potential. This festival, a symphony of autonomous robotics, unfurls a canvas where students from diverse backgrounds converge to weave the threads of STEAM (STEM + Arts) and computer science into a tapestry of ingenuity and fun. Here, robots become more than metal and code; they are recast as vehicles of learning, embodiments of students' creativity and problem-solving prowess.\nThe historical evolution of Robofest is a narrative of continuous innovation and pedagogical refinement. Since its inception in the 1999-2000 academic year, the festival has been a cradle of self-directed learning, encouraging students to transcend the boundaries of fixed rules and venture into realms of unfettered creativity and innovation. The introduction of the exhibition category and the Unknown Mission Challenge exemplify Robofest's commitment to nurturing critical thinking and adaptability, empowering students to tackle unforeseen challenges with grace and ingenuity.\nAs Robofest evolved, it embraced the arts, merging technology with creativity in RoboParade and the Global Robotics Art Festival, and later, RoboArts. These events exemplify the fusion of engineering and artistry, highlighting the holistic nature of STEAM education and the importance of integrating diverse disciplines to foster well-rounded learning experiences.\nThe small team sizes at Robofest are not by mere chance but by design, ensuring that each participant engages deeply with the material and contributes meaningfully to their team's objectives. This philosophy has cultivated an environment where learning is intimate, collaborative, and profoundly impactful.\nFrom the Vision Centric Challenge, inspired by the DARPA Urban Challenge, to the foundational Robot Sumo and its evolved counterpart, BottleSumo, Robofest has continually expanded its horizons, offering myriad avenues for students to explore, learn, and grow. The WISER conference and collaboration with AccelerateKID stands as a testament to the community's dedication to advancing robotics education, providing a platform for sharing knowledge and fostering a global dialogue on the future of STEAM learning.\nThe journey of Robofest, marked by its adaptability, innovation, and commitment to education, mirrors the broader narrative of technology's role in shaping our future.

        "content": "Recent statistics pointing to employee training fatigue, particularly in the context of IT and security training, highlight a growing concern about the effectiveness of training programs and their ability to adequately engage employees. This is not only true among the general population of employees, but also among IT staff members. One study found that 25% of IT security professionals are seriously considering leaving their jobs — 24% are considering leaving the profession entirely.\nA related concern — especially as many organizations have transferred much of their learning and development (L&D) activities into the digital realm, is growing fatigue related to digital overload. This overload, along with a proliferation of communication channels, is leading to a drop in engagement with cybersecurity training — 45% say that this overload is reducing their ability to effectively identify and respond to cybersecurity threats.\nThat's a situation that organizations and their HR and L&D staff need to be aware of and take steps to address. Here are some ways you can improve your cybersecurity awareness training efforts to achieve better results.\nMost cybersecurity training — in fact, most corporate training, in general — tends to be all too painfully similar. The pandemic drove many training efforts online and there many stayed. There's a benefit in being able to access training on-demand, but there can be tedium too. While this mainstay format may be part of your training efforts, consider ways you might dare to be different when providing cybersecurity training.\nSuggestions:\n• Random, interactive polls in a competitive format with \"winners\" applauded and \"losers\" privately provided with personalized coaching.\n• Pop-up news notifications challenges. When a breach occurs at an organization like yours, push the news out to staff along with a challenge question. For instance: \"What steps could you personally take to help prevent something like this from happening at our office?\" Share the best responses at an all-hands meeting or in the company newsletter.\n• Provide training in tidbits. Arm managers and supervisors with brief key points or messages that can be shared in bite-sized pieces, quickly, during staff meetings.\n• User-generated content. Get employees involved by challenging them to create brief TikTok-like videos highlighting important cybersecurity points in a fun and entertaining way. Offer prizes for the best/most liked content.\nThere are a variety of ways that you can think creatively about how to deliver security awareness training. While traditional training may still be your mainstay, think of ways you could enliven it by adding some additional, innovative, and interactive training options.\nConsider how you might incorporate best practices into all your security awareness training efforts.\nRudimentary forms of training can be traced back to prehistoric times. Corporate training also has a long history. R. Hoe and Company is credited with offering the first form of workplace training back in 1872. You'd think we would have picked up some good best practices over the past 150 years. And we have.\n• Provide variety. Mix up your content delivery by incorporating a balance of lectures with interactive elements like quizzes, polls, group discussions, and simulations.\n• Incorporate gamification. People like competition. Augment training with competitions, leaderboards, rewards, and prizes.\n• Offer flexibility and variation. Employee learning preferences are varied; training offers should be, too.\n• Make it visually appealing — and modern. Today's employees are used to consuming information in highly visual, often entertaining formats — think YouTube and Instagram.\n• Make it relevant. Make sure it's clear to your employee learners why this information is important, and relevant, to them. Yes, it will benefit the organization. But what will they, personally, get out of it? Hint: employees have security-related concerns just like your organization does. How can this information help them protect their family data and devices?\n• Make it personalized. Don't create a one-size-fits-all training course because one size doesn't fit all. For instance, the information required by the IT staff will differ from that needed by employees in the marketing department. Don't force them to consume the same information.\n• Seek ongoing feedback from employees and managers to learn how training can be made more engaging and impactful. Do employees feel the training was relevant and enjoyable? Did they learn something? Are managers and supervisors seeing the information impacting behaviors?\n• Track progress continually — not just learner sentiment about the training but actual organizational impact. Has security awareness improved? Have incidents lessened or have reports increased? Have specific goals related to your cybersecurity awareness training and measure against those goals. Share results with employees, and thank them for their efforts in helping to achieve goals. Enlist their support to close identified gaps.\n• Commit to continuous improvement. Security awareness is a journey, not a destination. You will never achieve 100% success, but you can achieve incremental improvement over time.\nEmployee training fatigue is real. But it doesn't have to be a constraint on your training efforts. Think of ways you can approach training differently to better engage employees. What new methods and techniques will you implement to combat training fatigue?\n",

Click here for the full series page.\nWhen the iPhone came out in 2005, I wasn't among the first in line, but I did buy one. Two weeks later, surprised that my new device was doing exactly what it was designed to do—addicting me—I replaced it with a no-frills Nokia, which I used for the next thirteen years.\nThen, on January 15, 2018, I put my Nokia in a drawer forever. Why? Because I'm haunted by the image of myself looking at my phone to the exclusion of everything else around me. Mostly I remember resenting that a cartoonish cube of metal and glass had taken control of my life. The \"endless and proper work\" of paying attention is an essential part of the work I do. Why would I use something that compromised my ability to be great at my job?\nEven though I'm currently in my sixth year without a phone, I decided to reach out to Nir Eyal, named by The M.I.T. Technology Review as, \"The Prophet of Habit-Forming Technology,\" to try to get to the bottom of phone addiction and understand why we check our phones even though we haven't received any notifications.\nEyal is the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products and Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life, selling over 1 million copies in over 30 languages.\nThe conversation proved fascinating — despite our differences, I was amazed to find an astounding number of similarities. I also came away having learned a few tricks that I still use to this day.\nSay, for example, you're at a business dinner and one of the patrons is constantly looking down at their phone. Instead of ignoring them, Nir's strategy is to confront them with concern: ask them in a sincere way: \"I can see that you're on the phone a lot – is everything okay – is there anything I can do to help?\"\nAs we dug deeper towards the root question that inspired our sit down, Nir's explanations brought me back to my own decision to get rid of my phone. Our phones are a form of armor. A shield. A light saber. A one-handed defense against our own fear, anxiety, aloneness, self-consciousness, stillness, sadness, and insignificance. A notification means someone cares. It means that we're important.\nI get it.\nAnd yet, when I'm walking along the street and someone glued to his or her phone crashes into me, followed by a quick, rueful \"Sorry...\" I can't help feeling an irrational rage. \"Don't you understand what you're doing?\" I want to say. Is this really how you want to spend your one wild and precious life?\n",

        "content": "Editor's note: This column is part of 'Why Do We?' — a weekly video series hosted by culture expert Martin Lindstrom that untangles unique quirks of human behavior. Click here for the full series page.\nIt's not every day I get the chance to sit down with a Nobel laureate, but the challenging question raised by Newsweek left me no choice. Why do we procrastinate on taxes?\nWhether we like to admit it, we've all been there. Breaking up, fixing that dripping tap, learning that new skill — the list goes on. A friend of mine recently procrastinated on his health check, likely suspecting that the message he would receive wouldn't be rosy. According to a recent study, 20 to 25 percent of the adult population procrastinates regularly, while a staggering 70 to 95 percent of all students report procrastinating on academic tasks.\nAnd then there's that dreaded tax return hanging over our heads.\nSo I sat down with economist Richard Thaler — recipient of the 2017 Nobel Prize for his pioneering contributions to behavioral economics and best-selling author of the book, Nudge. Thaler's work fundamentally challenged the traditional economic assumption that individuals always act rationally, laying the groundwork for the concept of \"nudge theory.\" Since procrastination is itself irrational, Thaler seemed the perfect choice to help me get to the bottom of my quandary.\nFrom the onset, Thaler wasn't anything like what I was expecting from a Nobel laureate. Despite the seriousness of his work, I found Thaler fun and approachable. When I asked him about the Prize, he merely laughed and told me that he assumed the Nobel committee in Stockholm probably couldn't get hold of their first choice, so he got the call as a last minute stand-in. Despite his self-deprecatory nature, it didn't take more than a few minutes with Thaler to see his brilliant mind at work.\nBut back to taxes.\nDid you know that if you just inform the tax authorities that you'll be filing late, in most instances nothing will happen? But we choose instead to procrastinate, incurring penalties which could just as easily have been cleared up with a dose of candor and honesty!\nJoin my conversation with Richard Thaler where we cover everything from urinals, Richard's love affair with a sound button, and of course his take on why we procrastinate.\n",

        "content": "Newsweek's core mission is to provide our readers with a deep and nuanced understanding of the world around them. That means embracing a truly global perspective. We aim to transcend surface-level narratives, offering coverage that creates opportunities for true international dialogue.\nTo many, the 21st century is also known as the Asian Century. Asia will lead the world in this next phase of global economic growth. According to Goldman Sachs, by 2050, the world's GDP will be $227.9 trillion. Asia will represent the largest share of global GDP growth at $90.6 trillion, followed by the developed economies at $82.9 trillion and then the rest of the world.\nOur recent exclusive interviews with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, masterfully conducted by our team led by Global Editor-in-Chief Nancy Cooper, are the latest example of this commitment. In this context, I see our role at Newsweek as not merely passive observers but as active facilitators of meaningful dialogue around the future of Asia.\nAs an American who was born and lived the early part of my life in India, I have a nuanced perspective on India's challenges and aspirations. The country's relatively nascent sovereignty, having emerged only 75 years ago from centuries of colonial rule, is a testament to its resilience. The journey from its colonial past to a vibrant democracy is a narrative I hold close to my heart, and it drives my commitment to ensure that Newsweek covers India with the depth and nuance it deserves.\nCoverage of India by mainstream international media at times gravitates toward simplistic narratives that fail to capture the profound complexity and vibrant diversity of the world's most populous nation. Typically, the portrayal emphasizes either the booming IT and economic sectors or the persistent challenges such as poverty and social friction, leaving little room for the varied perspectives beyond and in between.\nSuch coverage can overlook the rich cultural tapestry, the internal innovations in various sectors, and the distinct political dynamics, all shaped by thousands of years of history, that today stand at the nexus of geopolitical change. The level of optimism and pride I'm seeing among Indians—friends, family, and colleagues—is truly inspiring and unlike anything I've experienced before. The global stage is set to witness a confident India, and if the Indian diaspora's contribution to the U.S., the UK, and elsewhere is a preview, the world stands to gain much from India's rising prominence.\nThat's why Newsweek's interview with Prime Minister Modi and the associated story was not just a recitation of current events: Our coverage delved into the complex dynamics of India's geopolitical relationships and their broader implications for global affairs.\nModi's remarks to Newsweek on the Indo-China border disputes and his call for urgent resolution resonated globally, sparking reactions from major geopolitical players, including a direct response from the Chinese government. The response was immediate and extensive, with major news outlets like Bloomberg and BBC amplifying the discussion. The reaction from China was particularly significant, and its Foreign Ministry spokesperson highlighted hopes for diplomatic progress. This international engagement underscores the relevance of Newsweek's efforts and reaffirms our role in fostering meaningful global dialogue.\nA few weeks after our interview with Prime Minister Modi, we met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo. There, too, we gained fresh insights into the thoughts of a significant national leader and his approach to his country's challenges and opportunities.\nThe interview explored the country's pressing need for stronger partnerships with the U.S. and other regional allies to address what he described as \"the most challenging and complex security environment since the end of World War II,\" a situation exacerbated by recent military activities by China and North Korea. Throughout the interview, he frequently emphasized the term \"peace,\" underscoring Japan's intent to be assertive yet remain a peace-loving nation, obeying international rules.\nIt's our view that building a successful digital media company with global relevance today involves understanding political, economic, and social dynamics and committing to comprehensive reporting that resonates at the global stage and captures the evolution of the global order. In that respect, our recent India and Japan coverage serves as a kind of blueprint for Newsweek's global future. The impact of our interviews with Prime Minister Modi and Prime Minister Kishida and the accompanying stories highlights the critical role of media in international relations and democracy, reinforcing our commitment to journalism that not only reports but also enlightens.\n",

        "content": "Today, news media faces a number of structural challenges: deepening polarization, diminishing trust and a stark decline in reader engagement.\nAt Newsweek, we've delved deeply into the forces driving us here. One way we're addressing these concerns is the Fairness Meter, which allows readers to hold us accountable by rating an article's fairness on a five-way scale. Our fairness meter can be found at the bottom of select articles across Newsweek's editorial content and will help maintain a high standard of integrity, transparency, and accountability.\nThe landscape of polarization and eroding trust\nMedia's increasing polarization owes much to the dominance of social media, but the challenges began even before that with the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987.\nThis policy, which mandated the inclusion of diverse viewpoints, once ensured a breadth of perspectives in broadcast journalism — a formal balance that lent fairness and credibility to the format. Its removal marked the first shift toward what we see today: more extreme and polarized media narratives. Gallup's polls from 2021 and 2022 show that only 34% of Americans trust mass media, with a pronounced partisan divide — 70% of Democrats versus a mere 14% of Republicans trust mass media outlets.\nThis erosion of trust in news media is not an isolated phenomenon. It's part of a broader moment in which public confidence in many institutions has been waning. In an age when misinformation can spread rapidly over social media, the role of responsible media in providing accurate and unbiased information has become more important than ever. We must do what we can to restore this trust, and it begins at the core of the news product.\nChanging dynamics of reader participation\nParallel to the issue of trust is the evolution of reader participation. The digital age has transformed how audiences interact with news content.\nPost-2016 trends indicate a decline in engagement with traditional news outlets, particularly among younger demographics. Young people increasingly bypass traditional news platforms, turning instead to social media feeds and other digital channels for their news and information.\nThis shift has significant implications for how news organizations engage with their audiences and maintain relevance in the digital era.\nThe Fairness Meter\nNewsweek's Fairness Meter is one of our responses. First, it represents a commitment to deepening trust and enhancing reader engagement by involving our audience in the direct evaluation of our content. Second, the tool redefines the more traditional comment-based systems, instead opting for a structured and consistent way for readers to express their views on the fairness of our articles, providing a concrete method for readers to help shape and sharpen our journalistic tenets.\nHere's some of what we've learned after placing the Fairness Meter on over 1,000 stories since it was activated in September 2023.\nThe aspirations of the Fairness Meter aim to go beyond just gauging perceptions of fairness. It's one step in the direction of restoring trust in the relationship between the public and the news media.\nRepatriating news engagement to the news property\nOver time, social media has usurped news organizations as the forum for discussion and debate of news and current events. One byproduct has been the formation of information echo chambers, which often come to confirm the existing biases of different groupings of users. Social platforms — with finely tuned algorithms designed to amplify engagement — frequently prioritize sensational and controversial content, perspectives and comments, fueling what could be referred to as \"enragement engagement.\"\nThis shift has effectively taken over much of the discourse that was once a feature of news platforms. The Fairness Meter is an initiative to bring back reader engagement to the news platform itself.\nThe end of the ivory tower: A call for public accountability\nThe modern media landscape needs a fundamental shift in how news outlets address reader perceptions and engagement. The era of the journalistic \"ivory tower\" — where media outlets operate in isolation from their audience — is over. Today's media must open itself up to public accountability. The Fairness Meter is one way of demonstrating this new approach, allowing readers to actively participate in shaping the stories our journalists report on.\nIgnoring the imperative for engagement and transparency comes with significant risks. The decline in public trust and reader engagement on news platforms is a clear signal. This growing distrust, exacerbated by digital echo chambers and social media-fueled confirmation biases, threatens the foundation of credible journalism.\nThe Fairness Meter is not merely a feedback tool; it fosters dialogue and understanding and demonstrates respect for our audience's intelligence, acknowledging their critical role in shaping the way that we in the media work.\nOriginally published on Poynter.org\n",

        "content": "In the annals of American broadcast journalism, the Fairness Doctrine stands as a testament to a time when balanced reporting was more than a noble pursuit; it was a mandated practice.\nThe policy, established by the Federal Communications Commission in 1949, obligated broadcasters to present contrasting viewpoints on contentious public issues.\nThis era of regulated balance came to an end in 1987 when President Ronald Reagan's FCC decided that the increasing diversity of media outlets meant the doctrine was no longer required. This pivotal shift laid the groundwork for significant transformations in the media landscape.\nIn the post-Fairness Doctrine era, we have witnessed an unprecedented polarization of American media. Freed from the obligation to present differing perspectives, many media outlets have defaulted to presenting narratives through a singular ideological lens.\nThe end of the Fairness Doctrine isn't the sole cause of media polarization, of course. The advent of social media and the algorithm-driven delivery of news, coupled with business incentives that prioritize engagement over balance, have exacerbated the divide. The outrage economy is a self-perpetuating system.\nThese shifts have profoundly affected our democratic society. Public discourse, once anchored in a commonly accepted set of facts, has fractured into micro-environments, subsets and cohorts, each espousing its unique version of reality. This accelerates the erosion of civil dialogue, undermining a critical component of our democracy. In this polarized media landscape, trust in the so-called fourth estate has plummeted to an all-time low.\nSocial media platforms, with their indiscriminate blending of content from trusted news outlets and dubious blogs, have furthered this erosion.\nThe shift towards subscription-based business models is a double-edged sword. While it has provided a lifeline to many media organizations in the face of shrinking advertising revenues, it has also inadvertently deepened the echo chambers. By prioritizing content that affirms their subscribers' worldviews, media outlets perpetuate these bubbles. And with quality journalism often locked behind paywalls, the information divide grows wider, further threatening the democratic ideal of an informed citizenry.\nIn the face of these challenges, it's crucial to remember that the principles of the Fairness Doctrine, though no longer legally enforced, needn't be abandoned. Instead, we should strive to voluntarily integrate these principles into our journalistic practices. By emphasizing fairness, balance and a representation of diverse viewpoints in our reporting, we can begin to counteract the rampant polarization that currently plagues our media and, by extension, our public discourse.\nNavigating today's media landscape is challenging. It's shaped by a web of social, technological and economic factors that defy easy solutions. Meanwhile, the erosion of civil dialogue, the declining trust in media, and the fragmentation of our public discourse pose serious threats to our democracy.\nWe need to raise our journalistic standards. Both-sides-ism isn't fairness — it's a failure of critical thinking or intellectual honesty. Let's not be naive: There are people and interests who deliberately skew our public discourse through misdirection, false equivalence and outright lies. We must counter those pernicious efforts by demanding a commitment to good-faith debate, which will pay dividends in rebuilding the trust that across the spectrum of ideas.\nAdopting a voluntary commitment to the principles embodied in the Fairness Doctrine represents a step in the right direction. It signals our dedication to upholding the ethical tenets of journalism, our respect for diverse viewpoints and our unwavering commitment to nourishing an informed and balanced public discourse.\nWhen fairness is no longer a doctrine, it must become a practice. Our democracy, in its present state, urgently requires this shift. For the media industry, it's not just a question of ethical responsibility but an existential imperative. The very health of our democratic society might depend on it.\nOriginally published on Poynter.org\n",
