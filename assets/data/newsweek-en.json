        "content": "The homeownership rate for Gen Zers between the ages of 19 and 25 is higher than those for millennials and Gen Xers when they were the same age, according to a recent Redfin report.\nIn 2023, when the housing market saw a nationwide correction followed by a rebounding of prices across the country, 26.3 percent of adult Gen Zers owned a home, a slight uptick from 26.2 percent the year before, the report said. The homeownership rates among millennials and Gen Xers in 2023 were 54.8 percent and 72 percent, respectively—up from 52 percent and 70.5 percent in 2022.\nRead more: Find the Lowest Rates From Top Mortgage Lenders\nThough millennials and Gen Xers counted more homeowners among their ranks overall, the report found that Gen Zers were faring much better now than the two older generations did at their age.\nIn 2023, the homeownership rate among 24-year-old Gen Zers was 27.8 percent. When millennials were 24, their homeownership rate was 24.5 percent. And 23.5 percent of Gen Xers were homeowners at age 24.\nAccording to the report, \"The only Gen Zers who are tracking behind prior generations are 26-year-olds, who were the oldest Gen Zers.\" In 2024, that group had a homeownership rate of 30 percent, below the 31 percent for millennials and 32.5 percent for Gen Xers who owned homes at age 26.\nRead more: How to Buy a House With Bad Credit\n\"Some Gen Zers took advantage of record-low mortgage rates during the pandemic and bought a home earlier than the previous generations were able to,\" Daryl Fairweather, Redfin's chief economist, told Newsweek.\nWhen millennials were in their 20s, many struggled to find employment following the Great Recession, the financial crisis of 2007-2008, making it harder to save enough to buy a home. When Gen Xers were in their 20s, the U.S. housing market was navigating some of the highest mortgage rates in history. In 1989, rates were around 11 percent, Redfin reported.\n\"But now that mortgage rates are high, Gen Z isn't any better poised to buy a home than millennials were at their age,\" Fairweather said.\nThe situation for Gen Z has changed drastically since March 2022, when the Federal Reserve approved its first interest-rate hike in more than three years. In the following months, the central bank continued its aggressive rate-hiking campaign to stop the rise of inflation, which ended in December.\nRead more: First-Time Homebuyer Guide\nThe interest-rate hikes led to a surge in mortgage rates that made buying a home unaffordable for many and led to homeowners holding on to their properties for longer than they may have previously planned. While the situation affects everyone trying to buy a home in the U.S., Fairweather said \"high mortgage rates have made buying a home especially unaffordable for first-time homebuyers, such as Gen Zers.\"\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n",

        "content": "Police in riot gear stormed a Columbia University building and forcefully arrested pro-Palestinian protesters on Tuesday, videos posted online appear to show.\nThe protesters had occupied Hamilton Hall, an academic building, in the early hours of Tuesday morning in an escalation of the demonstrations against Israel's war in Gaza.\nHundreds of New York Police Department officers entered Columbia's campus on Tuesday night, with photos and videos showing them using a tactical vehicle to enter an upper floor of Hamilton Hall through a window.\nOfficers used hammers to gain entry into some rooms and drew weapons as they entered, according to videos posted on X, formerly Twitter, by NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Operations Kaz Daughtry.\nVideos posted online showed officers shoving and dragging protesters. One protester could be seen falling down a set of steps outside Hamilton Hall.\nThe Columbia Daily Spectator student newspaper reported that one protester lay unmoving on the ground outside Hamilton Hall as officers stood over them, before three officers carried that person away from the building.\nNYPD spokesperson Carlos Nieves told press sources he had no immediate reports of any injuries. Newsweek has contacted the NYPD for further comment via email.\nA statement from a Columbia spokesperson said officers entered the campus shortly after 9 p.m. at the university's request. \"After the university learned overnight that Hamilton Hall had been occupied, vandalized, and blockaded, we were left with no choice,\" the spokesperson said.\nThe decision to bring in the NYPD \"was in response to the actions of the protesters, not the cause they are championing,\" the spokesperson added. \"We have made it clear that the life of campus cannot be endlessly interrupted by protesters who violate the rules and the law.\"\nTHIS IS THE SCENE @COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY AND THE NYPD DID NOT WANT YOU TO SEE. THIS IS WHY THEY FORCED EVERYONE OUT. POLICE USED TASERS & TEAR GAS ON STUDENTS. YOU CAN HEAR SCREAMING AT THE END. WE STILL DON’T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE INSIDE THE BUILDING. https://t.co/Kmx6gweNBJ\nFootage of NYPD tactical teams raiding and clearing Columbia University. pic.twitter.com/roUe9Dp7Vb\nIn a letter to NYPD Deputy Commissioner Michael Gerber, Columbia President Minouche Shafik said the university was requesting that police remove protesters from Hamilton Hall and an encampment on the campus \"with the utmost regret.\"\nHer letter requested the NYPD's presence on campus through at least May 17, the end of the university's commencement events, to \"maintain order and ensure encampments are not re-established.\"\nColumbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), the group behind the encampment, wrote on X that the university administration \"would rather militarize its community than divest from the genocidal State of Israel.\"\nAFTER LOCKING MEDICS INTO JOHN JAY, NYPD AT COLUMBIA PUSHED THREE STUDENTS DOWN THE STAIRS AND DRAGGED OUT ONE PASSED OUT STUDENT. THEY THREW ALL ITEMS DOWN THE STAIRS, ENDANGERING STUDENTS, AND PUSHED A GROUP OF FIVE THAT WERE WALKING WITHOUT RESISTING ARREST. pic.twitter.com/pt6KoY1UqL\nThe Columbia chapter of the American Association of University Professors condemned the decision to call in police, saying that the university's administration has repeatedly ignored faculty's efforts to help defuse the situation.\n\"Armed police entering our campus places students and everyone else on campus at risk,\" a statement said. \"That is why University statutes require consultation with faculty—statutes which appear to have been ignored since April 17, and again tonight. We hold University leadership responsible for the disastrous lapses of judgment that have gotten us to this point. The University President, her senior staff, and the Board of Trustees will bear responsibility for any injuries that may occur during any police action on our campus.\"\nStudent protesters set up a \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment\" on Columbia's campus almost two weeks ago, called on the university to cut financial ties to Israel and companies they say are profiting from Israel's offensive in Gaza.\nIt began after Hamas launched a deadly attack on southern Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking roughly 250 hostages. Since then, Israel has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in Gaza, The Associated Press reported, citing the local health ministry.\nColumbia officials called in police to clear the encampment a day after it was set up. More than 100 protesters were arrested, but the students soon returned to rebuild the encampment and inspired students across the country to set up similar encampments.\nAfter negotiations between Columbia officials and the protesters broke down, the school set a Monday afternoon deadline for protesters to leave the encampment or be suspended.\nProtesters defied the ultimatum and occupied Hamilton Hall early Tuesday, renaming the building Hind's Hall in honor of Hind Rajab, a 6-year-old Palestinian girl who was found dead, after reportedly making pleas for help to first responders, during Israel's offensive in Gaza. They said they would remain in the building until their demands for divestment, financial transparency and amnesty were met.\nIn the past two weeks, police have swept through several other campuses, leading to more than 1,000 arrests nationwide. But in some cases, universities have come to agreements with protesters.\nThe events at Columbia on Tuesday came on the 56th anniversary of a similar clearing of an occupation of Hamilton Hall by civil rights and anti-Vietnam War protesters in 1968.\nAnd they unfolded as the NYPD was also called in to quell protests at The City College of New York, part of the City University of New York (CUNY) system. Videos showed protesters in a standoff with officers outside the college's main gate, just blocks away from Columbia, and officers shoving some as they cleared people from the street and sidewalks.\nIn a statement, CUNY said that a large crowd of demonstrators had marched from Columbia University to the City College campus.\nCUNY public safety staff handled the initial response, arresting 25 individuals, the statement said, but \"as the crowd grew in size, CUNY and CCNY leadership made the difficult decision to request NYPD assistance.\" The NYPD arrested \"a number of individuals,\" the statement added.\nIn a message to the college community, City College President Vince Boudreau said all campus operations would be online from Wednesday until further notice.\nUpdated 5/1/24, 4 a.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.\nCorrection 5/1/24, 8:58 a.m. ET: This article has been updated with a correction to Columbia University Apartheid Divest's name.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n",

Over the same period, the number of encounters increased across both Arizona and California.\nThis is a significant win for Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who has introduced several measures to combat illegal immigration, including the deployment of thousands of National Guard troops and installing razor wire along the border. On April 12, Abbott said that 507,200 suspected undocumented migrants had been detained in his state since 2021 when he launched Operation Lone Star to combat illegal crossings.\nIn the El Paso region of Texas, 30,420 law enforcement-migrant encounters were recorded in the 2024 fiscal year through March, a 24.1 percent decrease from the same period in the 2023 fiscal year, when 40,103 encounters were registered by CBP.\nDuring the same time, CBP data shows encounters in Big Bend plummeted 63.7 percent, from 1,200 to 436, while those in Del Rio dropped 52.8 percent, from 23,904 to 11,281.\nThe 2024 fiscal year through March also saw encounters in Laredo and Rio Grande Valley fall by 42.8 percent and 49.5 percent, respectively, as opposed to the same period in 2023. In Laredo, the total dipped from 5,210 to 2,978, while Rio Grande Valley declined from 17,956 to 9,065.\nThe number of law enforcement encounters is widely used as a rough proxy for the rate of irregular immigration, especially as many migrants voluntarily turn themselves in to law enforcement to claim asylum.\nNoticeably, however, while migrant encounters fell across all five regions of Texas, they increased in Arizona and California, both of which are governed by Democrats.\nThe CBP data divides Arizona into two sectors, Tucson and Yuma. In Tucson, the number of encounters rose 23.7 percent, to 41,941, in the 2024 fiscal year through March, against 33,898 during the same period in 2023. While the figure fell by 57.1 percent in the Yuma region, from 13,667 to 5,865, this still left a net increase across the state.\nSimilarly in California, the San Diego sector recorded a 45.1 percent increase, from 23,286 encounters to 33,784 over this period, more than compensating for the drop in neighboring El Centro, from 4,448 to 1,710.\nControl over irregular immigration has become a heated political issue with former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, making tighter controls a central pillar of his bid for a second White House term. According to CBP, there were 9.8 million interactions between law enforcement and suspected illegal migrants from October 2019 to January 2024.\nSpeaking to Newsweek in February, Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake, who unsuccessfully ran for the Arizona governorship in 2022, claimed Abbott's border policies were causing an influx of migrants into her state.\n\"Because Greg Abbott is now working to secure the border in Texas, we're seeing an influx of people pouring across our border, even more so than we had in previous months,\" Lake said.\nNewsweek contacted the press office of Abbott for comment via email.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n",

In the written order, the judge stated that although the software used for the enhancement was popular in the commercial market, it had not been peer reviewed nor independently tested for reliability, and the algorithms underlying it were \"opaque and proprietary.\"\nNews like this leaves the impression that the judiciary is carefully monitoring the use of AI-generated evidence in criminal cases, but in reality, nothing could be further from the truth. When an analyst cannot interpret a crime scene DNA sample, it's now routine for prosecutors to introduce results generated by AI probabilistic genotyping software. And courts accept such evidence, often even dismissing out of hand arguments by defense lawyers that such software and its underlying algorithms remain—to paraphrase the Washington judge—opaque, proprietary, and untested by independent experts. The same can be said for location data evidence generated by tools powered by AI, as well as information gleaned from AI facial recognition tools, even though we know such data can be faulty and at least six people have been wrongfully arrested or jailed as a result.\nEven more alarmingly, judges and defendants do not always have an opportunity to test such evidence because law enforcement frequently hides its use of AI software from courts and the public. Investigators have made arrests after combing through recreational DNA databases or using DNA to generate supposed facial images, without disclosing those searches as the basis for the identification. Alerts from AI gunshot detection software have justified the deployment of police to scenes, and even have been upheld by courts as providing a legal basis to briefly detain and question people. Never mind that one study found that 90 percent of alerts turned up no corroboration, led to three men being falsely imprisoned, and propelled thousands of unnecessary stop and frisks in predominantly Black and brown neighborhoods.\nWhat distinguishes the Washington case is not the use of AI—it is that the AI-based evidence was excluded after careful scrutiny by the court. That scrutiny might be explainable by another recurrent pattern in criminal cases: namely that forensic techniques offered by the defense are carefully picked apart, while forensic methods offered by the government skate by unexamined. Perhaps the most famous forensic exclusion of all time was polygraph evidence offered by a defendant in a case called Frye, which then set the standard for judicial review of all scientific evidence. Tellingly, however, Frye and its federal counterpart have routinely failed to preclude dubious methods, sloppy work, and overclaiming testimony—so long as it is offered by the government. That is why scandals routinely pop up in the field of forensic science, such as the recent announcement that a DNA analyst in Colorado had manipulated data in at least 652 cases over a 15 year period, or the publication in 2009 of a report by the National Academy of Sciences that concluded that familiar methods like field testing of drugs, firearm or bullet identification, and hair or bite analysis all lacked a firm scientific basis.\nGiven the checkered history of forensic evidence, it is in fact refreshing to see a court give it more careful attention. But even that is not enough.\nOur current systems of justice—and in particular our procedural and evidentiary rules—were created for the 19th century, not the 21st. They assume that the evidence is a self-evident, discrete piece of information that can be physically handed over and fully assessed and reviewed by a lawyer, judge, or jury on its own terms. The scrutiny that sophisticated AI technologies require in order to safeguard their integrity requires much more—like mandatory disclosure of the use of AI in any aspect of the case; access to the algorithms and inputs, not just outputs; the assistance of experts; disclosure of quality assurance and systems integrity measures; special scrutiny of methods created for, sold to, and deployed primarily for law enforcement purposes; and so on. As with all aspects of our lives, AI is coming whether we like it or not. It is time for our rules of justice to catch up.\nErin Murphy is Norman Dorsen professor of civil liberties at New York University School of Law.\nThe views expressed in this article are the writer's own.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n",

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI)'s emergence and stunning popularity in the legal sphere raises the question of whether it's ethical for lawyers to use AI tools in their practices. There is little doubt that AI, like all technology, can be misused. Attorneys citing non-existing cases is but one well-known example.\nInnovation has created challenges for the law before. Attorneys were skeptical about technological advances such as electronic legal research and e-discovery, yet those issues have largely been mitigated and are integral to law practice. Artificial intelligence is here to stay, so it's up to leaders in law to help establish guidelines that ensure AI tools remain ethical. This month, the New York State Bar Association issued a 92-page report on the use of AI in law practice, highlighting many of the challenges and providing recommendations and guidelines to avoid issues.\nAttorneys Are Using Multiple Types of AI, Some Better Than Others\nAI use in litigation is widely debated because so many AI tools are available, and there must be more understanding of best practices. Lawyers need to understand the most popular types of artificial intelligence for litigation efforts to uphold legal ethics: generative AI and predictive AI.\nGenerative AI produces new data in all forms of media, including text, code, images, audio, video, and more, based on a provided prompt. Its use of unstructured data generates new and original content. For lawyers, this type of AI can support the generation of legal documents and contracts and client services with legal chatbots for website support.\nLawyers can get in trouble with this use of generative AI. Litigators have been caught using AI-generated case citations in legal documents that ended up being bogus, a pitfall of generative AI and its emphasis on creating new content.\nPredictive AI uses machine learning to identify patterns within large datasets and predict future events/outcomes. Some of the data is traditional legal information, case outcomes, and types of cases. But, as with any big data project, it also includes data that doesn't have an obvious relationship to legal precedent.\nUsing this approach plus behavioral analytics opens opportunities that are inaccessible through researching case law. Now, attorneys can predict human behavior.\nPredictive AI is becoming a powerful tool that arms legal teams with intelligence beyond case law and extensive research in half the time, allowing them to better strategize for risk exposure, litigation likelihoods, settlement strategy, and more.\nAI Arms Lawyers and Their Clients To Assess Judicial Temperament and Its Effect on Their Case\nPreviously, attorneys seeking to assess a particular judge's likelihood of granting their motions relied on parsing basic statistics. This method only offers a rudimentary understanding of the judge's decision-making.\nIn this regard, predictive AI tools offer a competitive advantage. Rather than just analyzing the basic statistics, this approach collects massive amounts of data that would overwhelm an attorney. Data collection on a judge's previous motions for similar cases is a must, but data points on a judge's background can help predict judicial temperament. The data on where a judge went to law school, their political affiliation, gender, net worth, and other biographical information creates a more comprehensive outline of their personality. Predictive algorithmic models, behavioral analytics, and AI do the work to identify authentic patterns that demonstrate judicial predilections that correlate with the case at hand. This approach provides highly accurate predictions about how the judge will rule and how long cases will resolve.\nJudges' behavioral analytics are essential for lawyers and clients alike. This data offers proof points on how successful litigation efforts will be and how long they expect to be in court, which are details any paying legal customer has a right to have. These predictions are necessary for attorneys to have critical information informing settlement decisions, motion practice, and risk assessment. Ignoring these metrics places clients at a disadvantage and likely raises ethical issues.\nA Blanket Ban on AI Use in Courts Is Too Simplistic and Unrealistic\nAI isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Banning legal AI use would be a lazy approach to sophisticated and complicated technology that is only growing in prominence. Litigators must take a hybrid approach of checks and balances when using AI tools to set the U.S. court system up for success with AI-powered technology. It's up to lawyers to oversee any work done by AI for completeness and accuracy, ensuring the data used by the AI tool is sound and that the output—either generative or predictive—is appropriate for the case at hand.\nAI should be used to better society, enable people to do their jobs with fewer limits, and allow them to better practice law, write briefs, and advise clients.

        "content": "Ukraine will start operating F-16s after Orthodox Easter on May 5, Kyiv has said, as the country contends with devastating Russian bombardment and the long wait for the Western-made fighter jets.\n\"We are waiting,\" Ukrainian air force spokesperson Ilya Yevlash said, adding the jets will be taking to the skies over the war-torn country \"after Easter,\" according to remarks reported by Ukrainian media on Wednesday.\nA number of Ukraine's Western backers—Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Belgium—have pledged to supply Lockheed Martin-made F-16 aircraft to Ukraine.\nKyiv has long requested the advanced jets to upgrade and replenish its air force, battered by more than two years of war against Russia's superior and more numerous aircraft. Russia has used its aircraft, flying outside of the reach of Ukraine's air defenses, to launch devastating aerial guided bomb strikes on Ukraine.\nBut uncertainty has persisted about just when Kyiv will get hold of F-16s and have the aircraft operational against Russian forces, the timelines plagued by vagueness and delays.\nHold-ups in sending the jets have played against Ukraine. Experts previously told Newsweek that Russia has likely made use of the months since the donations of F-16s were announced to prepare.\nIn April, an anonymous Ukrainian senior military officer told Politico that \"F-16s were needed in 2023; they won't be right for 2024.\"\nBefore the jets take off in Ukraine, Western countries say, Ukrainian personnel must complete their training programs, and the necessary infrastructure and facilities must be up and running in the country.\nThe Danish ambassador to Ukraine, Ole Egberg Mikkelsen, told outlet RBC-Ukraine on Tuesday that \"it's not only a question of the aircraft, that's just one part of it.\"\n\"I'm optimistic, I'm sure that they will arrive soon,\" he added.\nThe F-16s were slated to arrive in the first part of 2024, but the Dutch government announced in January that Ukraine would receive an initial batch in the \"second quarter\" of the year.\nBelgian Defense Minister Ludivine Dedonder said late last month that Belgium would \"do everything possible\" to deliver F-16s to Ukraine by the end of 2024. The jets were scheduled to arrive in the country in 2025.\n\"This year, more than a squadron of donated F-16s will start to arrive in Ukraine, along with pilots and maintainers\" trained by Ukraine's backers, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said in late April.\nUkraine's Yevlash said earlier this week that Kyiv would welcome non-functional F-16s, whose parts could be used to repair and maintain the operational fleet.\nUpdate 5/1/2024, 6:52 a.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n",

Ukraine frequently zeros in on Russian military bases, and has upped attacks on Russia's oil refineries in recent months.\nThe Kushchevskaya airfield hosts Su-34 and Su-35 aircraft, the British Defense Ministry said on Tuesday. Footage widely circulated online appeared to show the destruction of glide bomb kits at the site.\n\"Russian fighters, from Kushchevskaya and a number of other air bases, typically conduct 100 to 150 sorties per day, a significant percentage of those launching munitions all along the frontlines as Russia attempts to force breakthroughs through sheer firepower,\" the U.K. government said.\nThe jets have bombarded the front lines with adapted bombs, upgraded from \"dumb\" munitions to weapons fitted with guidance and glide kits. The heavy and more accurate bombs can be launched from outside the range of Ukraine's air defenses—an already scarce resource for Kyiv in the past few months.\nUkraine's ability to interfere with Russia's tactical air power, particularly its devastating use of glide bombs, is crucial for the defense of the wider front lines, the British Defense Ministry said.\n\"This successful strike is likely to force further Russian dispersals of fighters as well as reallocation of air defence assets to plug gaps,\" it said.\nNewsweek has reached out to the Russian Defense Ministry for comment via email.\nUkraine has previously struck Russian air bases on the Moscow-controlled Crimean Peninsula, including at the key northern Crimean hub town of Dzhankoy.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n",

The total for the last week hit 7,980, for a daily average of 1,140.\nRussian losses increased in the second half of April amid a push in the Donetsk region, following Moscow's capture of the town of Avdiivka in February, as Kyiv awaits the delivery of military assistance recently approved by U.S. Congress.\nIn March, there were more than 1,000 losses in a day on nine occasions, 13 times in February, and only four times in January. The latest tally by Kyiv puts total Russian losses over the 797 days of the war at 469,840, for a daily mean of 560. Newsweek has contacted the Russian defense ministry for comment.\nThe Ukrainian defense ministry describes the figures as \"approximate\" and they include both killed and injured. Ukraine itself is tight-lipped on its own losses, with President Volodymyr Zelensky revealing in February that 31,000 of his troops had been killed, although other estimates are higher.\nWhile Russia has not updated its casualty figures since September 2022 when defense minister Sergei Shoigu said just under 6,000 had been killed, an accurate estimate of the number of personnel lost in Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion is difficult to ascertain.\nOn April 27, the British Secretary of State for the Armed Forces Leo Docherty said Moscow's personnel losses had reached 450,000, which like the Ukrainian figure, includes those who have been killed or wounded.\nThe previous day, the independent Russian media outlet Mediazona, along with BBC Russian, said they could confirm that 51,679 Russian soldiers had been killed in the war, an increase of 1,208 since its last update in mid-April.\nHowever, the outlets say the tally, which includes over 3,400 officers, was likely to be an underestimate because the figures were drawn only from publicly available sources, such as obituaries and online notices.\nIt comes as the Ukrainian General Staff said that Russian forces had not made any confirmed advances in the Avdiivka area on Tuesday as Moscow bears down on the town of Chasiv Yar, which Kyiv has warned Vladimir Putin wants to capture in time for the Victory Day celebrations on May 9.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n",

        "content": "Meghan Markle is bypassing Britain, leaving Prince Harry to attend an Invictus Games anniversary service in London alone on May 8, but she will join her husband for a visit to Nigeria later this month, it has been announced.\nThe reason for the duchess' planned absence from the Invictus service, which will take place at St. Paul's Cathedral, has not been given. However, as a new episode of Newsweek's The Royal Report podcast has discussed, her complex relationship with the U.K. and prospect of leaving her children are likely factors that have been taken into consideration. Newsweek approached representatives of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle via email for comment.\nThe last time Meghan visited Britain publicly was in September 2022 at the time of Queen Elizabeth II's funeral and prior to that was in the summer of the same year for the Platinum Jubilee celebrations.\n\"The centerpiece of this visit is a service of Thanksgiving for Invictus at St. Paul's Cathedral,\" chief royal correspondent, Jack Royston, told Royal Report listeners of Harry's incoming trip.\n\"Now the last time Meghan went there, Meghan and Harry were booed by royalists. That was during Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee. There were cheers as well, but there were certainly boos, and that was during a similar service of Thanksgiving.\"\nNoting that the duchess may wish to avoid a repeat of such a reception, Royston said that, by contrast, she is guaranteed a warmer reception in Nigeria, where the duke and duchess have accepted an invitation to visit, again connected with the Invictus Games.\n\"By contrast, Meghan will obviously get a very positive welcome in Nigeria,\" Royston said. \"So, she may simply be choosing guaranteed good PR over the possibility of another moment of hubris at the hands of monarchists who don't really like her very much.\n\"Meghan has generally been a great supporter of Invictus,\" he added. \"She's continued to attend the tournaments, and also not just the actual games themselves, but the 'one year to go' promotional events, too. So, why not this one in Britain, especially since it's a whole program marking the 10-year anniversary? It's a long time until it's going to be the 20-year anniversary. You'd think that she would want to be there.\"\nThe answer to this, Royston said, is likely to be linked to a number of reasons, from a desire to protect her personal peace to family and security concerns.\n\"It could genuinely be as simple as the fact that Britain probably holds some pretty difficult memories for her,\" Royston added. \"She obviously didn't enjoy her time working for the monarchy and she also has had a really hard time with the British press, to put it mildly. I kind of do understand why she might just look at the whole situation and think, 'Well, you didn't exactly show me lots of love. So why should I show you lots of love?'\n\"Also, on a more emotional front,\" he added, \"going away for long periods of time is difficult as a parent, because you have to leave your kids behind.\n\"Presumably, it's not impossible, I suppose, that they could take Archie and Lilibet with them, but they may not want to… Harry and Meghan don't have guaranteed police protection in Britain anymore, so they may simply feel that the country isn't safe for the whole family.\"\nHarry's legal battle to have his full-time, government-funded bodyguards, which he lost when he stepped down as a working member of the royal family in 2020, is ongoing.\nEarlier this year, a judge ruled that the government body that made the decision to remove his security did so legally. The prince is appealing the judgment.\nWhen he visits Britain, Harry is afforded security by the government, but it is on a case-by-case basis and will vary, depending on the reason for his visit.\nNo dates for the duke and duchess' visit to Nigeria have yet been confirmed. During their time in the country, they are expected to take part in cultural activities and events connected with the Invictus Games, which Nigeria first competed in as a nation in 2023.\nJames Crawford-Smith is Newsweek's royal reporter, based in London.

It has taken me time to recover from major surgery in order to start my treatment.\n\"But, most importantly, it has taken us time to explain everything to George, Charlotte and Louis in a way that is appropriate for them, and to reassure them that I am going to be OK.\n\"As I have said to them; I am well and getting stronger every day by focusing on the things that will help me heal; in my mind, body and spirits,\" Kate added.\nThat was a little less than a month after the princess began her course of chemotherapy, which she said was still \"in the early stages of that treatment.\"\nAt the time of Kate's announcement, a Kensington Palace spokesperson in London said: \"The Princess will return to official duties when she is cleared to do so by her medical team. She is in good spirits and is focused on making a full recovery.\"\nA Kensington Palace news release about William's visit read: \"James' Place was founded in 2008 by Clare Milford Haven and Nick Wentworth-Stanley following the tragic death of their son James.\n\"Aged just 21, James took his own life 10 days after a minor operation, after being unable to find the urgent help he so desperately needed for his anxiety and suicidal thoughts.\n\"Clare and Nick were determined to prevent other families from losing the men they love and set up the charity to help men in suicidal crisis,\" the news release added.\n\"Suicide is the single leading cause of death for men under 35, with men three times more likely than women to die by suicide in the U.K.\"\nIf you or someone you know is considering suicide, contact the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline by dialing 988, text \"988\" to the Crisis Text Line at 741741 or go to 988lifeline.org.\nJack Royston is Newsweek's chief royal correspondent based in London.

        "content": "In the winter of 1969, during the frigid spring semester at the University of Minnesota, a coalition of Black students staged a sit-in protest at Morrill Hall, occupying the office of the bursar and records for almost twenty-four hours.\nLed by Afro-American Action Committee (AAAC) President Rosemary Freeman, a sophomore, and one of only eighty-seven Black students on a campus of 40,000, the organization had communicated their grievances and demands for institutional changes several times previously.\nFreeman was originally from Browning, Mississippi, an all-Black community created by a group of ex-slaves shortly after the Civil War. She first came to activism as a high school student working to register Black voters in the south under Martin Luther King Jr. She'd been previously jailed for her participation in voter registration and was therefore no stranger to contentious political situations.\nThe assassinations of Dr. King and then Robert Kennedy in 1968 intensified the AAAC's desire to call the university to action. Among other things, they wanted the institution to foster diversity on campus via scholarships for local Black high school students and the creation of an African American Studies department.\nUniversity of Minnesota President Malcolm Moos, previously radio silent in response to the committee's outreach, negotiated a common ground to end the protest by the deadline. And thanks to the action of the AAAC, an African American Studies department was created and the university opened its doors more readily to local Black talent.\nIn February 2019, the University's Department of African American and African Studies celebrated the fiftieth reunion of the protest with teach-ins at the student union, the first time for a public reckoning of the events of 1969.\nRosemary Freeman, along with John Wright, Horace Huntley, and Warren Tucker Jr., are rarely known. As the AAAC president and, as she tells it, the one who leveled the playing field between herself and President Moos by greeting him in his own office chair during negotiations, Freeman's involvement is often glossed over in the scant number of available retellings.\nWhen I started my doctoral work in the sociology department at the University of Minnesota almost exactly forty years after the Morrill Hall Takeover (as it has come to be known), I'd never heard the story, nor did I understand the legacy of Freeman's leadership.\nWhich stories get told impact who is able to feel empowered by them. The erasure of Black women's stories weakens our understanding and connection to the legacy of Black women's accomplishments and dims the possibility of our collective strength.\nFifteen years before the Morrill Hall Takeover, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), working with Black families around the country, brought local lawsuits against counties across the South after being blocked from enrolling their children, mostly Black girls, into segregated white schools, culminating in the landmark Supreme Court case that legalized educational desegregation.\nThe stories of coordinated legal action are rarely heard, silencing the voices of all those other families who sacrificed themselves for the integration fight but whose names are absent from historical narratives on the issue.\nBrown v. Board of Education has been watered down to focus on one little girl, Linda Brown, wiping away what was actually a long-term, strategic plan between the NAACP, more than a dozen families, and the students themselves. This organized erasure of complex political protests organized in Black communities maintains perceptions of our ineptness in political organizing.\nIt is not a coincidence that girls and women (often mothers and teachers) led the fight for school desegregation. Black girls learn early in life that they will be expected to be poised and strong-willed in the face of danger and degradation.\nThe girls on the front lines of desegregation were physically and psychologically attacked, ignored, or otherwise pushed to their limits at school. In response, their voices were their weapons.\nThey utilized silence when deliberately provoked and spoke up in classes where teachers ignored their signals to participate voluntarily. They endured, sure, but they also made waves.\nSo much of the work of political organizing and protest has been concentrated among Black girls, in schools. But to highlight our skills of organization and execution of activism is to magnify our strengths, so the strategy and forethought of Black activism must be repackaged as insignificant or nonexistent. I didn't know my own connections to the desegregation movement until recently, which is perhaps to say I didn't know my strength.\nThree years after the Brown v. Board of Education decision, The Little Rock Nine, nine Black students—six girls and three boys—enrolled at the all-white Little Rock Central High School just a few blocks from where my mother lived with her family in Arkansas.\nJust a toddler at the time, my mother and her siblings were often under the care of fifteen-year-old, Carlotta (Walls) LaNier, the youngest of the Little Rock Nine attempting to integrate the local high school and the first Black woman to graduate from Little Rock Central High School.\nCarlotta was my family's regular babysitter; she was also on the front lines of American desegregation. She, along with her eight classmates, withstood the racial slurs and threats of physical violence in the name of education. She also paid a heavy price.\nAfter her graduation, the Walls family was forced to relocate to Colorado to find work and avoid the backlash caused by Carlotta's participation in the equal education fight. Ms. LaNier was a woman I'd never heard directly linked to my family until recently, when I made the decision to uncover her story as a part of ours.\nHistory, as a discipline and a social construct, does not view women, especially Black women, as historical actors. Despite our accomplishments, what we do is not often chronicled as \"real\" history. This is as true at Vassar as at any other HWSCU. In 1969 and again in 1990, Black students protested on campus and occupied buildings to demand fair treatment and increased support structures for Black students.\nIn 1969, thirty-four Black women undergrads took over the main building in the early morning hours, a result of detailed tactical planning, which allowed them to take over the switchboard with relative ease. They remained for three days until then President Alan Simpson responded to their demands.\nIn February 1990, a group of Black students again staged a sit-in at the main building, this time to protest the hiring of Daniel Patrick Moynihan—a white Republican sociologist infamous for his racist theories about the status of Black communities—as a distinguished lecturer at the college.\nMoynihan quit his post as a result of the protests. Recollection of the events is captured in the Vassar Encyclopedia, but you won't hear discussions of their organization on campus or about the improvements made as a result of their efforts.\nThere aren't photos capturing their occupation of Main Hall hung alongside those pictures of almost two hundred years of white students that serve as a visual history of the place. There are no anniversary celebrations or well-kept archives of what these students were fighting against or what they achieved. Their stories are functionally lost from the general history of the college.\nBlack students continue standing on the front lines of protests against police brutality and racism on college campuses across the country. They are being jailed, threatened, and vilified but also ignored in favor of the mainstream appeal of white student activists when the topic is appropriately \"non-racial.\"\nOn college campuses, Black students are challenging their \"othered\" status in ways I never thought possible. Conservatives often perpetuate the false narrative that colleges are places where hyper-liberal professors hijack students' minds with impractical, politically correct ideals. In reality, my students, mostly Black women, come to me not initially looking to protest.\nThey want to belong, to be the proverbial Vassar girls their white counterparts are offered the chance to become. And they are frustrated that the promises of higher education don't seem to apply to them.\nWe are not so different, my students and me. Protest is a last resort, a desperate act from groups of people without access to conventional support, but also with limited information about the activism of their forbearers.\nThese Black women want an education free from all the trappings of white supremacy that limit their potential. I didn't protest when I probably should've. I didn't recognize my connections to Black women activists and disruptors of the past, but they were there to be heard. And so, I try to pass down these stories, as bits of wisdom from the ancestors, that I wish I'd had.\nThis is an adapted excerpt from Black Women, Ivory Tower: Revealing the Lies of White Supremacy in American Education (Broadleaf Books, 2024).

        "content": "I felt like I was on top of the world. I was married to my loving husband and together, we had an amazing 17-month-old son whom we both adored. My dream of having kids close in age was about to become a reality, and I was so excited to learn that I was pregnant with my second child.\nAfter my first healthy, stress-free pregnancy, I couldn't wait for my son to have a little sister or brother. My husband, Eli, jumped up and down with joy when we saw the pregnancy test was positive.\nIn the back of my head, I knew that miscarriage was a possibility, but I didn't believe it could happen to me.\nAnd then it did.\nWhen I was eight weeks pregnant, I had my first ultrasound. I was told that my baby had a strong heartbeat. I brought up that I had some light spotting, but the doctor told me not to worry.\n\"Don't worry,\" she said. \"That's normal. It happens.\"\nI breathed a sigh of relief, but I wasn't entirely convinced. My gut feeling turned out to be right.\nI lightly bled for two weeks straight. When the blood suddenly became darker and redder, I reached out to my doctor's office to make an appointment.\nI thought my concerns would be met with care and urgency from my medical team. Instead, I had almost entirely the opposite reaction from those whose help I desired most.\nInsensitive receptionists, limited doctor appointments, and entire days where none of the eight to 10 doctors in practice were in the office, were just a few of the unexpected and stressful challenges I dealt with. It all made my horrifying experience infinitely worse.\nI finally got a follow-up appointment, the morning my husband was leaving for a five-day work trip. He had attended every single doctor's appointment until then.\nI'll never forget the look of pity on the doctor's face as she told me the bad news. Despite having a beating heart, my baby was missing a brain, and I was likely going to miscarry. I would have to wait and see what my body decided to do with the defective fetus.\nEli's flight was delayed, so I was able to catch him before he departed. Eli couldn't even comprehend the news himself, as he was chaperoning his high school boys' softball team for a tournament and had absolutely nobody to speak to about his own sense of loss and the guilt of being away from his wife, who was suffering greatly.\nAs an Orthodox Jew, I faced another level of complication: my cramps worsened over the Sabbath when I couldn't use technology, including making phone calls.\nThere are exceptions if one's life is in danger, but while I was in a whole lot of pain I wasn't sure if it qualified as a life-threatening situation. I sought advice from my next-door neighbor, who threatened to call the doctor herself if I didn't.\nI'm really glad I opened up to someone with a more rational way thinking. It allowed me to remove the stress of wondering if there was anything else I should have been doing.\nWhen I woke up on the final day of my husband being away, I experienced the worst cramps yet. So when I saw a giant, fetus-sized clump of blood in the toilet, I froze completely and had no idea what to do.\nMy instinct was to cover it up as soon as possible. My hand shot out and I immediately flushed it. Not having Eli or someone else more rational than I at that moment was horrifying.\nOf course, this was also one of the days when no doctors were available because the office was moving. I sobbed to multiple receptionists for help, pleading for an ultrasound to see if my whole saga was over.\nBy a stroke of luck, my ultrasound technician happened to pass by one of the kinder receptionists and overheard that I was asking to see someone. She advocated for me and ordered me to come in right away. I am forever grateful to have had one medical angel who was concerned, and showed me the empathy I needed in that moment.\nWhen my husband came home, he was finally able to absorb all that happened and let out his emotions. We gave ourselves some time and grace to mourn the loss.\nI was ultimately able to get pregnant again. I gave birth to a healthy baby girl 10 months later, and one more daughter 5 years later.\nLooking back on my experience, I was surprised that the internet was lacking in relatable content about miscarriages. Other than a few articles and clinical websites, it had nothing that comforted me when I was up way too late in the middle of the night, searching for something, anything, that could tell me how I would survive losing my fetus, as well as so many of my hopes and dreams with it.\nI was under the false impression that people don't talk about miscarriages, since traditionally we don't talk about pregnancies until after the first trimester. I tried to be strong all by myself, but it became very clear I had no idea how to comprehend all of my emotions and physical pains.\nI didn't want any woman who had gone through a miscarriage to feel alone like I did. So I drew what I went through, creating a short comic about my story called, \"Miscarried.\" Actress, Mayim Bialik, also a mother, helped me launch the comic publicly and the feedback was incredible.\nI started getting emails from people all over the world who related to my story and were glad to find that they weren't in this alone. I ended up making a video out of my comic to reach more people. It's launching in May.\nAs awful as my experience was, I'm thankful that I was able to share it. While the world has certainly made some progress in discussing miscarriages and other complications regarding childbirth, there's still a long way to go.\nI hope that by telling my story through my comics, I can help others feel less alone in their struggle and help women understand that sometimes miscarriages, though terrible, can be a natural part of life, and that nothing is wrong with women who miscarry.\nIt's 2024.

        "content": "There's nothing more distressing and heartbreaking than knowing a child is scared because of how their parents are interacting.\nOne morning, while the ink on our divorce papers was still drying, my co-parent and I were engaged in a tense exchange over a trip he intended to take.\nIt was supposed to be a routine pickup, yet I was horrified to see our young daughter cowering under the dining table. It was clear she wasn't playing a game. At the time, I thought: I could either ignore her and continue pushing my own need to be seen and acknowledged by my ex, or I could tend to her needs for safety and security.\nThat moment changed everything for me and my co-parenting relationship. I knew that even if I couldn't count on my co-parent to make changes, I had to make the effort to put our child's needs first.\nShe hadn't asked for any of this conflict—all she wanted was to love us both, and for us to work together so she could be free to play, grow, and learn.\nDuring those early days of my divorce, I felt like a failure because I hadn't kept our marriage together. Fear of being alone and fear that we were \"hurting our kid\" gripped my stomach.\nI was angry, hurt, and felt a sting of shame by the new sense that I was invisible as a single mom—as if I no longer belonged to what society considers a \"normal\" family.\nAs I sorted through these emotions, I realized that I needed a divorce, even if I didn't want it, and that I would have to pick up the pieces and rebuild—for myself and, more importantly, for my daughter. Whether or not my ex made changes was up to him, but I could do my part. As I discovered, even one parent making changes can have a positive impact.\nAround that time, I began to apply strategies from what I learned as a psychotherapist, about relationships and attachment theory. I was amazed to see how effective it was.\nWe were soon able to move from conflict to cooperation, and my daughter returned to being her happy self. This led me to working as a co-parenting coach, and it also led me to write a book to help co-parents create the secure foundation their kids need to thrive in two homes.\nThroughout my work, I found that many co-parents struggle with two main obstacles.\nLearning Healthy Communication Skills\nMany parents who end their marriage don't realize how important communication is, as as they navigate their new co-parenting relationship.\nGood communication is essential in knowing what is going on with their child when they aren't with them, planning for birthdays, coordinating school activities and vacations, and more. Communication is both verbal and non-verbal, consisting of tone, body language, and emotional tenor.\nEarly on, I became frustrated whenever my co-parent took days to respond to a text or walked away when I suggested how to care for our daughter. I felt out of control when he didn't give me the information I thought I needed. I was furious when I saw my daughter hobble out of school on my pickup day with a sprained ankle that happened at his place, but I hadn't heard about it.\nAs I sought ways to improve our communication, I turned to my professional knowledge of attachment theory. I noticed that my anxious-ambivalent attachment style—characterized by a need for validation and quick reassurances—influenced how I phrased requests or made suggestions.\nAt the same time, my co-parent's avoidant attachment style—characterized by a need for self-reliance and independence—led him to hear my requests as criticism and to avoid responding or getting defensive.\nI used these insights to change how I initiated a conversation or responded to my co-parent. I was able to rein in my need for validation from him while no longer personalizing his need to feel self-reliant, yet without compromising either of our needs.\nI focused on how we could reach a mutually beneficial goal: decreased conflict and increased cooperation so our kid would have calmer parents.\nEven six years after our divorce, I still get triggered over some of the same issues. But now, I take a walk, breathe, notice my feelings, and repeat my mantra: You're not going to get roses from the hardware store. Then, I send that text or start that conversation. It's not perfect, but we can move through the tricky moments quickly while maintaining a cooperative spirit.\nNavigating Different Parenting Styles\nOne main struggle I see between co-parents is over parenting styles. One parent follows a more permissive style with looser rules, while the other is stricter. This leads to the child being caught in the middle of a continuous battle.\nI worked with two co-parents who had different homework rules. Mom had a permissive stance. According to her rules, their son could do his homework whenever he wanted. But Dad was more strict. He became angry and punished his son for not doing his homework and falling behind in school.\nThe boy yelled and screamed and told his father he hated him. These co-parents were in full fight mode as well. Each said to the other, \"You're making it hard for me to parent!\"\nDifferent parenting styles can be an issue even in a nuclear family, but the lack of consistency it causes is accentuated in two homes.\nYou may not be able to change your co-parent's preferred parenting style, but you can discuss it with your co-parent and child. For example, the dad I just described might tell his son, \"I know your mom has different rules around homework, but here you have to finish it before dinner.\"\nIn therapy, these parents were able to go beyond their struggle over whose style was better so they could focus on their child's need to feel confident and supported.\nThey developed a structure they could both stand behind, and learned how to present a united front to their child, even if the rules were not identical in both homes. Their son stopped screaming at his father and instead went to his room to finish his homework before dinner. He voluntarily carried some of the structure his dad required into his mother's house because it made him feel more confident and gave him an important sense of control.\nI recommend that parents focus on maintaining consistent rules within their home, even if those rules differ from those in their child's other home.\nUltimately, all you can control is what you do in your home, including helping your child make sense of the differences and process their feelings about them. This will help your child feel safe with you and develop the flexibility, critical-thinking skills, and confidence to make life easier for them in the external world.\nDivorce itself does not hurts kids. How co-parents go through a divorce does. While divorce can feel like a massive loss, it can also present an opportunity. It is a chance to transform the remnants of a no-longer-functional romantic relationship into a successful co-parenting relationship.\nI have never regretted my marriage, yet I am grateful for my divorce. It brought me back to myself. It allowed me to find within myself the courage to speak up, the resources to heal, and the strength to extend my learning to others. Watching my daughter flourish in two homes has been an inspiration that has guided my efforts to help others.\nAurisha Smolarski is a certified co-parenting coach.

        "content": "When did you know you wanted to become a writer?\nOver the years, I have been asked this question countless times. I have listened to other authors give some version of similar answers: they just always knew they wanted to tell stories for a living.\nWell, not me. For me, writing wasn't something I wanted to do—it just became part of the fabric of who I am. I wrote stories. I read them. I wrote as if my life depended on it, but it wasn't until I discovered competitive boxing that my life shifted from being someone who wrote to being a professional author.\nYes, I was already in college for writing. I'd started as a journalism major and swiftly felt boxed in by the facts and rules. I wanted to stretch and play, so I shifted to creative writing. I minored in psychology. I let stories pour out of me. I have always been prolific, and it felt like a creative exorcism every time I would sit down to create.\nAt the time, I was a freshman in college, and I loved two things: boxing and writing. Well, and boys. Lots and lots of boys.\nI was good at boxing. I discovered martial arts when I was a teenager, though I'd grown up on a healthy diet of Friday night fights and boxing championships. I could rattle off a list of who was who in the fighting community, and I even became a sports journalist for a while.\nDuring that time, I was preparing to compete in my first boxing competition. I was nervous. I'd been an athlete for my whole life, but I could never quite tame my nerves. Not in gymnastics, or soccer, or dance, or track. During a sparring session one evening, I got popped in the eye, which was a pretty normal occurrence.\nIt wasn't until a sucking, pounding headache overtook the entire left side of my head that I knew something was wrong. I started cataloging other nagging issues I'd been ignoring: headaches, a bit of dizziness, a rapid pulse. I brushed it off until my coach told me I needed to go get looked at.\n\"I'm sure it's nothing,\" he said. \"Probably just overtraining.\"\nSo I went.\nThere are those moments in hospital rooms that people talk about: an unexpected diagnosis. A death sentence. Good news, even. For me, my life changed after one CT scan, when they called to deliver the results. I will never forget the urgency in the technician's voice.\n\"You have a three-and-a-half-inch mass on the left parietal lobe of your brain that's on the verge of hemorrhaging. You need to come in for an MRI immediately.\"\nAll I could think about was how big three inches was and the fact that I didn't know where the left parietal lobe of my brain even was. Plus, didn't a mass mean cancer?\nIn all my ignorance, I could only focus on one thing: boxing. I loved it. I was never not going to love it. So what did this mean for me then? Was this because of boxing? Had I done this to myself?\nOver the coming days, I was pumped full of drugs and dyes. I was poked and prodded while waiting in agony for results. They weren't good. It seemed, in all my competitive haste, that if I had gotten hit even one more time, I was dead.\nThe mass, a benign arachnoid cyst, was on the verge of rupturing. So, though it wasn't cancer, if I fell down and bonked my head on the way home, I was a goner anyway. Suddenly, cancer wasn't looking like the worst option—never boxing again seemed like a fate worse than death.\nI loved it as much as writing, if not more.\nDuring spring break, I got brain surgery. In a nutshell: when I was young, my arachnoid membranes split and filled with fluid. Maybe from being a gymnast, a boxer, or perhaps it was just one of those genetic things.\nThe cyst grew so large, it compressed my brain completely flat on the left side. My skull was as thin as an eggshell. They sliced me open, removed my brittle skull, and plopped it into a bowl. The cyst was situated around an aggravated vein and ruptured when they removed it—luckily, not in my head.\nMy brain puffed back to normal size. They replaced my skull, screwed in four rather large titanium plates and sixteen screws, closed me up with forty-two staples, and wheeled me to the ICU.\nThat was my first surgery.\nThey had not prepared me for what would come after: the holes in my forehead from the drills to keep my head steady during surgery, the hair that would fall out from the horrible scar, the reality that the cyst could grow back, the fact that I could have an aneurysm, and how my entire life now felt unsteady without a sport I loved or a family close by.\nA week later, I was back in school, and like so many tough times before, I began to write in order to make sense of what just happened.\nThe seeds of what would become my first novel took root. Looking back, that novel about a woman who abandons her children to pursue competitive boxing, only to get slowed down by a brain tumor, was like most first novels: too close to home.\nNo, I was not a mother, but as I wrote about this fictitious character, I realized it was a way to cope with the trauma of what I'd just been through.\nThat book landed itself a home when I was 22. It was not with a good publisher, but it seemed I had wedged my foot into the door of an industry I so desperately wanted to be a part of, but knew so little about.\nSo, it was only after my publishing experience went sour that I decided to learn. I began to study the industry once I graduated college and entered the real world. True to form, I was back in the boxing ring shortly after surgery but soon found I wanted to protect my brain more than ever, so sadly, I hung up my gloves.\nIt has now been 23 years since that surgery. Twenty-three years of having these titanium reminders in my head. Years and years of follow-up MRIs. Even now, my head tingles when there's a fire or a thunderstorm. And my hair never grew back across that white, jagged scar.\nBecause of that experience, I chose to take the risk to pursue life as an author. It hasn't been easy or linear, but it has been a lot less scary than getting brain surgery. I still remember them wheeling me back to the operating room. They told me to say goodbye to my family. I was terrified, but mostly I remember thinking: \"This will make for a hell of a story one day.\"\nNow, I tell stories for a living, and I help other people tell theirs.\nWould I have gotten here another way? Maybe. Or maybe not.\nBut now, when someone asks me how long I've wanted to be a writer, or when, I think of the therapy of writing, the process of writing, the channeling that happens through writing, and how it always helps me work through something—even when I don't know exactly what that something is.\nAnd I realize: we are all creators, but sometimes we forget. We forget to process, ruminate, put the phones down, and pick up a pen—or a paintbrush, or instrument. To walk for the sake of walking. To look up. To think about our lives and all that's happened without turning it into bite-size content for someone else to consume. To go after what we want, while we still want it. To take giant leaps into the unknown, to trust ourselves. To show up. To really show up.\nTo step all the way into the proverbial ring.\nRea Frey is the award-winning author of several domestic suspense, women's fiction, and nonfiction books.

        "content": "In 2013, I rented my first apartment, wrote my first resume, and eventually started my first (minimum-wage) job. I was 25 years old, inexperienced, and completely uneducated in how to be an independent woman.\nI had just left the Christian patriarchy movement, where I had been a stay-at-home daughter, living the Quiverfull lifestyle exhibited by the Duggar family.\nSince I hadn't been allowed to have a job outside the home, the only way I could make money was by teaching piano lessons, mostly to other homeschool families. And since I wasn't allowed to go to college, I studied piano pedagogy textbooks on my own to learn how to be a better teacher.\nI became resourceful despite my restrictions, and that's how I eventually escaped and started my life over, as I've written about in my new book, Rift: A Memoir of Breaking Away from Christian Patriarchy.\nI thought I had left that oppressive world behind, but now, more than a decade later, I see the #tradwife trend on social media, and it's bringing everything back—the glorification of traditional gender roles that were never as shiny as they appear with photo filters and curated vintage clothing.\nScrolling through TikTok, I see videos of women in long floral dresses. Their hair is perfectly curled, and they are cooking or gardening or creating crafts for their children. One thing is a constant: They are always at home.\nThese videos use the hashtag #tradwife, \"trad\" standing for \"traditional.\" And while this nickname is new, the content is not. In fact, it's deeply familiar to me as someone who was raised to become a traditional wife.\nBut the stay-at-home life is not as glamorous as it looks on TikTok and Instagram.\nBack in the 1990s and early 2000s, when I was being homeschooled and taught the beliefs of \"biblical patriarchy,\" we didn't have the term \"tradwife,\" and I likely wouldn't have been allowed to watch TikTok videos anyway.\n\"Traditional marriage,\" \"biblical womanhood,\" and \"Quiverfull\" were the terms we most often used to describe our lifestyle, which was founded on Christian fundamentalism.\nChristian or biblical patriarchy is an ideology and religious movement centered around the idea that God is masculine, the ultimate patriarch, which is why men were \"created\" to be leaders in the home, church, and government.\nWomen were called to be homemakers, submitting to their fathers until they married, when they would then submit to their husbands. Men and women had to conform to strictly distinct gender roles.\nAs a homeschooled kid, I was taught many typical subjects, or at least given books about them, but my focus was to grow up and become a stay-at-home wife and mother. I became proficient in cooking, sewing, and cleaning.\nAnything I was taught was framed as something I could use to benefit my future family. Learning math was so that I could help my future husband do his taxes. Learning to play piano was so I could accompany hymn singing.\nI was allowed to skip science one year because it wasn't \"necessary.\"\nWhen I turned 18, I didn't go to college or get a job. I was called a \"stay-at-home daughter\" because I was in training to be a wife. My father told me that I didn't need an education or a career because it wouldn't help me in my calling and would tempt me away from God's righteous path.\nHomemaking was glorified as the ideal calling for women. Instead of video-sharing apps, we had Vision Forum catalogs where gender-specific toys were sold and glossy photographs of girls in frilly dresses and boys in Colonial hunting garb were shown to create an aesthetic of \"the good old days\" when men and women had separate gender roles. Books like So Much More and The Excellent Wife and magazines like Above Rubies and Patriarch extolled this lifestyle as one of beauty and divine purpose.\nSo watching #tradwife content is hauntingly familiar to me. These are not new ideas. It is the same old patriarchy wearing a different dress.\nJust like some of these creators say in their videos, I was also told this lifestyle was a choice, that I wasn't being forced into it. At the same time, I was restricted from outside information, prohibited from going to college, and not allowed to have a job outside the home.\nTheoretically, I could have moved out and chosen my own path, but as someone with limited life skills and insufficient finances, I had no idea how to actually do that when I turned 18.\nNot to mention that going against these gender restrictions would have been \"sinful\" and \"ungodly,\" marking me as an outsider to my family and church. So, even though I was \"choosing\" to be a stay-at-home daughter, I didn't really have any other option.\nToday, when I hear content creators sharing about how they choose to stay home and then say they submit to their husbands in the same video, I understand the dynamics at play behind the scenes.\nThe very concept of submission is that you are giving up your decision-making to someone else. If you \"choose\" to be a stay-at-home wife and give up all financial independence, you are placing yourself in a position where you won't have any choice in the future.\nThese videos are known for their ultra-feminine clothing and cozy cooking tutorials, but underlying many of them is a more disturbing ideology: That a woman is fulfilling her God-given purpose if she is a traditional wife who stays home and submits to her husband.\nAdding the promise of divine blessing to a lifestyle choice makes it more of a command than an act of true consent.\nOne #tradwife content creator named Estee recently shared a video of advice for high school girls who want to become traditional wives one day. \"Stay home as long as you possibly can,\" she says.\nShe goes even further by saying: \"If you want to be a traditional wife in the future, you don't need to go to college.\" In another video, Estee says women don't need prenups if they marry the right man because they can trust him not to betray the relationship. Instead, prayer is the best safeguard against divorce.\nAnother content creator named Jasmine Dinis says in one video that she is teaching her young daughter \"it's perfectly acceptable to depend on a man...that serving her husband and bearing children will be her greatest joy.\" Another video of hers proclaims, \"I used to be really into politics but now I just relax while my husband tells me what to think.\"\nThese words are so familiar that they trigger long-ago memories of being indoctrinated to believe that my only purpose was to be a wife and mother who didn't \"need\" a job or independent thoughts.\nAs I was in my twenties, unmarried and waiting for my father to help me find the perfect husband, I became deeply depressed and felt purposeless.\nServing men didn't bring me true happiness or fulfillment. I wanted to be my own person, but that would have gone directly against the mission to make me a submissive wife.\nAnd I had witnessed many women getting married and having extremely difficult lives as homemakers. They struggled with poverty, impossible expectations, domestic abuse, lack of bodily autonomy, burnout, and shame.\nAbove all, their lack of choice and true agency kept them trapped in unhealthy marriages.\nAnd while the #tradwife trend is fascinating to watch and even aesthetically pleasing for viewers who crave a slower lifestyle, it points to a deeper misogyny in our culture and a dangerous shift toward authoritarianism in American politics, one where women are encouraged to stay home, men are made to be the sole providers, and girls grow up believing they will be better off not having any real decision-making power in their lives.\nGirls like me.\nBut I know change is possible. I found a way to escape, and I will never willingly give up my agency for anyone.\nI'm sharing my story to prevent this kind of suffering in others because while being a stay-at-home [fill in the blank] is a valid choice for many, giving up your agency to submit to a spouse can lead to devastating consequences.\nWhen I tell girls they can be whoever they want, I'm really saying those words to myself, because after decades of being made to feel like I could only be a helpmate, I still need reminding that I have a voice.\nCait West is a writer and editor based in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

        "content": "President Joe Biden has signed into law a bill that gives TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, just nine months to sell the app or face a complete ban in the U.S.\nSecurity issues are at the heart of the potential ban, including concerns that TikTok shares user data with the Chinese government, a practice it has denied.\nAs the uncertainty over TikTok's future continues, the app's 150 million U.S. users are understandably concerned about the possibility of a ban. Content creators who have built huge audiences are wondering if they will lose the following they have worked hard to create.\nSo what can you do to protect your content in the event of a TikTok ban?\nJess Hunichen, co-founder of a global influencer talent management agency called the Shine Talent Group, has some advice for users.\nFor some people, the only place they keep their video content is on their TikTok account. Hunichen told Newsweek it is important to keep all of your content backed up and saved so nothing is lost if a ban occurs.\nThankfully, it is easy to download your videos from TikTok on both iPhone and Android:\n- Open TikTok and find the video you want to download\n- Tap the three dots on the right\n- Select \"Save video\" and your video will instantly download to your device\n\"Consider pinning a post on your TikTok account encouraging your audience to follow you on other platforms to support you,\" Hunichen said. She said this can help keep followers engaged with your content wherever it is posted.\nPinning a post on TikTok takes a few moments. After creating a video or image slideshow that directs your followers to your other platforms, follow these instructions:\n- Find the video you want to pin\n- Tap the three dots in the bottom right corner\n- Select the \"Pin\" option from the menu\n- The video will now be pinned at the top of your profile\nDuring this time of uncertainty about TikTok's future, Hunichen encourages content creators to share their content on other platforms.\n\"We are recommending that our talent spend time to build their presences on other platforms that aren't as strong as their TikTok presence,\" Hunichen said. \"For example, they should syndicate TikTok videos to Instagram Reels. They should push their audience over to Instagram to try and minimize the impact if a ban does happen.\"\n\"It's unclear whether another platform will pop up and try to replicate or take the place of TikTok. Only time will tell,\" Hunichen said. \"Money, marketing and ad dollars are still going to be spent on social media platforms. It's how brands can reach their audience through trusted and vetted sources. We'll likely see big shifts and big dollars moving over to Instagram and YouTube.\"\nThe main focus should be to ensure that even without TikTok it is still possible to reach your audience, she said. \"They should have a way to reach their audience directly and communicate the types of content that can be viewed on their different owned platforms to their followers.\"\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n",

        "content": "A senior dog in an alarming state of health was found abandoned in a park alongside a heartbreaking note.\nKim Astringer, the director of New Jersey-based Tiny Paws Rescue, said they were first tipped off to the plight of 15-year-old Sheba after receiving a phone call asking for help. \"A good Samaritan found her tied to a park bench, alone, with the note from her owner,\" Astringer told Newsweek. The note read: \"Please take me and love me.\"\nLittle is known about Sheba's life before the shelter.\n\"She was missing some fur, had some matted fur, and had severe dental disease,\" Astringer said.\"Through a vet exam and senior bloodwork, we found that Sheba has an underactive thyroid. She was immediately started on medication for that.\"\nThey also quickly discovered that Sheba was deaf and had \"limited vision\" at best. Despite this, Astringer noted she still \"seems to navigate pretty well\" around the shelter.\nThe note that was left with Sheba also gave Astringer some pause for thought.\n\"We would like to believe that she was loved by her previous family and that they maybe did not have the means to get her the proper vet care she needed,\" she said. \"They also could have been afraid she would be euthanized if brought to the local shelter, which is currently overpopulated.\"\nSadly, she said situations like the one that played out here are not as uncommon as some might think. \"Times are tough these days for families,\" Astringer said. \"Homelessness is on the rise and sadly, they may have felt that this their only option to find her a better home, a better life.\"\nBefore Sheba can find that better life, she's having to adjust to life away from everything she once called home. It's an adjustment many dogs struggle with.\nDogs entering shelters were found to have three times the level of the stress hormone cortisol in their system over the first three days following admission, compared with canines from an ordinary household, according to a 2006 study in the journal Physiology and Behavior.\nGiven her age and health status, it was perhaps unsurprising that Sheba endured some struggles when she first arrived at Tiny Paws Rescue.\n\"When she first came to us it was hard on her; she was obviously terrified and confused,\" Astringer said. \"She would just shake with her head down in the corner of the room.\"\nThankfully, things have improved significantly since then and once Sheba was taken in by a foster carer. \"She's doing much better in the week we've had her, coming out of her shell a little more every day,\" Astringer said. \"She enjoys a restful sleep in her comfy bed and also loves going on leashed walks. She's a complete joy to be around!\"\nDescribing Sheba as a \"well socialized, very friendly\" dog who is comfortable with people of all ages and canines alike, Astringer said that while she's only been with them a short amount of time, they already have some idea of what kind of home would suit the senior pup best.\n\"We are still getting to know her but Sheba would definitely enjoy a quiet home with maybe one other low key or laid back dog her size,\" Astringer said.\nAstringer shared a video to TikTok last week detailing Sheba's plight and the help they are giving her in the hope that it might shine a light on the efforts of rescue organizations like hers. \"These smaller organizations, like ours, are in desperate need of monetary support so we can continue to help the pets in our local communities,\" she said.\nShe also wanted to send a message to whoever left Sheba by that bench. \"We would like them to know that she's safe and loved,\" Astringer said. \"We are taking care of her medical issues and promise to find her the very best home to live out her golden years.\"\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n",

However, when the only person you can hold accountable is yourself, it can be hard to stay in check.\nTo come up with a solution to keep herself in check and ensuring she was making time for herself, 28-year-old Trina Merz, a holistic healing practitioner from Hawaii, and her friend Marouane decided to take matters into their own hands and begin holding each other accountable.\nTo spread the word of her wellness tip, Merz shared a video to TikTok by @breatheintransformation, where it amassed more than 2.5 million views.\nIn the video, Merz said: \"My friend and I came up with this thing we call 'saving the day'. If we spent the whole day working, we do one thing that reclaims the day as our own.\"\nGiving examples as to what she counts as a 'save the day' activity, she said, \"we would reach out to each other and say like, 'Hey, how did you save the day?' I made it out for a surf, or I called my mom and went for a walk, or I made a really delicious meal.\n\"There's honestly so many ways you can save the day, and it doesn't have to be a huge time commitment.

She said that, \"We'd both been doing this for a long time, but calling it 'saving the day' came when my good friend Marouane and I were saving the day together. I was still transitioning out of corporate life and into facilitating breathwork full-time and he was navigating his software engineering career.\n\"When I was working as a designer, my days needed saving often. I love to walk, and I was living in NYC at the time, so lots of walks by the Hudson [River] were saves. Yogamaya saved a ton of my days, too. On days I didn't have much time, having a cup of tea and sitting in my reading nook was my save.\"\nMerz's daily habit has inspired many to be more conscious about taking time for themselves, as she said that \"It's been so inspiring seeing all the comments flood in; I've even had managers say they're implementing this as a check-in in morning meetings.\"\nFor those wondering how this approach and outlook can help their mental health, Merz said: \"Making an intention to find the good, and find the joy in your life is like strengthening a muscle. You start with a 5-pound weight and then you're ready for a 10-pound and you just keep getting stronger. Our minds work like that, too.\n\"Our brains have a negativity bias that leaves us remembering things we didn't enjoy with 10 times the impression. We have to make a conscious effort to correct that, and the more we do, the stronger the muscle of seeing the good in our lives gets.\"\nIs there a health issue that's worrying you?

        "content": "This realtor often shares social-media videos to document the process of buying and selling a home, but one of her recent clips explaining the emotional reason for paint on the floor has left internet users in tears.\nCaroline Holman posted on TikTok (@realtoroftheyear) to share that she was doing a final run through of the home in Wilmington, North Carolina, when she noticed the green paw prints dotted around the guest bedroom. In the clip, she says that the sellers were painting when their dog walked into the paint and traipsed it around the room, but after the pup sadly passed away, they didn't have the heart to get rid of the paw prints.\nAfter learning the back story to stains on the floor, Holman, 30, told Newsweek that she \"just melted\" and as a dog owner herself, she totally understood why the sellers kept them.\n\"There were probably seven paw prints in total, and they wrapped around the door, too. I don't know what kind of dog it was, but it must have been a large breed as they were very spaced out,\" Holman, from Nest Realty and The Costin Group, said.\nHowever, the flooring was \"beyond repair\"; and it was set to be ripped apart shortly after Holman posted the video that would \"make you cry on a Monday morning.\" But with the help of social media, she and the buyer came up with an adorable plan to preserve the paw prints.\nShe said: \"My buyer thought it was absolutely adorable, and as we're both huge dog people, we both said we would have done the same thing and left them forever. I knew the story of the pawprints was not going to be one we could forget. After I shared it on social media, I started getting comments with the idea to save them for the sellers, which was brilliant.\n\"My buyer had the flooring guys save as much as they could, and we're going to put it together in some form and gift it to the sellers. I loved the idea to preserve the flooring, and the timing worked out so well because the flooring guys came the same day I posted the video,\" Holman added.\nSince the TikTok clip about the paw prints that can \"never be wiped up\" was shared on April 23, it has been viewed over 805,300 times and gained more than 98,900 likes already. If it hadn't been for the overwhelming reaction to her video, Holman says that she may not have thought about saving the flooring for the seller.\nNow, it has become such a wonderfully elaborate plan, even the listing agent is in on it too, and everyone is so excited to surprise the seller with this unexpected gesture. They may be leaving this house, but they will always get to keep a piece of it with them.\nHolman is so grateful to the 240-plus people who have already commented on her video with ideas to preserve the paw prints. One comment reads: \"Have them send the sellers the boards with the paint.\"\nAnother person wrote: \"But why not have them save the tiles and make a frame for the old homeowners.\"\nOthers posted that they couldn't possibly leave the home if it carried so much sentiment. One TikTok user responded: \"The way I would never sell my house. I would cancel the contract and move back.\"\n\"I'd never change the flooring! I'd make it KNOWN to not change the flooring to all my kids,\" another person added.\nDo you have any adorable videos or pictures of your pet you want to share? We want to see the best ones!

However, that hasn't always been the case and it's taken time to develop a positive state of mind that allows her to love herself wholeheartedly.\nCuccurullo knows that not everyone has this positive mindset, so she posted a video to TikTok (@danacucc) last month urging people not to feel so insecure. In the clip, she explains that insecurities come from \"the fear of being judged,\" but they're all in our heads and other people don't see them.\nOvercoming insecurities is all about mindset, as Cuccurullo tells Newsweek that people have to realize that they're internal rather than external before they can \"stop overthinking what others see.\" We might feel plagued by them, but on the outside, people wouldn't even notice.\n\"Insecurities are a result of society, media, and consumption. What you see affects the way you view yourself. But no one knows what your insecurities are, so you're most likely not even being judged for it,\" Cuccurullo said. \"No one is perfect, but the beauty in all of us comes from how unique we are because we're all one of a kind. We are perfectly imperfect, and that's something to celebrate not dwell over.\"\nSince the TikTok video was shared, it has gone viral and generated more than 7.2 million views and over 525,300 likes so far. In order to prove her point, Cuccurullo asks viewers to guess her \"biggest insecurity\" by looking at her, and then proceeds to explain that sometimes she feels insecure about her arms, which most people probably wouldn't have even guessed.\nWhile everyone's insecurities are personal, Cuccurullo suggests that they often stem from the shifting beauty standards that make people want to change themselves to follow current trends. But once people realize that their imperfections are what make them who they are, they will be much happier about the reflection staring back at them in the mirror.\nIt has taken a lot of personal growth and confidence for Cuccurullo to reach the point she's at now, and she hopes that using her social media platform will help others accomplish a similar mindset.\n\"Most of the comments are positive and people felt a sense of reassurance that they aren't alone, and my advice sparked something in them. However, a lot of comments are negative and didn't quite understand the point of the video,\" she told Newsweek. \"There are people who see positivity, and there are ones who know it's there but choose to avoid it. The more insecure you are, the more envy and jealousy you develop.\"\nThe viral TikTok video has gained over 6,800 comments already, as some people posted about their own insecurities, while others praised Cuccurullo's words of wisdom.\nOne user wrote: \"Everything that came to my head is what I'm insecure about for myself.\"\nAnother TikTok user commented: \"Everyone needs to hear this!\"\nWhile a third responded: \"Wow these comments are so disappointing. You're beautiful girl!\"\nIs there an issue that's worrying you? Let us know via health@newsweek.com.

        "content": "China has been buying up commodities at a rapid clip, prompting analysts to wonder out loud whether Beijing is preparing to choose the economic \"nuclear option.\"\n\"China is preparing for something major. That seems increasingly obvious judging from the stockpiling of important resources. Could it be that they are preparing a major one-off devaluation of the CNY?\" Andreas Steno Larsen, CEO of Steno Research, wrote last week.\nCurrency devaluation is widely described as a \"nuclear option\" by economists due to the serious global repercussions it could trigger.\nBy intentionally devaluing the yuan, for instance, China could boost exports by making its goods cheaper and more competitive—but not without serious repercussions such as riling trade partners and worsening the country's trade war with the United States.\nTell me a devaluation is coming without telling me that a devaluation is coming.. A MAJOR DEVALUATION OF THE CNY COULD BE IMMINENTMore -> https://t.co/sILjD22sw0 pic.twitter.com/R3F9UuKxuN\nAccumulating resources like gold and oil beforehand could provide some financial security and bargaining power, helping to stabilize the economy against potential negative effects of a devaluation, such as increased import costs and inflation.\nChina's central bank continued its gold-buying tear in March, boosting its reserves of the metal for the 17th straight month, in spite of the metal's record-high price and a weak yuan.\nEconomists have attributed this to China's efforts to diversify assets amid geopolitical tensions with the U.S., having witnessed the economic hit Russia took for its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\"Official gold purchases reflect a desire to diversify foreign exchange reserves away from the dollar and other Western currencies, Eswar Prasad, Cornell University professor and a former International Monetary Fund official in charge of China, told Newsweek.\nAs for the private sector's growing holdings of gold bullion and jewelry, these \"are likely to be driven by domestic policy risk, as a way of moving capital out of the Chinese financial system,\" he said.\nChina's steady accumulation of raw materials also extends to crude oil.\nAlready the largest importer of the resource, the country purchased a record 11.3 million barrels per day last year, according to customs authorities, a 10 percent increase over 2022. Notably, however, this rise accompanied the spike in demand for fuel following the end of China's strict pandemic-era restrictions.\nChina has leveraged its \"no limits\" partnership with Russia, which last year supplanted Saudi Arabia as China's largest petroleum exporter, to secure a reliable, discounted flow of energy while helping to prop up Moscow's isolated war economy.\nDevaluation may be tempting for China, the world's largest exporter, as it seeks to expand its industrial footprint in international markets for its goods amid deflation and insufficient consumer demand domestically.\nBut this move would be sure to drive up tensions with Washington and other major trade partners.\nChinese industries are already being accused of flooding markets with low-cost exports like steel and chemicals, prompting investigations. The U.S. and European Union are already mulling tariffs on China's electric vehicles.\n\"I don't believe China is preparing to devalue its currency against the dollar,\" Craig Shapiro, macro adviser to LaDucTrading, told Newsweek. \"But I do believe that China continues to purchase commodity resources, which it can purchase in RMB (renminbi/yuan) from sanctioned producers like Russia and Iran.\"\nShapiro said China's commodities-buying spree is primarily because \"China's ability to buy commodities in RMB and settle excess trade balances in gold with countries like Russia, and those in OPEC, suggests that the gold buys more commodities in China than it does in the West.\"\nBut there could be another, more ominous explanation for China's resource stockpiling. Beijing could be bracing itself for the international fallout that would result from an invasion of Taiwan.\n\"Xi seems to have studied the sanctions playbook the West used against Russia over Ukraine and subsequently initiated long-lead protective measures to batten down the hatches of China's economy to resist similar pressure,\" Michael Studeman, former head of the Office of Naval Intelligence, wrote in a recent op-ed on War on the Rocks.\nChina is also moving to mitigate its exposure to embargoes of food as well as energy, building up its strategic reserves of petroleum and constructing \"coal-fired plants with renewed fervor,\" Studeman said.\n\"Xi likely knows attempting to assimilate Taiwan would lead to much fiercer global resistance and harsher whole-of-society repercussions that would likely last years. And he intends to ready China to endure them,\" Studeman said, comparing the global reaction to China's crackdown in Hong Kong with what could occur should Beijing attack Taiwan.\nChina claims democratic Taiwan as its territory, though Beijing's ruling Chinese Communist Party has never governed there. U.S. officials believe Xi has instructed Chinese forces to be prepared to invade the island by 2027, though opinion in Washington is divided on how real the threat is.\nUpdate 4/30/24, 1:45 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with a comment from Eswar Prasad.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n",

According to Merchan, the posts violated a gag order barring any attacks on jurors and witnesses.\nIn his written order, Merchan said he would not tolerate further violations from the former president, adding that \"if necessary and appropriate,\" he would impose \"an incarceratory punishment\" on Trump.\nNewsweek reached out to a representative for Trump via email on Tuesday for comment.\nIn 34 felony counts, Trump is accused of falsifying business records in connection with a $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 election, allegedly made to keep her from talking about an affair she says they had.\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and has denied all charges as well as the affair.\nMerchan had placed a gag order on Trump that prohibits him from making public statements about \"known or reasonably foreseeable witnesses concerning their potential participation\" or \"public statements about any prospective juror or any juror.\"\nOn Tuesday, Merchan ruled Trump in contempt for nine violations of the gag order related to the Truth Social and campaign website posts and imposed a fine of $1,000 for each violation.

If they did not, they would be suspended pending further investigation.\nIn a show of their determination to not back down, student protesters defaced the notices with comments written in red marker, including \"Columbia will burn,\" \"Suspension for Gaza is the highest honor!\" and \"I ain't reading all that Free Palestine,\" according to posts on social media.\nAt Columbia, the 2pm notice to clear the encampment has passed. Students have been taping or pinning defaced notices for alternative resolution to themselves as they remain. pic.twitter.com/3hDiFPsJ4m\nHundreds of protesters remained after the 2 p.m. deadline passed on Monday, and Columbia later said it had started suspending students.\nThen in the early hours of Tuesday morning, at least a dozen protesters occupied Hamilton Hall, one of several buildings that was occupied during a civil rights and anti-Vietnam War protest on the campus in 1968.\n\"An autonomous group reclaimed Hind's Hall, previously known as \"Hamilton Hall,\" in honor of Hind Rajab, a Gazan martyr murdered at the hands of the genocidal Israeli state at the age of six years old,\" Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), the group behind the encampment, said in a statement posted on X, formerly Twitter, early Tuesday.\nThe statement added: \"This university repeatedly endangers its students by instituting a police state with military-style checkpoints, repressing and isolating students on campus, calling armed riot cops for the largest mass arrests on campus since 1968, and weaponizing food insecurity and houselessness as leverage in negotiations.\n\"Columbia has forced protesters to escalate by contributing to a genocide while refusing to follow baseline standards of conduct that make negotiation possible.\"\nThe protesters said they intend to remain in the building \"until Columbia concedes to CUAD's three demands: divestment, financial transparency and amnesty.\"\nCUAD has been contacted for comment via email.\nColumbia University President Minouche Shafik said on Monday that while the university \"will not divest from Israel,\" it had offered to develop an \"expedited timeline for review of new proposals from the students by the Advisory Committee for Socially Responsible Investing.\"\nColumbia has urged staff and students to stay away from the campus.\n\"The safety of every single member of this community is paramount,\" university spokesperson Ben Chang told Newsweek in an email. \"The first step we have taken is to alert our campus community—in light of the protest activity, we have asked members of the University community who can avoid coming to the Morningside campus to do so; essential personnel should report to work according to university policy.\"\nChang added that access has been limited to students residing in residential buildings on campus and essential employees.\nThe student protesters in their statement warned the university against calling in law enforcement to clear them out.\n\"To Columbia's administrators and trustees: do not incite another Kent or Jackson State by bringing soldiers and police officers with weapons onto our campus,\" they said, referring to incidents when police and National Guardsmen killed student protesters at two universities in 1970. \"Students' blood will be on your hands.\"\nStudent protests have roiled college campuses across the country in recent weeks, with encampments popping up at universities nationwide since more than 100 demonstrators were arrested at Columbia on April 18 after university officials called in police to clear a \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment\" that students set up.\nThe students are calling for their universities to cut financial ties with Israel and divest from companies they say are enabling the war in Gaza. The war began after Hamas' attack on southern Israel on October 7, when militants killed about 1,200 people and took roughly 250 hostages. Israel has subsequently killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, The Associated Press reported, citing the local health ministry.\nIsrael and many of its supporters have labeled the protests antisemitic, and some Jewish students have said they make them afraid to set foot on campus.\nHowever, others have noted that many Jewish students are involved in the protests and there is nothing inherently antisemitic about criticizing Israel's policies. Pro-Palestinian student protesters say their movement is anti-Zionist, but not antisemitic. Rashid Khalidi, a Palestinian-American historian and professor of Arab Studies at Columbia, told Newsweek that allegations of antisemitism are \"a malign tactic used to smear the students.\"\nUniversities are grappling with how to clear out the encampments ahead of upcoming graduation ceremonies. Some are continuing to negotiate, but others have turned to force and ultimatums that have resulted in suspensions and clashes with police.\nThe number of arrests at campuses since the initial arrests at Columbia is now approaching 1,000. Dozens of protesters were arrested at the University of Texas on Monday, while officers in riot gear reportedly deployed tear gas to break up a protest at Virginia Commonwealth University.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n",

In contrast, the average teacher salary in California is $95,160, the highest in the country.\nFlorida had ranked 48th when it came to average teacher salary last year, but dropped to 50th place in this year's report after salaries rose by only about 3 percent.\nThe average teacher salary in the state was far below the national average, which increased to $69,544. It was also below Florida's minimum living wage of $58,970—defined as the income needed for a family of one adult and one child to have a modest but adequate standard of living in the most affordable metro area—according to the NEA.\nFlorida's average starting teacher salary was $47,178, giving it a rank of 16th in the country. The average higher education faculty salary in Florida is $102,927, which is 15th in the country.\nThe NEA said its findings show that chronic low pay plagues the teaching profession in general, with 77 percent of school districts paying teachers a starting salary below $50,000 and more than a third of full time K-12 education support professionals earning less than $25,000 a year.\nThe findings come as Florida is dealing with a worsening teacher shortage. There were more than 7,500 advertised vacancies for teachers and educational support staff, the Florida Education Association (FEA) reported in January.\n\"Once again, despite a thriving economy, Florida is failing to prioritize the needs of students by not fairly compensating teachers and staff,\" FEA president Andrew Spar said in response to the NEA report.\n\"Time and time again, anti-education politicians say they support teachers—but the proof is undeniable,\" Spar said. \"In the past five and a half years since Governor DeSantis took office, Florida's public-school teachers have experienced a stagnant and declining average salary.\"\nA DeSantis spokesperson has been contacted for comment via email.\nNewsweek reported last year how growing numbers of teachers in Florida were quitting the profession, mostly citing low pay. Spar said vacancies were rising because as well as teachers leaving the profession before reaching retirement age, not enough people in Florida are choosing to become teachers.\nThe FEA said it has called on lawmakers in the state to increase funding by $2.5 billion a year for the next seven years to address inadequate pay, hire more mental health specialists and address the academic needs of students.\n\"It is unacceptable that Florida ranks so close to last in the nation for teacher pay and that the teacher shortage crisis is still not being addressed,\" Spar added.\n\"Every student in Florida deserves a world class education. Every educator deserves the ability to create a better life for themselves and their loved ones,\" he said. \"We need Florida's lawmakers to step up and take bold action and fully fund public education to ensure our students can learn and grow. Florida's students and educators need better.\"\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n",

It's not right.\n\"Now, if President Trump is given a fair jury, a fair trial like anybody else in this country would be—because his name is Trump, he doesn't—that's where my concern is, not the facts. The facts are on our side.\"\nNewsweek reached out to Habba via email for further comment.\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in relation to \"hush money\" he arranged for his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, to pay adult film star Stormy Daniels to keep an alleged affair she had with Trump a secret in the run-up to the 2016 election.\nThe money was listed in Trump's company records as \"legal fees,\" which prosecutors suggest was part of an unlawful attempt to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential race. Trump admits reimbursing the $130,000 to Cohen but denies having an affair with Daniels.\nIn 2023, Trump failed to get the trial moved out of Manhattan over concerns about potential jury impartiality.\n\"Very unfair venue, with some areas that voted 1% Republican,\" Trump posted on Truth Social last April ahead of his historic first court appearance. \"This case should be moved to nearby Staten Island—would be a very fair and secure location for the trial.\"\nChuck Rosenberg, a former U.S. attorney and senior FBI official, previously rejected Trump's argument and said there is no precedent for moving the location of trials based on perceived jury bias.\n\"We tried a 9/11 conspirator in federal court in the Eastern District of Virginia—Alexandria, about three miles from the Pentagon—and we were able to assemble a fair jury,\" Rosenberg told MSNBC.\n\"So, you're not looking for a jury that's never heard of Donald Trump or Stormy Daniels or hush money payments. You're not looking for a jury or jurors that have no opinions.\n\"You're looking for jurors who can be fair, who can sit in the courtroom, listen to the evidence, and follow the instructions of the judge,\" he added. \"That's all you're looking for.\"\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n",

More than 34,000 Palestinians have died in Gaza since the war began, The Associated Press reported, citing local health officials.\nSimilar protests have broken out at other colleges such as Yale University, Northwestern University, Princeton University, George Washington University and the University of California, Los Angeles.\nNewsweek also previously published a list showing where pro-Israel counterprotests have broken out at college campuses.\nLast week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu published a video on X criticizing the ongoing protests in the U.S. \"Antisemitism on campuses in the United States is reminiscent of what happened in German universities in the 1930s,\" he wrote in the post. \"The world cannot stand idly by.\"\nWhile speaking to reporters last week, U.S. President Joe Biden said, \"I condemn the antisemitic protests… That's why I've set up a program to deal with that. I also condemn those who don't understand what's going on with the Palestinians.\"\nAdditionally, White House Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates told reporters last week that the Biden administration was \"of course, aware of the protests.\" He said that \"we know that this is a painful moment for many communities.

The accompanying drone footage showed the projectile striking the desired mark on the ground. It was said to be the first such demonstration during the combined air exercises this year coordinated out of Kunsan Air Base in the east from April 12 to 26.\nAmong the most commonly used smart bombs, first seen in the Gulf War, the GBU-12 and its updated variants can also be fired from aircraft, including the B-52 Stratofortress, A-10 Thunderbolt II or \"Warthog,\" F-15E Strike Eagle, F/A-18 Hornet, B-1B Lancer, F-16C/D Fighting Falcon and F-35 Lightning II, according to the specialist Air & Space Forces Magazine.\nThe MQ-9 \"was configured to participate in numerous training scenarios to rehearse its precision strike, close air support, and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities,\" the Air Force said.\nAround 28,500 U.S. troops are forward-deployed to South Korea as part of a decades-long effort to prevent aggression from the North. As the United States heads toward a major presidential election this fall, North Korea leader Kim Jong Un may feel emboldened to provoke a limited conflict in a bid to extract concessions, observers say.\nThe U.S. Seventh Air Force, headquartered at Osan Air Base in South Korea, said this year's expanded Korea Flying Training—involving nearly 20 different types of military aircraft—would include integrating fifth-generation capabilities from both countries. This would also involve \"training mission commanders and aircrew to fly, flight and win in scenarios with robust surface-to-air and air-to-air threats.\"\nLast month, amid worsening inter-Korean relations, Kim Yo Jong, Kim Jong Un's powerful sister, blamed the U.S. and South Korea for the deteriorating situation on the peninsula. In a statement carried by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency, the senior Workers' Party official accused the allies of destabilizing \"muscle-flexing.\"\n\"We will continue to build up our overwhelming and most powerful military muscle to defend our sovereignty and security and regional peace,\" Kim Yo Yong said.\nThe Pacific Air Forces did not immediately respond to a written request for comment before publication.\nIn January, South Korea announced that production had begun on a domestically developed surveillance drone for its air force, a long-endurance unmanned system modeled on the capabilities of the MQ-9, which is manufactured by a unit of the U.S. defense contractor General Atomics. The project, nearly two decades in the making, will cost over $300 billion.\nThe following month, the U.S. approved India's order of 31 MQ-9B SkyGuardian drones for its navy, army and air force—part of a package worth nearly $4 billion\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, at a House Armed Services Committee budget hearing on Tuesday, said Russia had turned to North Korea for artillery shells and missiles for use in the ongoing war in Ukraine.\n\"North Korea … is becoming more confident because of its affiliation with [Vladimir] Putin, so this is very concerning, something that we're going to have to watch,\" Austin said.\nRussia vetoed a U.N. resolution in late March that would have extended an expert panel's mandate to monitor the sanctions regime against North Korea for the country's nuclear and ballistic missile tests.\nThe North Korean Embassy in Beijing and the Russian Foreign Ministry did not return multiple requests for comment.\nBoth Pyongyang and Moscow have denied trading arms.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n",

        "content": "Americans are losing a whopping $450 million while trying to find a job online.\nFake job scams accounted for roughly 105,000 scams in 2023, according to the Federal Trade Commission, and they are now seen as one of the fastest growing types of scams as Americans face an uncertain job market.\nAll in all, fake job scams increased by more than five times over the past five years. The FBI recorded 15,000 victims of this type of scam, who say they lost more than $52 million. Many victims likely never report scams either, too embarrassed to come forward.\nArtificial intelligence has made fake job postings even easier for fraudsters to create, and those who recently graduated or have been laid off are vulnerable to falling victim.\n\"While there have been many positive effects to the rise of AI, one of the negatives is the power to more easily scam potential employees on a larger scale than ever before,\" Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor at the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek.\n\"The methods and delivery of these messages are more difficult to spot inconsistencies in, even to individuals who would label themselves as being more tech-savvy,\" Beene said. \"Unfortunately, the allure of having a potential employer heavily interested in hiring you can blind people to the deception going on behind the messaging.\"\nAfter victims click to fill out a job application, they are often taken to fake pages, which ask for their financial information and then rob them of hundreds or thousands of dollars. They can also be sent malware, via an email attachment or link, by a purported job recruiter.\nIn a recent report, LinkedIn said it catches more than 99 percent of fake accounts, which made up roughly 60 million profiles in 2022. But 196,000 profiles were taken off the site only after users complained.\nA recent federal jobs report showed the United States added a booming 303,000 jobs in March, and scammers are looking to capitalize wherever they can.\n\"Graduation season is around the corner, and scammers are taking advantage of young and naive job seekers ready to hit the real-world post-grad after college, eagerly jumping on any opportunity that comes their way,\" Zulfikar Ramzan, the chief scientist and executive VP of product and development at online security platform Aura, told Newsweek.\nIt's easy for many job seekers to be led astray when they read descriptions of work from home roles that don't have many job requirements or needed skill sets. Scammers can even be advanced enough to create fake headshots for a recruiter and use formulaic language that replicates job postings that recruiters would actually write.\nWhen job seekers are asked for their Social Security number before accepting a job offer, they might mistakenly believe it's a routine part of setting up direct deposit payment.\nJob seekers can look out for key things, even when they're desperate to get back to work. For instance, a job application should never ask you for your bank account number or ask you to pay for equipment or training for the job.\n\"Unless the entity you're talking with has a verified online presence, you need to stay away,\" Beene said. \"Under no circumstances should you be giving out bank information to an employer unless you've been officially hired and their human resources department is asking you for the information for direct deposit and the documents being filled out are legal and binding.\"\nThose who believe they've been scammed should immediately report the scam to their banking institution.\n\"Job seekers must approach their search with heightened skepticism,\" HR consultant Bryan Driscoll told Newsweek. \"Any job offer requiring payment for training, equipment or background checks should raise red flags. Legitimate employers do not ask for money.\"\nRamzan said many of the fake job listings include roles like \"package handlers\" or \"shopping coordinators.\" There's also been a significant rise in the \"start your own online business\" scam.\n\"Depending on the scam, you may be asked to buy educational materials or sell goods and recruit new business owners,\" Ramzan said. \"The goods you buy will prove worthless, or you'll only make money by inviting others to join your team and work with you.\"\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n",

Do you know how many teachers you could hire for $1.5 billion? Do you know how many people you could put on health care with 1.5 billion dollars? What are we doing here folks?

County property records suggest many of them would be in line for multi-million-dollar refunds.\n\"Refunds and tax credits aimed at attracting or retaining businesses can be a double-edged sword,\" Ryan told Newsweek. \"On one side, they can spark investment, job growth and shore up a state's competitiveness. But they also drain funds that could go towards other priorities like education, infrastructure or social services.\"\nBusinesses will have between May 15 and November 30 to apply for the rebates available.\n\"Ultimately, this could be a boost to Tennessee businesses dealing with increasing costs,\" Beene said. \"Having some money in the form of a refund could provide some needed additional funds in the current economy.\"\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n",

        "content": "Florida's rising home prices are a \"worrying sign\" for the housing market, experts revealed in a recent study on the Miami metro area.\nFlorida Atlantic University and Florida International University said in their report that the soaring housing premiums in the Miami market are \"a potential worrying sign for the housing market,\" even as rents slow down and interest rates remain high.\nThe study found the average home in south Florida is 34.7 percent overvalued relative to its long-term pricing costs. That's an increase of 15 points from a month earlier.\n\"This trend does concern me as prices are still going up in the Miami metropolitan area, but not in the rest of the measured areas in Florida,\" FAU real estate economist Ken Johnson said in a statement. \"Price growth should be tepid considering the slowdown in rents and rising interest rates, but South Florida prices continue to rise despite these market forces.\"\nJohnson said the rise in south Florida's premiums may reflect a supply issue in the local market that is not yet addressed.\n\"We want property prices for an area to closely track the area's long-term property pricing trend,\" Johnson said. \"This allows purchases today to be worth more soon without worrying about home prices violently swinging above and below the trend.

        "content": "Doctors have issued a warning over \"dangerous\" sun protection trends on social media after a new study found 1 in 7 Americans under 35 think daily sunscreen use is more harmful than direct sun exposure.\nIn a new national survey, Rajesh Nair, an oncology surgeon at the Orlando Health Cancer Institute, and his team found that young adults are likely to believe myths and misinformation around sun protection, with 14 percent of 18- to 35-year-olds believing the risks of sunscreen outweigh the dangers of sun exposure.\n\"People buy into a lot of really dangerous ideas that put them at added risk,\" Nair told Newsweek.\n\"The main concerning information I see disseminated is that the downsides of sunscreen are so terrible, it is better to put yourself at a very high risk not only for melanoma but multiple other skin cancers,\" Nair said. \"We are seeing melanoma so much more often in really young people and the simple application of sunscreen can go such a long way in preventing life-threatening problems.\"\nAs well as misinformation regarding the safety of sunscreen, the study also highlighted several concerning trends promising \"natural\" sun protection. For example, nearly 1 in 4 under-35s believe drinking water prevents sunburn.\n\"There is no scientific data suggesting that drinking water provides any protection from the sun,\" Nair said.\nSkin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States, with as many as 3 million people being diagnosed with skin cancer every year, according to the American Cancer Society. The most dangerous form of skin cancer is melanoma, which accounts for the large majority of skin cancer deaths.\nAccording to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, melanoma rates have steadily increased in the U.S. since 1999. And while the risk of melanoma increases as we age, it is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer between the ages of 25 and 39.\nMost skin cancers are caused by too much exposure to UV radiation, from the sun or tanning beds. And yet, only about 1 in 8 men and 1 in 3 women over the age of 18 wear sunscreen when they're outside on a sunny day for more than an hour.\n\"I think a lot of people don't like how sunscreen makes their skin feel,\" Nair said. \"Especially for those who have naturally oily skin, sunscreen can make the skin feel worse or exacerbate acne. There have [also] been concerns raised about certain chemicals some sunscreens have. [But] the bottom line is that the benefits sunscreen confers far outweighs the downsides.\"\nIn the U.S., sunscreen is classified as an over-the-counter drug, which means it must be closely monitored by the FDA. Two common sunscreen ingredients—zinc oxide and titanium oxide—have been confirmed to be generally recognized as safe and effective. However, a further 12 ingredients, including avobenzone, oxybenzone and homosalate, have not been granted this status due to \"inadequate data to support a safety finding.\"\nThis does not mean that they are necessarily unsafe, but if you are at all concerned, there are plenty of mineral-based sunscreens that do not contain these chemicals.\n\"There are two main types of sunscreen; barrier and chemical. Barrier sunscreens sit on the surface of the skin and reflect the damaging UV radiation,\" Nair said. \"Chemical sunscreens are absorbed into the skin and convert the radiation into heat which is then dissipated. Chemical sunscreens tend to be a little bit more durable and resistant to sweat and being in the water. Barrier sunscreens typically carry less concern regarding the toxicity of the chemicals within them.\"\nFor now, the safety risks of not wearing sunscreen far outweigh any potential concerns surrounding its ingredients. But even those who do religiously wear sunscreen might be putting it on wrong.\n\"It is important to apply the sunscreen a good amount of time before you plan on being outdoors,\" Nair said. \"It takes at least 15 minutes for your skin to truly absorb the sunscreen and offer the protection you want.\n\"The other thing we all are guilty of forgetting is reapplication. At a minimum, sunscreen should be reapplied every two hours and should certainly be reapplied if you get wet in the water or are sweating.\"\nNair also recommended the following tips:\n\"We don't want to discourage people from being outside and being active because there are so many health benefits to that, but it's also important to know that sun protection can be lifesaving, and the only effective way of protecting yourself is limiting the effects of UV radiation on the skin,\" Nair said.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n",

However, national surveys show that more than seven in 10 high schoolers are not getting enough sleep.\nThere are several reasons for this. One is that, from about the age of 13, our natural body clock shifts slightly later, so teens often find it difficult to get to sleep. Combine this with early school mornings, homework, after school activities and screentime, it's no wonder many teens are struggling to get their Zs.\nNot all teenagers are equally affected and, according to a new study published in the journal Frontiers in Sleep, the \"cool kids\" might be having the hardest time.\n\"We show that popular teenagers reported shorter sleep duration,\" Serena Bauducco, a sleep researcher at Örebro University in Sweden and first author of the new study, said in a statement. \"In particular, popular girls—but not boys—reported more insomnia symptoms.\"\nTheir study investigated a sample of more than 1,300 Swedish teenagers aged 14 to 18. They were each asked to nominate up to three friends, and those who received the most nominations were considered to be the most \"popular.\"\nInterestingly, those who were considered to be the most popular slept less than their peers—up to 27 minutes for those who were considered the \"most popular.\"\nSo is this just because the cool kids spend more time texting? \"Most interestingly, popularity also seems to negatively impact sleep both before and after the advent of smartphones,\" Bauducco said.\nWhen analyzing girls and boys separately, more popular girls experience difficulties falling asleep, staying asleep and often woke up too early. Popular boys, meanwhile, did not experience these symptoms to a significant extent.\nExactly why these gender disparities exist is unclear, but the researchers suggest it might be something to do with the types of friendships girls and boys tend to have at that age. \"Girls express more care and concern with their friends and engage in helping behaviors more than boys,\" Bauducco said. \"This might mean they carry these concerns when it's time to fall asleep.\"\nSocializing is an important part of becoming an adult and, irrespective of popularity, these results add to a growing body of evidence that school schedules are not accommodating teenagers' sleep needs.\n\"Teenagers are arguably the most sleep deprived population throughout the lifespan,\" Bauducco said. \"Previous studies show that 30 minutes of extra sleep can lead to improved mental health and better school performance.\"\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n",

Exercising their whole bodies at once is a better method than training specific groups of muscles at a time, but due to the moon's low gravity, walking or running at speed results in bizarre and ridiculous bouncing.\nResearchers from the University of Milan have instead suggested a strange solution: Astronauts could run along vertical walls of a cylinder-shaped room.\n\"Here, we propose a novel solution: lunar inhabitants could engage in running on the inside of vertical circular walls, hence running parallel to the Moon's surface,\" they wrote in the paper. \"Such an activity on Earth is reserved for motorized vehicles during stunt exhibitions [called 'Wall of Death' (WoD)] but could be done by humans on the Moon and would generate enough centrifugal acceleration to emulate a higher level of gravity.\"\nUsing a rented fairground attraction to simulate low gravity, the researchers tested if this would be possible in lunar gravity. They found that in a cylinder with a radius of about 15.4 feet, running at a speed of around 12-14.5 mph not only allowed the astronauts to successfully run around the walls but gave them enough centrifugal force toward the walls to mimic gravity.\n\"To emulate Lunar gravity, 83 percent of body weight was unloaded by pre-tensed [36-meter] bungee-jumping bands,\" the researchers wrote. \"Participants unprecedentedly maintained horizontal fast running [5.4-6.5 meters per second (mps)] for a few circular laps, with intense metabolism and peak forces during foot contact, inferred by motion analysis, of 2-3 Earth body weight [corresponding to terrestrial running at 3-4 mps], high enough to prevent bone calcium resorption.\n\"A training regime of a few laps a day promises to be a viable countermeasure for astronauts to quickly combat whole-body deconditioning, for further missions and home return.\"\nDo you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?

        "content": "Saber-toothed tigers may have had two sets of their famous fangs for a period of their adolescence, fossil evidence reveals.\nOne species of these ancient and extinct cats, famed for their large and powerful saber-like teeth, is named Smilodon fatalis. The discovery of over 2,000 of these cats' skulls at the La Brea Tar Pits near Los Angeles established them as California's state fossil.\nMany of these skulls were found with double fangs, which were initially thought to be a fluke. But it turns out that these famous sabers may have had their baby tooth counterparts for several years, according to a study in the journal The Anatomical Record.\nIn humans, baby teeth are lost as the adult tooth grows below, pushing the baby tooth out of the gum. Many other species of animals, including cats, undergo a similar process as juveniles approach adulthood.\nA few of the La Brea saber-toothed cat skulls showed a strange feature: the saber tooth socket was occupied by two teeth, with the adult tooth slotted into the baby tooth. According to the paleontologists, this wasn't a freak of nature but instead a regular part of the maturing process of this species.\n\"What we do see is milk canines preserved on specimens with otherwise adult dentition, which suggests a prolonged retention of those milk canines while the adult tooth, the sabers, are either about to erupt or erupting,\" said paleontologist Jack Tseng, an associate professor of integrative biology at the University of California, Berkeley, in a statement. He is also a co-author of the study.\nSmilodon fatalis is one of the most well-known and extensively studied species of saber-toothed cats, along with others like Smilodon gracilis and Smilodon populator. Smilodon fatalis lived in the Americas during the Pleistocene epoch, from about 2.5 million to about 10,000 years ago, and is known for its long, curved canine teeth, which could grow up to 7 inches long.\nThese teeth adapted to deliver deep, fatal blows to the neck or belly of its prey, which likely included large herbivores such as bison, camels and young mammoths or mastodons. Smilodon fatalis was similar in size to a modern large lion, weighing between 350 and 620 pounds, making it one of the largest predators of its time.\nThese cats may have had both their baby and adult saber teeth simultaneously for around 30 months of their adolescence, after which the baby tooth would fall out and leave only the adult fang, according to the researchers.\nThis strange system helped stabilize the growing adult tooth, protecting it from lateral breakage during its eruption, the theory goes.\n\"This new study is a confirmation—a physical and simulation test—of an idea some collaborators and I published a couple of years ago: that the timing of the eruption of the sabers has been tweaked to allow a double-fang stage,\" Tseng said.\nHe continued: \"Imagine a timeline where you have the milk canine coming out, and when they finish erupting, the permanent canine comes out and overtakes the milk canine, eventually pushing it out. What if this milk tooth, for the 30 or so months that it was inside the mouth right next to this permanent tooth, was a mechanical buttress?\"\nThe researchers modeled the strength of the growing saber tooth and also tested the strength of plastic model teeth. They suggest that the milk tooth helped to stabilize the tooth as the animal got used to wielding such a long saber.\n\"During the time period when the permanent tooth is erupting alongside the milk one, it is around the time when you switch from maximum width to the relatively narrower width, when that tooth will be getting weaker,\" Tseng said. \"When you add an additional width back into the beam theory equation to account for the baby saber, the overall stiffness more closely aligned with theoretical optimal.\"\nIn the paper, the researchers said this development may also have evolved in other species of saber-toothed cats, though no examples have yet been discovered in the fossil record.\nThis study also changes the way researchers think about how these cats hunted during their adolescence and adulthood, as their canines would have become more vulnerable after the milk tooth fell out. They therefore may have relied more on predatory stealth or muscular strength to overwhelm their prey, using their sabers only for a major offensive when there was less danger of them breaking during their adolescent years.\n\"The double-fang stage is probably worth a rethinking now that I've shown there's this potential insurance policy, this larger range of protection,\" Tseng said.\n\"It allows the equivalent of our teenagers to experiment, to take risks, essentially to learn how to be a full-grown, fully fledged predator. I think that this refines, though it doesn't solve, thinking about the growth of saber tooth use and hunting through a mechanical lens,\" he said,\nDo you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?

        "content": "Astronomers have mapped the weather on a planet hundreds of light years away, and found that it always has clear skies on the side facing its sun.\nThis distant exoplanet, named WASP-43 b, is a hot gas giant orbiting a star around 280 light years away from our solar system, and dramatic weather patterns have been detected, including winds of up to 5,000 mph at its equator, according to a new paper in the journal Nature Astronomy.\nThis far-off mapping of the planet's weather was made possible thanks to the power of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which is able to measure variations in temperatures and the gases in the atmosphere of exoplanets many billions of miles away from Earth.\nWASP-43 b is a \"hot Jupiter\" type planet with an atmosphere mostly made from hydrogen, water, and helium. It orbits its star (named WASP-43) at a very close 1.3 million miles, only 4 percent of the distance between our sun and its closest planet, Mercury.\nThe close proximity to its star has led to it becoming tidally locked, which means one side always faces toward the star and the other always faces away—just like the moon orbiting the Earth.\n\"With Hubble, we could clearly see that there is water vapor on the dayside. Both Hubble and Spitzer suggested there might be clouds on the nightside,\" study co-author Taylor Bell, a researcher from the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute and the NASA Ames Research Center, said in a statement.\n\"But we needed more precise measurements from JWST to really begin mapping the temperature, cloud cover, winds, and more detailed atmospheric composition all the way around the planet.\"\nNow, the JWST has spied the weather patterns on this distant world, confirming that it has only water vapor and no clouds on its day side, high-up and thick clouds on its night side, and powerful winds around its equator mixing gases between the two sides.\n\"JWST is a game changer for studying exoplanet atmospheres, and in less than two years of science operations we have already learned so much,\" co-author Joanna Barstow, a research fellow at the Open University, said in the statement.\nThese discoveries were made by watching the star as the planet passed in front of it during its rapid 19.5-hour orbit around its sun. JWST's infrared system was used to measure light from the star every 10 seconds across 24 hours.\n\"By observing over an entire orbit, we were able to calculate the temperature of different sides of the planet as they rotate into view,\" said Bell. \"From that, we could construct a rough map of temperature across the planet.\"\nThe researchers found that the day side of the planet was hot enough to melt iron at a staggering 2,282 degrees F, while the night side was a much milder 1,112 degrees F. They then used 3D atmospheric models to calculate the likely weather on the planet, finding that the night side was probably covered in thick clouds, while the day side was clear-skied.\n\"JWST has given us an opportunity to figure out exactly which molecules we're seeing,\" said Barstow.\nThey also found that there were traces of water vapor on both the day and night sides, but there was little to no methane present in the atmosphere of the planet.\n\"The fact that we don't see methane tells us that WASP-43b must have wind speeds reaching something like 5,000 miles per hour,\" explained Barstow. \"If winds move gas around from the dayside to the nightside and back again fast enough, there isn't enough time for the expected chemical reactions to produce detectable amounts of methane on the nightside.\"\nThanks to this powerful wind, it's likely that the atmosphere is made up of the same elements all the way around the planet.\nDo you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?

The lawsuit, filed in the local court of Mecklenburg, North Carolina, details a series of allegations including unpaid commissions and breach of terms in Steiner's employment agreement, spanning from 2021 to 2023.\nSteiner's decision to sue his former employer centers primarily on financial disagreements and the misuse of his image. According to legal documents, Steiner has accused Haas of failing to pay amounts due under the terms of his employment contract. The case highlights a deeper contention surrounding the unauthorized commercial use of his likeness, particularly leveraging his popularity surge from the Netflix series 'Drive to Survive'.\n\"Haas F1 chose not to renew Mr. Steiner's Employment Agreement. This was its right. But Haas F1 has done what it has no right to do and refused to pay Mr. Steiner [amount redacted] owed under his Employment Agreement,\" the filings state, as quoted in the same Autosport report.\nFurther exacerbating the issue is Haas F1's alleged continuance to profit from Steiner's image and reputation without appropriate compensation, post his tenure with the team. The claim points to Haas using his persona to bolster the team's profile and attract revenue streams, critical in the financially intensive sphere of Formula 1 racing.\n\"After years of accepting the benefits of Mr. Steiner's reputation, experience, and deep connections within the sport, Haas F1 cannot withhold from Mr. Steiner the benefits he has earned,\" the document continues.\nSteiner's legal team argues that his significant contribution to enhancing the team's visibility and marketability through media exposure was invaluable, particularly as the team navigated the costly terrain of Formula 1.\n\"Haas F1 was frequently featured in the series, and Mr. Steiner's presence in the show drove more and more fans to Haas F1.\n\"This exposure was extremely valuable to the upstart racing team, particularly as it looked for additional revenue streams to support itself in the notoriously expensive Formula 1 environment,\" according to court papers.\nMoreover, the filings shed light on a crucial aspect of Steiner's claim: \"Haas F1 has no right to use Mr. Steiner's name, image, and likeness or to exploit them in any form of media after the termination of his employment. Haas F1 has not compensated Mr. Steiner for its unauthorized use of his name, image, and likeness.\"\nLast year, Haas F1 chose not to renew Steiner's contract, instead giving the role to Ayao Komatsu.

Newey joined Red Bull Racing in 2006 and transformed the team into a dominant force in Formula One. Under his guidance, Red Bull clinched its first Constructors' title in 2010, followed by three more consecutive titles. His expertise not only supported Sebastian Vettel in earning four Drivers' Championships but also played a crucial role in the team's ongoing competitiveness in the hybrid era.\nThe transition from V8 engines to V6 turbo hybrids marked a challenging phase for Red Bull, primarily due to the less competitive power units from their engine partners.

When asked if Monday night's game was potentially his last with the Lakers, James simply said, \"I'm not going to answer that.\"\nJames recently alluded to the fact that his impending retirement was coming soon, but he didn't specify exactly when that would be. While James made it clear he was going to take some time to be with his family and make a decision, numerous reports then came out regarding his future not only with the Lakers, but in the NBA as a whole.\nOne report from The Athletic said James was planning on playing up to two more seasons in the league. Another report from ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski said James \"in all likelihood\" would be back with the Lakers on a two- or three-year deal.\nJames clearly saw all the reports, because on Tuesday night, he took to social media to make his intentions clear.\n\"I've seen, heard a lot of reports about my future,\" James said on X. \"I said it last night and I'll say it again.

If he declines the option, he could sign a max extension that could reach three years and $164 million, which would take him through his age-42 season.\nJames proved this past season that he could still play at a high level. The 39-year-old appeared in 71 regular season games — his most since 2017-18 — and averaged 25.7 points, 8.3 assists and 7.3 rebounds per game. He made the All-Star team for a 20th consecutive season, and was arguably the Lakers' best and most consistent player all year long.\nHowever, James made it clear that he's accomplished everything there is to accomplish at the NBA level, and at some point, he has to hang it up and be with his family.\n\"I got a family,\" James said, per ESPN's Dave McMenamin. \"I got a 9-year-old daughter [Zhuri]. I got a son [Bronny] that's in college, that's deciding if he's going to go to college or go pro. I got a son [Bryce] that's about to be a senior in high school.

        "content": "Recently, Lando Norris voiced strong concerns about Formula 1's expanded 24-race season during a press conference following the Chinese Grand Prix. He admitted that the packed schedule is harsh on team mechanics and not sustainable long-term.\nThe discussion around the sustainability of increasing race schedules has come into sharp focus amid the ongoing record-breaking 24-race 2024 season. Lando Norris recently criticized the extended calendar, particularly highlighting the strain it places on team staff.\nNorris expressed his perspective at a media session after the Chinese Grand Prix, where he pointed out multiple drawbacks related to the burgeoning number of races. He said, as quoted by Motorsport Week:\n\"I'd always prefer the old, original race format [as opposed to the sprint race format]. This is what I've grown up watching, it's what I've always liked the most.\"\nHe didn't stop there; the McLaren driver added:\n\"I do like just going in and having the pressure straight away. So the fact of having one practice straight into qualifying, I do like it.\n\"I think it gives people less chance to just get the car perfect and I think that's when you just start to see [a sequence of] team, team, team, team rather than a mix. So I do think it works from that perspective.\n\"But the main point is just the toll it has on mechanics and engineers. I don't think it's too bad for us as drivers, honestly. I don't think we can be the ones to complain at all. It's the hundreds of mechanics and engineers that we have here that have to travel so much. It's not healthy for them. It is not sustainable.\n\"The problem is not with us so it's not something you should be asking us. It's something that people should look out more for the rest of the team. And I think that's a limiting factor, not the fact of can we go in the car every day, because I think we can but not doing too much for them I think is the priority.\"\nThe increasing number of races and added formats have been met with similar disapproval from other top drivers. Max Verstappen and Fernando Alonso also shared critical viewpoints on the current F1 agenda. Verstappen candidly remarked, \"F1 is way over the limit. I won't be racing in Formula 1 for another 10 years doing 24 races per season.\"\nAlonso, with years of experience to back his claims, voiced, \"This is not sustainable for the future. I think for anyone.\" His statement points towards an emerging consensus among drivers about the limits of what is reasonable within the sport.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n",

Click here for the full series page.\nWhen the iPhone came out in 2005, I wasn't among the first in line, but I did buy one. Two weeks later, surprised that my new device was doing exactly what it was designed to do—addicting me—I replaced it with a no-frills Nokia, which I used for the next thirteen years.\nThen, on January 15, 2018, I put my Nokia in a drawer forever. Why? Because I'm haunted by the image of myself looking at my phone to the exclusion of everything else around me. Mostly I remember resenting that a cartoonish cube of metal and glass had taken control of my life. The \"endless and proper work\" of paying attention is an essential part of the work I do. Why would I use something that compromised my ability to be great at my job?\nEven though I'm currently in my sixth year without a phone, I decided to reach out to Nir Eyal, named by The M.I.T. Technology Review as, \"The Prophet of Habit-Forming Technology,\" to try to get to the bottom of phone addiction and understand why we check our phones even though we haven't received any notifications.\nEyal is the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products and Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life, selling over 1 million copies in over 30 languages.\nThe conversation proved fascinating — despite our differences, I was amazed to find an astounding number of similarities. I also came away having learned a few tricks that I still use to this day.\nSay, for example, you're at a business dinner and one of the patrons is constantly looking down at their phone. Instead of ignoring them, Nir's strategy is to confront them with concern: ask them in a sincere way: \"I can see that you're on the phone a lot – is everything okay – is there anything I can do to help?\"\nAs we dug deeper towards the root question that inspired our sit down, Nir's explanations brought me back to my own decision to get rid of my phone. Our phones are a form of armor. A shield. A light saber. A one-handed defense against our own fear, anxiety, aloneness, self-consciousness, stillness, sadness, and insignificance. A notification means someone cares. It means that we're important.\nI get it.\nAnd yet, when I'm walking along the street and someone glued to his or her phone crashes into me, followed by a quick, rueful \"Sorry...\" I can't help feeling an irrational rage. \"Don't you understand what you're doing?\" I want to say. Is this really how you want to spend your one wild and precious life?\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n",

Click here for the full series page.\nIt's not every day I get the chance to sit down with a Nobel laureate, but the challenging question raised by Newsweek left me no choice. Why do we procrastinate on taxes?\nWhether we like to admit it, we've all been there. Breaking up, fixing that dripping tap, learning that new skill — the list goes on. A friend of mine recently procrastinated on his health check, likely suspecting that the message he would receive wouldn't be rosy. According to a recent study, 20 to 25 percent of the adult population procrastinates regularly, while a staggering 70 to 95 percent of all students report procrastinating on academic tasks.\nAnd then there's that dreaded tax return hanging over our heads.\nSo I sat down with economist Richard Thaler — recipient of the 2017 Nobel Prize for his pioneering contributions to behavioral economics and best-selling author of the book, Nudge. Thaler's work fundamentally challenged the traditional economic assumption that individuals always act rationally, laying the groundwork for the concept of \"nudge theory.\" Since procrastination is itself irrational, Thaler seemed the perfect choice to help me get to the bottom of my quandary.\nFrom the onset, Thaler wasn't anything like what I was expecting from a Nobel laureate. Despite the seriousness of his work, I found Thaler fun and approachable. When I asked him about the Prize, he merely laughed and told me that he assumed the Nobel committee in Stockholm probably couldn't get hold of their first choice, so he got the call as a last minute stand-in. Despite his self-deprecatory nature, it didn't take more than a few minutes with Thaler to see his brilliant mind at work.\nBut back to taxes.\nDid you know that if you just inform the tax authorities that you'll be filing late, in most instances nothing will happen? But we choose instead to procrastinate, incurring penalties which could just as easily have been cleared up with a dose of candor and honesty!\nJoin my conversation with Richard Thaler where we cover everything from urinals, Richard's love affair with a sound button, and of course his take on why we procrastinate.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n",

        "content": "Clean energy doesn't just generate power — it generates jobs.\nA recent analysis by the Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, commissioned by the BlueGreen Alliance, found that the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act's climate, energy, and environmental investments will create over nine million jobs in the next decade.\nAnd college-educated workers are not the main beneficiaries of this eco-friendly economic boom. Two-thirds of the direct job creation is projected to provide homegrown opportunities to rural, blue-collar workers, with a myriad of employment opportunities for skilled trade workers such as technicians, construction laborers, manufacturing assemblers, fabricators, carpenters, and more.\nRead more: Compare the Best Solar Panels\nHowever, while the IRA legislation offers unprecedented employment possibilities in the U.S., especially among the skilled working class, it also introduces challenges that must be addressed. As we strategize for the future, labor shortages, an aging workforce, and a lack of diversity must be at the forefront of our minds. We must ensure that all Americans benefit from this shift to clean energy, regardless of their background, experience, or location.\nHow do we create a clean energy workforce that looks like America? By implementing strategies supported by both public sector and private sector dollars.\nMany areas transitioning from a dependence on fossil fuels to clean energy are under-resourced communities. These residents are dealing firsthand with the burdens of climate change. However, many of these potential workers must be made aware of the opportunities in the clean energy industry and the new skills needed to secure a stable, fulfilling, well-paid position.\nTo address this, the Biden administration is offering $40 million to train and certify clean energy workers. In addition, some mission-driven companies, such as Reactivate, are investing in solar energy projects and training in underserved neighborhoods.\nThere is still much work to be done, but investments like these can help workers transition from declining industries, such as coal mines, to build clean energy technologies of the future, such as solar panels and wind turbines.\nOnly some skills needed for the clean energy workforce must be learned from scratch. A lot of the expertise used by those in the fossil fuel industry can be transferred to clean energy. For example, the same electrical work used at fossil fuel plants can be used for a wind or solar project. Some of the best skill profiles for geothermal jobs are coal miners.\nThose invested in seeing clean energy succeed must reach out to electricians, crane operators, and others with transferable skills to explain and educate how these workers' skills can contribute to the climate solutions we're all trying to solve.\nOnce the workforce is properly trained in clean energy, we need to ensure a job is waiting for them on the other side. Too often, the training programs are too long and do not guarantee employment afterward. However, many clean energy companies are looking to hire the right people.\nThe solution is to shorten the training requirements and ensure job security on the backend. The training programs need to be direct feeders into active projects.\nWe have overemphasized the importance of a four-year college education and stigmatized shorter vocational education in this country. That needs to change. We need to start training those interested in vocational jobs as early as middle and high school and get them apprenticeships and mentorships with skilled workers much earlier in their education. We must elevate the status of some of the most essential workers we depend on, from technicians to electricians. Let's begin training a whole new generation of workers to take us into the clean energy era.\nRead more: Federal Solar Tax Credit Guide\nI've personally seen the positive impact these types of federal programs can have. My great-grandfather was an engineer, and my grandfather was an electrician, working on the Panama Canal. That enormous government project didn't get done overnight but changed the world in many ways. It changed my world because it enabled my family to experience the American Dream. I likely wouldn't be writing these words if this country hadn't come together to complete a future-forward and unprecedented project.\nLet's come together today to support the efforts of creating clean energy jobs that will offer the same life-changing opportunities for a new generation of hardworking people.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n",

        "content": "Innovation is often thought of as a spontaneous \"lightbulb\" moment that comes in a stroke of creative genius. However, instead of waiting for those moments to arrive by chance, organizations can foster continuous innovation by intentionally and strategically cultivating it.\nTo help leaders achieve this goal, 14 Newsweek Expert Forum members share their insights on how to develop a more structured, intentional approach to innovation. From establishing cross-functional teams to setting aside dedicated time for creative thinking, here are their top recommendations for modern leaders.\nInnovation and creativity are entirely about a willingness to try out ideas without knowing that they will work. That's also a description of play and a description of failure. My advice is to make space for play (Google's 20% time is a great example of this) and make it safe to fail. Wayne Gretzky fell down in practice a lot more than other players; it's why he was the best on the ice. - Bryan Boroughs, Institute for Child Success\nFirst, ensure teams get outside the organization to explore new developments and trends. This can provide inspiration and help them stay current. Then, carve out time for dedicated discussions to generate and vet fresh ideas. Lastly, provide teams with access to the resources needed to drive innovations forward. Ensure they understand what will take effort and what will require new infrastructure. - Alexa Kimball, Harvard Medical Faculty Physicians at Beth Israel Deaconess\nThe most innovative companies are the best listeners. They are deliberate in anticipating where their customers are going and evolving their solutions to get in front of their needs. Being reactive in investment decisions just to keep up with the \"next big trend\" is not the answer if it does not serve customers or your business's larger strategic goals. - Steve Smith, Zayo\nCompanies can adopt a more structured approach to innovation by implementing meeting-free blocks or days. This allows uninterrupted time for creativity to flourish by reducing transitions and interruptions, which are known to hinder creativity. Leaders must model and endorse this practice to foster a culture of innovation, as it encourages deep focus and ideation, ultimately leading to impactful outcomes. - Leah Marone, Corporate Wellness Consultant\nCompanies can implement a formal innovation funnel, guiding ideas through stages like ideation, prototyping and testing. A culture of psychological safety is crucial for employees to share ideas. It provides a systematic process for vetting and maintaining a creative spark while also allowing for potential varying financial awards. - Alan Wozniak, Business Health Matters (BHM) Executive Consulting\nInnovation leverages creativity, ingenuity and problem-solving to produce new ideas, products, services, solutions and ways of living and being. Many innovative breakthroughs occur by accident. Companies can cultivate innovative outcomes with structured and intentional approaches like cross-functional collaboration, design thinking practices, continuous learning and productive risk-taking. - Lillian Gregory, The 4D Unicorn LLC\nI would propose implementing idea incubation rituals. Consider scheduling undisturbed, regular sessions for employees where they disconnect from routine tasks to nurture and brainstorm new ideas. It is an idea grounded in the psychological incubation theory, which asserts that creativity can emerge from subconscious to conscious thoughts, thus encouraging breakthrough innovations. - Dr. Kira Graves, Kira Graves Consulting\nConduct regular strategic planning sessions focused on innovation. These sessions should involve stakeholders from various departments and levels of the organization to promote cross-functional collaboration. The aim is to align innovation efforts with long-term business goals and strategies, ensuring a more structured and collaborative approach to innovation. - Gergo Vari, Lensa\nEstablish cross-functional teams that encourage diverse perspectives and collaboration. By creating a culture that values and rewards experimentation and learning from failure, organizations can stimulate creativity and adaptability. This will lead to more innovative solutions and a competitive edge in the market. - Anna Yusim, MD, Yusim Psychiatry, Consulting & Executive Coaching\nLaunch a formal innovation management system that encourages idea generation, evaluation and implementation. Based on my experience at Greif, one key piece of advice is scheduling cross-functional innovation master classes to harness diverse perspectives, enhance creativity and apply them to practical problems. These classes promote a collaborative culture, driving impactful and sustainable innovation. - Bala Sathyanarayanan, GREIF Inc.\nImplement a dedicated innovation management system (IMS) by establishing a formal process and framework for managing and nurturing innovation within the organization. An effective IMS includes mechanisms for idea generation, selection, development and commercialization, which is supported by a culture that encourages creativity and risk-taking. - Britton Bloch, Navy Federal\nThe one piece of advice I have for structured innovation is to adopt the Toyota Production System concept. This is where a team looks at all the elements of an idea, pros and cons, and works on challenges to overcome any obstacles before implementing the idea. This ensures the idea has a reasonable chance of success before it's implemented. - Baruch Labunski, Rank Secure\nI wouldn't use the word \"structured\" to achieve innovation and breakthroughs. Sometimes, the best solutions come from outside the industry. One piece of advice I would give is not to immediately try to fix a problem. Instead, understand the nature of the problem and the complications surrounding it. Obviously, if the ship is sinking you need to plug the hole—but oftentimes, some careful scrutiny works better. - Zain Jaffer, Zain Ventures\nA well-established framework for innovation comprises key performance indicators and metrics to monitor progress and evaluate the impact of innovation initiatives. This approach, which is based on data, offers significant insights into what's effective and what's not, allowing businesses to iterate and enhance their innovation processes over time. - Tammy Sons, Tn Nursery\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n",

        "content": "Within each of us lies a potent force, capable of unlocking the doors to fulfillment, prosperity, and influence. Yet, despite its omnipresence in our lives, this power often goes unnoticed, its transformative potential underestimated. What, you may ask, is this enigmatic force?\nIt's not the power of the mind, nor is it the magic of visualization or positive thinking.\nSurprise! This superpower is our own feelings and emotions.\nMany systems of philosophy, spirituality and self-improvement systems treat emotions as a nuisance, a thing to get rid of in order to achieve true inner peace. Many of them credit the mind as the source of achievement and progress.\nHowever, overlooked and underestimated, it's the emotions and feelings that drive us toward achievement from behind the scenes.\nTake a moment to reflect — feelings permeate every facet of our existence. Notice that people do what they \"feel like\" doing and avoid the things they \"don't feel like\" doing.\nWhen people feel like doing something, they feel motivated, excited, and eager to move forward. This is called motivation. Even though many experts instruct their followers to create motivation for whatever they \"should\" do, most of us know that that kind of \"motivation\" feels like slugging through the task. Motivation cannot be manufactured.\nLet's take a look at what gives meaning to our lives. For some people, it's achieving certain goals or milestones. That's because they feel accomplished, proud, and satisfied. For most of us, it's our relationships that give meaning to life. As the old saying goes at the end of their lives, nobody wishes they had spent more time in the office. Not surprisingly, relationships are based on emotional connections.\nIn the arts, what captures our attention and gets us engaged are emotions and feelings. Novels captivate us with tales of love, adventure, and mystery, urging us to turn pages while we hold our breath from excitement. We don't have the same excitement about manuals or technical instructions.\nIn music, all songs are about passion: feeling loved or unloved; despair and anguish of abandonment or betrayal; anger about personal relationships or the state of the world; or the blues and sorrow about our lives. Painters strive to portray the emotions of their sitters or evoke emotional reactions in the viewer.\nImagine how boring life would be without relationships, emotional connections, or the arts. But why do emotions wield such unparalleled influence over our lives?\nThe answer lies within our very biology. Nestled within the middle of our brains lies the limbic system, described by Dr. Paul MacLean in his Triune Brain model, as the power that governs our emotional responses and is responsible for creating emotional connections.\nContrary to the view adopted by Western science and psychology, emotions are not mere byproducts of cognition but essential components of our survival mechanism. That was the view expressed by Darwin himself. And there is a great deal of current neuroscience that confirms it.\nThat is why attempting to wrest control over our emotions through sheer force of will often proves futile. Emotions, like our fight-or-flight instincts, are ingrained within our psyche, serving as our indispensable protection mechanism.\nThere is no point in making people feel bad about themselves because they experience anger or fear. These feelings are biologically programmed into each and every one of us!\nBut contrary to prevailing beliefs, emotions are not adversaries to be vanquished. They are allies to be embraced. Yes, they are often out of balance. But rather than seeking to suppress emotional reactions, especially the so-called \"negative\" emotions, as human beings, we need to learn to understand and accept them.\nAs the saying goes, if you can't beat them, join them! You can't beat your emotions because you have the limbic system. The emotions and feelings are always going to be there, for good or bad. To make sure they are for good, make friends with them and let them help you unlock your fullest potential and realize your deepest aspirations.\nThe moral of this story: rather than use your mind to get rid of the \"undesirable emotions,\" use your mind to learn about them and from them. Embrace your superpower! It can help you create a life fulfilling beyond your wildest expectations.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n",

        "content": "Newsweek's core mission is to provide our readers with a deep and nuanced understanding of the world around them. That means embracing a truly global perspective. We aim to transcend surface-level narratives, offering coverage that creates opportunities for true international dialogue.\nTo many, the 21st century is also known as the Asian Century. Asia will lead the world in this next phase of global economic growth. According to Goldman Sachs, by 2050, the world's GDP will be $227.9 trillion. Asia will represent the largest share of global GDP growth at $90.6 trillion, followed by the developed economies at $82.9 trillion and then the rest of the world.\nOur recent exclusive interviews with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, masterfully conducted by our team led by Global Editor-in-Chief Nancy Cooper, are the latest example of this commitment. In this context, I see our role at Newsweek as not merely passive observers but as active facilitators of meaningful dialogue around the future of Asia.\nAs an American who was born and lived the early part of my life in India, I have a nuanced perspective on India's challenges and aspirations. The country's relatively nascent sovereignty, having emerged only 75 years ago from centuries of colonial rule, is a testament to its resilience. The journey from its colonial past to a vibrant democracy is a narrative I hold close to my heart, and it drives my commitment to ensure that Newsweek covers India with the depth and nuance it deserves.\nCoverage of India by mainstream international media at times gravitates toward simplistic narratives that fail to capture the profound complexity and vibrant diversity of the world's most populous nation. Typically, the portrayal emphasizes either the booming IT and economic sectors or the persistent challenges such as poverty and social friction, leaving little room for the varied perspectives beyond and in between.\nSuch coverage can overlook the rich cultural tapestry, the internal innovations in various sectors, and the distinct political dynamics, all shaped by thousands of years of history, that today stand at the nexus of geopolitical change. The level of optimism and pride I'm seeing among Indians—friends, family, and colleagues—is truly inspiring and unlike anything I've experienced before. The global stage is set to witness a confident India, and if the Indian diaspora's contribution to the U.S., the UK, and elsewhere is a preview, the world stands to gain much from India's rising prominence.\nThat's why Newsweek's interview with Prime Minister Modi and the associated story was not just a recitation of current events: Our coverage delved into the complex dynamics of India's geopolitical relationships and their broader implications for global affairs.\nModi's remarks to Newsweek on the Indo-China border disputes and his call for urgent resolution resonated globally, sparking reactions from major geopolitical players, including a direct response from the Chinese government. The response was immediate and extensive, with major news outlets like Bloomberg and BBC amplifying the discussion. The reaction from China was particularly significant, and its Foreign Ministry spokesperson highlighted hopes for diplomatic progress. This international engagement underscores the relevance of Newsweek's efforts and reaffirms our role in fostering meaningful global dialogue.\nA few weeks after our interview with Prime Minister Modi, we met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo. There, too, we gained fresh insights into the thoughts of a significant national leader and his approach to his country's challenges and opportunities.\nThe interview explored the country's pressing need for stronger partnerships with the U.S. and other regional allies to address what he described as \"the most challenging and complex security environment since the end of World War II,\" a situation exacerbated by recent military activities by China and North Korea. Throughout the interview, he frequently emphasized the term \"peace,\" underscoring Japan's intent to be assertive yet remain a peace-loving nation, obeying international rules.\nIt's our view that building a successful digital media company with global relevance today involves understanding political, economic, and social dynamics and committing to comprehensive reporting that resonates at the global stage and captures the evolution of the global order. In that respect, our recent India and Japan coverage serves as a kind of blueprint for Newsweek's global future. The impact of our interviews with Prime Minister Modi and Prime Minister Kishida and the accompanying stories highlights the critical role of media in international relations and democracy, reinforcing our commitment to journalism that not only reports but also enlightens.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n",

        "content": "Today, news media faces a number of structural challenges: deepening polarization, diminishing trust and a stark decline in reader engagement.\nAt Newsweek, we've delved deeply into the forces driving us here. One way we're addressing these concerns is the Fairness Meter, which allows readers to hold us accountable by rating an article's fairness on a five-way scale. Our fairness meter can be found at the bottom of select articles across Newsweek's editorial content and will help maintain a high standard of integrity, transparency, and accountability.\nThe landscape of polarization and eroding trust\nMedia's increasing polarization owes much to the dominance of social media, but the challenges began even before that with the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987.\nThis policy, which mandated the inclusion of diverse viewpoints, once ensured a breadth of perspectives in broadcast journalism — a formal balance that lent fairness and credibility to the format. Its removal marked the first shift toward what we see today: more extreme and polarized media narratives. Gallup's polls from 2021 and 2022 show that only 34% of Americans trust mass media, with a pronounced partisan divide — 70% of Democrats versus a mere 14% of Republicans trust mass media outlets.\nThis erosion of trust in news media is not an isolated phenomenon. It's part of a broader moment in which public confidence in many institutions has been waning. In an age when misinformation can spread rapidly over social media, the role of responsible media in providing accurate and unbiased information has become more important than ever. We must do what we can to restore this trust, and it begins at the core of the news product.\nChanging dynamics of reader participation\nParallel to the issue of trust is the evolution of reader participation. The digital age has transformed how audiences interact with news content.\nPost-2016 trends indicate a decline in engagement with traditional news outlets, particularly among younger demographics. Young people increasingly bypass traditional news platforms, turning instead to social media feeds and other digital channels for their news and information.\nThis shift has significant implications for how news organizations engage with their audiences and maintain relevance in the digital era.\nThe Fairness Meter\nNewsweek's Fairness Meter is one of our responses. First, it represents a commitment to deepening trust and enhancing reader engagement by involving our audience in the direct evaluation of our content. Second, the tool redefines the more traditional comment-based systems, instead opting for a structured and consistent way for readers to express their views on the fairness of our articles, providing a concrete method for readers to help shape and sharpen our journalistic tenets.\nHere's some of what we've learned after placing the Fairness Meter on over 1,000 stories since it was activated in September 2023.\nThe aspirations of the Fairness Meter aim to go beyond just gauging perceptions of fairness. It's one step in the direction of restoring trust in the relationship between the public and the news media.\nRepatriating news engagement to the news property\nOver time, social media has usurped news organizations as the forum for discussion and debate of news and current events. One byproduct has been the formation of information echo chambers, which often come to confirm the existing biases of different groupings of users. Social platforms — with finely tuned algorithms designed to amplify engagement — frequently prioritize sensational and controversial content, perspectives and comments, fueling what could be referred to as \"enragement engagement.\"\nThis shift has effectively taken over much of the discourse that was once a feature of news platforms. The Fairness Meter is an initiative to bring back reader engagement to the news platform itself.\nThe end of the ivory tower: A call for public accountability\nThe modern media landscape needs a fundamental shift in how news outlets address reader perceptions and engagement. The era of the journalistic \"ivory tower\" — where media outlets operate in isolation from their audience — is over. Today's media must open itself up to public accountability. The Fairness Meter is one way of demonstrating this new approach, allowing readers to actively participate in shaping the stories our journalists report on.\nIgnoring the imperative for engagement and transparency comes with significant risks. The decline in public trust and reader engagement on news platforms is a clear signal. This growing distrust, exacerbated by digital echo chambers and social media-fueled confirmation biases, threatens the foundation of credible journalism.\nThe Fairness Meter is not merely a feedback tool; it fosters dialogue and understanding and demonstrates respect for our audience's intelligence, acknowledging their critical role in shaping the way that we in the media work.\nOriginally published on Poynter.org\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n",

        "content": "In the annals of American broadcast journalism, the Fairness Doctrine stands as a testament to a time when balanced reporting was more than a noble pursuit; it was a mandated practice.\nThe policy, established by the Federal Communications Commission in 1949, obligated broadcasters to present contrasting viewpoints on contentious public issues.\nThis era of regulated balance came to an end in 1987 when President Ronald Reagan's FCC decided that the increasing diversity of media outlets meant the doctrine was no longer required. This pivotal shift laid the groundwork for significant transformations in the media landscape.\nIn the post-Fairness Doctrine era, we have witnessed an unprecedented polarization of American media. Freed from the obligation to present differing perspectives, many media outlets have defaulted to presenting narratives through a singular ideological lens.\nThe end of the Fairness Doctrine isn't the sole cause of media polarization, of course. The advent of social media and the algorithm-driven delivery of news, coupled with business incentives that prioritize engagement over balance, have exacerbated the divide. The outrage economy is a self-perpetuating system.\nThese shifts have profoundly affected our democratic society. Public discourse, once anchored in a commonly accepted set of facts, has fractured into micro-environments, subsets and cohorts, each espousing its unique version of reality. This accelerates the erosion of civil dialogue, undermining a critical component of our democracy. In this polarized media landscape, trust in the so-called fourth estate has plummeted to an all-time low.\nSocial media platforms, with their indiscriminate blending of content from trusted news outlets and dubious blogs, have furthered this erosion.\nThe shift towards subscription-based business models is a double-edged sword. While it has provided a lifeline to many media organizations in the face of shrinking advertising revenues, it has also inadvertently deepened the echo chambers. By prioritizing content that affirms their subscribers' worldviews, media outlets perpetuate these bubbles. And with quality journalism often locked behind paywalls, the information divide grows wider, further threatening the democratic ideal of an informed citizenry.\nIn the face of these challenges, it's crucial to remember that the principles of the Fairness Doctrine, though no longer legally enforced, needn't be abandoned. Instead, we should strive to voluntarily integrate these principles into our journalistic practices. By emphasizing fairness, balance and a representation of diverse viewpoints in our reporting, we can begin to counteract the rampant polarization that currently plagues our media and, by extension, our public discourse.\nNavigating today's media landscape is challenging. It's shaped by a web of social, technological and economic factors that defy easy solutions. Meanwhile, the erosion of civil dialogue, the declining trust in media, and the fragmentation of our public discourse pose serious threats to our democracy.\nWe need to raise our journalistic standards. Both-sides-ism isn't fairness — it's a failure of critical thinking or intellectual honesty. Let's not be naive: There are people and interests who deliberately skew our public discourse through misdirection, false equivalence and outright lies. We must counter those pernicious efforts by demanding a commitment to good-faith debate, which will pay dividends in rebuilding the trust that across the spectrum of ideas.\nAdopting a voluntary commitment to the principles embodied in the Fairness Doctrine represents a step in the right direction. It signals our dedication to upholding the ethical tenets of journalism, our respect for diverse viewpoints and our unwavering commitment to nourishing an informed and balanced public discourse.\nWhen fairness is no longer a doctrine, it must become a practice. Our democracy, in its present state, urgently requires this shift. For the media industry, it's not just a question of ethical responsibility but an existential imperative. The very health of our democratic society might depend on it.\nOriginally published on Poynter.org\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\n",
